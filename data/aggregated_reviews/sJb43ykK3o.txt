Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents RegaVAE, a retrieval-augmented language model that utilizes a variational auto-encoder (VAE) to address issues in current retrieval-augmented language models. The authors argue that retrieved information should encompass both current source text and future target text. RegaVAE encodes the text corpus into a latent space, capturing this dual information, and employs a Gaussian mixture distribution to enhance the generative process. The model demonstrates improved generative quality and reduced hallucinations compared to traditional retrieval generative models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles significant challenges in retrieval-augmented text generation that have not been extensively studied.
- It is well-written and organized, providing clear motivation, background, and technical details, including a theoretical analysis of the optimizable upper bound for the model.
- The experimental results show competitive performance against existing models on relevant datasets, supported by ablation studies and human evaluations.

Weaknesses:
- The appropriateness of the proposed approach for solving retrieval-augmented language model issues remains questionable, with limited comparisons to existing methods.
- The experimentation is weak, with inadequate and outdated baseline models that do not convincingly demonstrate superiority.
- The writing lacks substance and organization in certain areas, and discussions on potential drawbacks, such as computational cost and scalability, are insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental setup by including hyperparameter optimization details and computing budgets to enhance reproducibility. Additionally, addressing the computational cost and scalability of the proposed model would strengthen the discussion. Clarifying how the model handles ambiguous future information and irrelevant retrieved documents would also be beneficial. Lastly, we suggest including error bars in evaluation results and providing representative examples of generated text comparisons in the appendix to support the findings more robustly.
