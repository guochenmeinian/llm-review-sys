Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents PI-FL, an incentive-aware federated learning method that integrates clustered personalization with a token-based incentive mechanism. The authors analyze how client contributions can be assessed in a multi-objective setting, allowing clients to choose clusters based on their incentives. The paper includes theoretical analyses and extensive empirical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of PI-FL across various datasets. Additionally, the authors evaluate the PI-FL algorithm within the context of Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL), addressing the significance of feature shifting. They propose an expanded analysis that includes a 40:60 data partition, demonstrating improved performance of PI-FL compared to other methods under heterogeneous conditions, particularly in non-IID scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper effectively links personalization and incentivization in federated learning, suggesting that incentivization is more achievable when models are personalized.
2. The theoretical analysis is clear and supported by interpretable toy examples.
3. Extensive empirical experiments validate the proposed method's effectiveness, highlighting the superiority of PI-FL in various non-IID datasets.
4. The authors have effectively expanded their evaluation to include a 40:60 partition, showing enhanced performance of PI-FL.
5. The methodology for feature-shift evaluation is well-founded, drawing from prior works in personalized Federated Learning.

Weaknesses:
1. Section 3 lacks concise writing, with many design choices inadequately justified theoretically.
2. The theoretical analysis emphasizes collaboration gains but overlooks the mechanisms that incentivize participation and honest data contribution.
3. Some notations and terms, such as "token" and "reimbursement," are not clearly defined, leading to confusion.
4. The discussion on fairness related to incentives lacks depth, particularly regarding how contributions affect rewards.
5. The paper does not adequately address the potential performance of the 30:70 partition, which remains unexplored.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 3 by providing more concise descriptions and backing design choices with theoretical justifications. Additionally, the authors should define key terms like "token" and "reimbursement" to enhance understanding. It would be beneficial to include a discussion on the convergence of PI-FL and its comparison with other personalized federated learning algorithms regarding convergence speed. Furthermore, we suggest expanding the empirical experiments to include datasets that reflect heterogeneous data distributions, such as those with Dirichlet splitting, to strengthen the paper's claims. We also recommend improving the discussion on fairness by incorporating collaborative fairness measures rather than relying solely on the "opt-out" indicator. Lastly, the authors should investigate and include results for the 30:70 partition in the revised paper to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of their method.
