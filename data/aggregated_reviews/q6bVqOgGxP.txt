Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the design of budget-feasible mechanisms (BFMs) where a buyer aims to purchase from sellers with private production costs, maximizing total value under a budget constraint. The authors propose a new framework that achieves a good approximation to the first-best solution and low pricing complexity, measured by the number of questions each seller must answer. The paper demonstrates that the new methods outperform existing approaches in influence maximization tasks, with significant improvements in approximation guarantees and query complexity for both monotone and non-monotone submodular functions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The problem is well-established and practically relevant.  
- The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of technical ideas.  
- The proposed framework represents solid progress in the field, potentially triggering further advancements.  
- Significant improvements in approximation ratios and query complexity are achieved.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks discussion on lower bounds, which is partly due to the intrinsic complexity of the BFM problem.  
- There is no empirical evaluation for the non-monotone submodular function case.  
- The presentation of the algorithm could be clearer, making it challenging for readers unfamiliar with the area.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on lower bounds to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the problem's complexity. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the connection to posted pricing mechanisms early in the paper, particularly regarding the statement on line 117. It would also be beneficial to explicitly comment on the tradeoff between queries and solution quality for all three families of methods in the last paragraph of Section 6. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to optimize the current pricing formulation and consider whether querying sellers in order of their values could enhance performance. Lastly, we advise improving the clarity of the algorithm's presentation by adding descriptive lines for the candidate and accepted sets.
