### Key Points
This paper presents a Knowledge-Enhanced Pre-trained Language Model (KEPLM) framework, named KANGAROO, designed for closed-domain tasks. It utilizes hyperbolic embeddings and a robust negative sampling strategy to address local density issues and enhance the training process by capturing implicit graph structures among entities. The authors evaluate their approach on two open datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art results and providing an in-depth ablation study.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and clearly explains the proposed model, which is well-justified and structured.  
- The framework shows superior performance on named entity recognition tasks and offers a comprehensive evaluation, contributing to the understanding of knowledge structures in entity embeddings.  
- The authors provide their code for reproducibility, which is commendable.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks experiments on general domain knowledge graph injection into pre-trained language models.  
- The settings for positive and negative samples are unclear, particularly the rationale for using all first-hop nodes as positive samples and the inclusion of positive samples in negative sampling.  
- The related work section is merely a list without effectively positioning the proposal within current literature, and the limitations of the framework are not adequately discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the positive and negative sample settings in Section 3.2.1, providing a detailed explanation of their motivations and implications on results. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the related work section to better position the proposal within existing literature and explicitly outline the framework's limitations. Furthermore, Section 3.1 could benefit from more details on component interactions to avoid redundancy. Lastly, evaluating the proposed system on additional domains would provide deeper insights into its advantages and challenges.
