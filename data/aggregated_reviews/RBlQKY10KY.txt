### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach by examining the direct influence of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) on the actions of downstream decision-makers, providing valuable insights into the field. The authors propose a decision-driven calibration method aimed at directly optimizing UQ to minimize incurred costs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper offers a strong technical explanation of the underlying concept.
2. The objective is clearly stated and justified.
3. The examples provided are relevant and appropriate for real-world applications.

Weaknesses:
1. Several technical errors need revision, such as correcting the notation on page 2, line 58 from $X = ℝ^d$ to $X ∈ ℝ^d$, and revising "ViT_B_16" to "ViT-B/16" on page 4, line 139.
2. The use of $σ(z)$ for approximating the $argmax$ on page 3, line 96 should include a temperature parameter for better control over the approximation effect.
3. The paper lacks a conclusion section, which is essential for summarizing key findings. Additionally, Figure 1 requires improvement for readability.
4. The paper's clarity is hindered by long, wordy sentences and a lack of clear formatting, particularly in distinguishing the conclusion from the results.
5. The paper is limited in visualizations, which could enhance reader comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the technical accuracy by addressing the noted errors and incorporating a temperature parameter for the approximation. Additionally, the authors should include a conclusion section to summarize key findings and enhance Figure 1 for better readability. To improve clarity, we suggest breaking long sentences into shorter ones and ensuring clear formatting to delineate sections. Finally, we encourage the authors to include more visualizations to aid reader understanding.
