Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Adaptive Long-range aware TransformER (ALTER), a brain graph transformer designed to capture long-range dependencies between brain regions of interest (ROIs) using biased random walk sampling. The authors argue that existing methods inadequately address the complexities of brain-wide communication, and ALTER aims to bridge this gap by integrating both long- and short-range dependencies through a transformer framework. Experimental results indicate that ALTER outperforms state-of-the-art graph learning methods on the ABIDE and ADNI datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper effectively addresses a significant gap in brain network representation learning, emphasizing the importance of long-range dependencies.
2. It is well-written, with clear illustrations and a logical flow that enhances understanding.
3. The experimental results are robust, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method and its superiority over existing approaches.

Weaknesses:
1. Some design choices, such as the use of biased random walk and the introduction of a linear layer, lack sufficient motivation and clarity.
2. The paper does not adequately compare with the latest related works or provide a comprehensive analysis of the results in a neuroscience context.
3. The dataset construction and experimental settings are not clearly defined, raising questions about the reproducibility and validity of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their design choices, particularly regarding the necessity of the biased random walk and the linear layer in the ALTER framework. Additionally, the authors should provide a more thorough comparison with recent related works and include a deeper analysis of the results from a neuroscience perspective, such as identifying specific ROIs relevant to the target diseases. Furthermore, clarifying the dataset construction details and experimental settings will enhance the reproducibility of the study.
