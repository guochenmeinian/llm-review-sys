### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of error-correcting output codes (ECOCs) for multi-class classification, utilizing the neural tangent kernel (NTK) to derive theoretical results that aid in selecting appropriate ECOCs and provide guarantees. The authors propose two ECOC construction methods: one based on Hadamard codes and another through direct optimization. They establish a perturbation bound for DNN outputs under weight noise, indicating a shift from one-hot coding to alternative ECOCs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The theoretical analysis is a strong aspect, revealing that replacing one-hot codes with other ECOCs changes the decoding metric from Euclidean to Mahalanobis distance.
- The authors provide an upper bound for perturbation, aiding in the selection of minimal ECOC distances.
- The manuscript is well-written, and the experimental results demonstrate a performance advantage over existing methods.

Weaknesses:
- The main contribution is reiterated multiple times, leading to redundancy.
- An explicit problem statement and formal definition of the weight-error model are lacking.
- Corollary 1 appears trivial and follows directly from coding theory.
- The relationship between correlation matrices and performance is inadequately explained.
- The presentation contains grammatical errors and undefined parameters.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their problem statement and explicitly define the weight-error model. Additionally, consider reducing redundancy in presenting the main contributions. We suggest providing a more thorough discussion of the limitations of the method beyond hardware acceleration. To enhance the theoretical foundation, please clarify the relationship between correlation matrices and performance, and ensure all parameters are defined in the main text. Lastly, consider revising the title to better reflect the paper's focus, as NTK is not the primary topic.
