Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the STONE framework, a scalable tensor-based multi-view subspace clustering model that addresses high computational complexity, inaccurate subspace representation, and inadequate penalization of noise-related singular values. The authors propose enhancements in anchor dictionary learning, anchor hypergraph Laplacian regularization, and an improved hyperbolic tangent function for tensor rank approximation. Experimental results indicate that STONE outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in both effectiveness and efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The method explores rich information in multi-view data, enhancing clustering performance and offering a novel perspective in multi-view clustering research.
2. It achieves optimal clustering performance while maintaining high computational efficiency, ensuring scalability.
3. Comprehensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and efficiency.
4. The rigorous theoretical analyses support the validity and reliability of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
1. The introduction of Enhanced Anchor Dictionary (EAD) lacks clarity; the authors should clarify its differences from traditional dictionary learning and how it incorporates hidden data.
2. There are typographical errors and inconsistencies in figure and equation references that need correction.
3. The performance correlation with the number of anchor points is unclear; the authors should explain why it does not exhibit a linear positive correlation.
4. The pseudocode for Algorithm 1 has mismatched formula indices with the main manuscript.
5. The model's complexity is high due to numerous parameters; the authors should optimize the model rather than simply adding constraints.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the Enhanced Anchor Dictionary (EAD) by elaborating on its differences from traditional dictionary learning and its methodology for incorporating hidden data. Additionally, please correct typographical errors and ensure consistency in figure and equation references throughout the manuscript. We suggest providing a clearer explanation for the observed performance correlation with the number of anchor points. Furthermore, please ensure that the pseudocode for Algorithm 1 aligns with the main manuscript. Lastly, we encourage the authors to optimize the model to reduce the number of parameters and improve overall efficiency.
