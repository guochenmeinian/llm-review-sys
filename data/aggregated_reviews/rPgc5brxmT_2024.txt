Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel gradient flow geometry termed interaction-force transport (IFT), based on the inf-convolution of the Wasserstein and maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) metric tensors. The authors provide theoretical results demonstrating global exponential convergence for both MMD and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence energies. They introduce a particle gradient descent algorithm for IFT, validated through two proof-of-concept examples involving 2D Gaussian distributions and a moderate-dimensional experiment (d=100) using a mixture of three Gaussians as a target, including comparisons with some requested approaches. However, the authors note that the practical implementation of KL energy with the proposed IFT flow is beyond the scope of the paper, which may lead to confusion.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and organized, with a thorough literature review and consistent notation.
2. It makes a significant theoretical contribution to machine/statistical learning, appealing to a broad audience.
3. The implementation of the proposed gradient flows is clear and reproducible.
4. The originality of the work is notable, particularly in defining new gradient flows and proving global convergence for MMD and KL energies.
5. The authors conducted a moderate-dimensional experiment and included comparisons with requested approaches, acknowledging the intention to propose a new IFT "gradient structure" as a significant contribution.

Weaknesses:
1. The manuscript's readability is hindered by complex mathematical terminology, particularly in section 2, which could be simplified or supplemented with theoretical introductions.
2. The structure of the text is questionable, with some remarks and corollaries placed inappropriately relative to the main theorems.
3. The practical validation is limited to low-dimensional experiments, raising concerns about scalability and the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to alternatives.
4. The theoretical results, particularly for MMD, may not be as impactful as claimed, given existing literature on similar convergence properties.
5. There is a lack of visualizations for results, particularly for dimensions greater than 2.
6. The scope of the paper may be unclear due to the inclusion of KL energy implementation discussions, and the theoretical results may not be sufficiently solid for publication based on limited experimental evaluation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the accessibility of the manuscript by simplifying complex mathematical terms or providing necessary theoretical introductions in an appendix. Additionally, we suggest restructuring the text for better clarity, particularly by repositioning remarks and corollaries for logical flow. To enhance practical validation, the authors should include experiments in higher dimensions and compare their method against flows using KL divergence energy. We also recommend that the authors clarify the limitations regarding the practical implementation of KL energy within the paper. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide figures to visualize the results, if feasible, to enhance understanding. Finally, we urge the authors to strengthen the theoretical foundation of their results to address concerns about the robustness of the experiments and to explicitly mention potential issues related to the teleporting of mass in the MMD-IFT flow.
