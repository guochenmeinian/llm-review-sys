### Key Points
This paper presents a method for text-to-motion synthesis that generates interactions among multiple people using a zero-shot approach. The authors propose a framework that utilizes a large language model (LLM) to create motion instructions and identify joint pairs for contact or avoidance. The method consists of a two-stage process involving a planner and a diffusion model, specifically the Motion ControlNet, which incorporates inverse kinematics (IK) for fine control over joint movements. The authors demonstrate that their approach can effectively generate human interactions without requiring multi-person motion datasets, achieving improvements over existing models like priorMDM in both quantitative and qualitative assessments. The authors argue that their method's generalization ability is advantageous, despite the inherent challenges of zero-shot techniques compared to fully-supervised methods. They highlight their IK-guidance and non-root joint control as key innovations over OmniControl, asserting that their approach allows for faster inference and better joint alignment.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant challenge in human interaction generation, leveraging single-person datasets to produce multi-person interactions.
- The joint-pair distance representation simplifies the modeling of interactions, and the IK guidance proves effective.
- The proposed method demonstrates effective zero-shot interaction generation capabilities.
- IK-guidance is a notable innovation that improves optimization speed and joint alignment.
- The manuscript is well-structured and easy to follow, with a comprehensive related work section.
- The authors provide extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing methods, enhancing the paper's credibility.

Weaknesses:
- The method section lacks clarity, particularly in explaining the generation of contact joint pairs and the discrepancies between relative and global motion.
- There are instances of severe human collisions in generated interactions, indicating that the joint pair contact types may not be sufficiently detailed.
- The iterative IK guidance optimization may lead to inefficiencies, suggesting a need for alternative optimization strategies.
- Comparisons with InterGen are deemed unfair due to the differing methodologies.
- Qualitative results exhibit abrupt velocity changes, suggesting potential issues with motion naturalness.
- Clarity issues in the method section, particularly regarding the application of IK guidance and the use of $\mu$ versus $x_0$.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method section by providing an overview of the architecture and elaborating on the discrepancies between relative and global motion. Additionally, the authors should clarify how contact joint pairs are generated by the LLM and address the observed collisions in generated motions by refining spatial control over body roots. To enhance efficiency, consider implementing a direct optimization approach similar to DNO or a single-step post-optimization. Furthermore, including a discussion on the limitations of LLM plans and the Inter-X dataset, along with comparing results with methods like InterGen, would strengthen the paper's contributions. Lastly, we suggest improving the visualization of contact plans and incorporating mesh-based representations for better interpretability of interactions, as well as revising the wording around IK guidance to accurately reflect its distinction from classifier guidance.
