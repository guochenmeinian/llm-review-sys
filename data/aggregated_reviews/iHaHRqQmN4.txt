### Key Points
This paper presents EASING, the first semi-supervised framework for node importance estimation in heterogeneous graphs, which significantly contributes to the integration of semi-supervised learning with graph node importance estimation. The authors propose a Distribution-based Joint Estimator (DJE) that uniquely combines a multidimensional Gaussian distribution for uncertainty modeling with an encoder-decoder design, facilitating joint estimation of importance and uncertainty. The framework enhances accuracy by generating pseudo-labels for unlabeled data, demonstrating substantial performance improvements over existing methods across three real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of EASING as a novel semi-supervised framework for node importance estimation is a pioneering contribution.
- The DJE architecture effectively integrates uncertainty modeling, improving learning quality from partially labeled data.
- Comprehensive experiments provide substantial empirical evidence of EASING's superior performance, with statistically significant improvements in Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Square Error.

Weaknesses:
- Some experimental settings lack clarity, particularly regarding dataset splits and details.
- The coherence of formula descriptions in the methods section is inconsistent, requiring readers to infer meanings.
- The framework is limited to static graphs, and the potential for extension to dynamic graphs remains unexplored.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of experimental settings, including dataset splits and detailed descriptions of the methods. Additionally, the authors should enhance the coherence of formula descriptions to avoid confusion. It would be beneficial to justify the choice of multidimensional elliptical Gaussian distributions and discuss the implications of using alternative distributions. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors provide a detailed analysis of the ratio of nodes with pseudo-labels among all unlabeled nodes and consider including performance metrics for labeled nodes to reflect DJEâ€™s effectiveness. Lastly, addressing the computational overhead by reporting training and inference times would provide a clearer evaluation of the method's efficiency.
