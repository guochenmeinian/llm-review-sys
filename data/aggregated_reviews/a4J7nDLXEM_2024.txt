### Key Points
This paper presents a novel metric called "compression ratio" to evaluate the effectiveness of PCA in denoising and outlier detection. The authors demonstrate that this metric captures the impact of PCA on high-dimensional data, particularly in community-structured datasets, where outliers exhibit a flatter distribution of compression ratios compared to inliers. The authors validate their approach through theoretical proofs and extensive experiments on real-world single-cell RNA-seq data, showing its superiority over existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a significant question regarding the characterization of PCA's impact on denoising and clustering.
2. The theoretical proofs are solid and well-founded.
3. The experimental results are rich and convincingly validate the theoretical analysis.

Weaknesses:
1. The experiments are limited to single-cell RNA-seq data, which may not be generalizable; results on additional datasets are necessary.
2. The assumptions made, particularly regarding the number of outliers and noise distribution, may not hold in practical scenarios.
3. The outlier detection algorithm's reliance on PCA, which is not robust to outliers, raises concerns about the reliability of the compression ratios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by conducting experiments on a broader range of datasets beyond single-cell RNA-seq. Additionally, we encourage the authors to include more robustness and sensitivity analyses to assess the applicability of the compression ratio metric. Clarifying the relationship between the compression ratio and variance explained in PCA would also enhance the paper. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors provide more simulation results with higher dimensionality and compare their method against established robust PCA techniques, such as IF-HCT-PCA, to better contextualize their contributions.
