Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel algorithm called Score Distillation via Inversion (SDI) that enhances the quality of 3D shape generation by inverting Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) at each step. By incorporating the initial noise into the estimated score, SDI addresses over-smoothing and detail loss issues prevalent in traditional Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) methods. Experimental results indicate that SDI significantly improves 3D shape quality, closely matching 2D image generation quality without requiring additional neural network training or multi-view supervision. The work provides valuable insights into 3D asset generation with diffusion models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper offers a theoretical analysis linking SDS with DDIM, enhancing understanding of discrepancies between 2D and 3D generation processes, unlike previous experimental enhancements.
2. The modification to SDS is straightforward, requiring no additional network training or multi-view supervision, and significantly improves 3D shape generation quality.
3. The paper includes thorough analysis and convincing ablation experiments.

Weaknesses:
1. The authors' hypothesis suggests that better estimation of the noise term in Eq. (8) leads to improved 3D generation quality; however, ablation studies on the choice of k(x) show no significant improvement, as evidenced by Figure 10. Explanations for this phenomenon would be appreciated.
2. The claim that SDS introduces high variance is noted, yet another paper focused on minimizing this variance could provide a valuable comparison.
3. The rationale behind inversion with negative guidance is unclear and warrants further investigation and justification.
4. The similarity of using DDIM inversion to ISM requires a thorough discussion and detailed comparisons.
5. The reliance on CLIP-IQA for quantitative evaluation may not be suitable for 3D generation; a user study or recent automated evaluation metrics should be considered.
6. The quantitative results lack NFSD, and qualitative comparisons are limited to two prompts; additional visual comparisons and diversity evaluations under different prompts would be beneficial.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanations regarding the lack of significant improvement in the ablation studies related to the noise term estimation. Additionally, a comparison with the work focused on minimizing variance in SDS would strengthen the paper. A more detailed investigation into the rationale for negative guidance in inversion is necessary. We suggest that the authors provide a thorough discussion comparing their method with ISM, highlighting key differences. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to consider alternative evaluation methods beyond CLIP-IQA, such as user studies or recent automated metrics, and to include NFSD in quantitative results along with more visual comparisons and evaluations of diversity under different prompts.
