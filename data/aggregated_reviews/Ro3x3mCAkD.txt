### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for text classification, demonstrating their efficiency and effectiveness compared to traditional methods. The authors conduct an extensive analysis using three types of convolutional layers across 12 GNN architectures, including pre-trained word embeddings as node features. They also incorporate two transformer-based large language models for comparative analysis. The findings indicate that simple graph constructions yield better performance with longer documents, highlighting the advantages of graph representations over Transformer-based models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Comprehensive analysis of GNNs for text classification, covering various architectures and message-passing strategies.
- Systematic comparison with mainstream text classification methods, providing valuable insights into GNN applicability.

Weaknesses:
- Lack of clarity regarding the motivation and original contributions of the research.
- Insufficient justification for the choice of the 'bert-uncased-base' model without exploring potentially superior alternatives.
- Limited performance evaluations across different text datasets raise concerns about resource utilization and generalizability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the research motivation and explicitly state their unique contributions to the field. Additionally, the authors should justify the exclusive use of the 'bert-uncased-base' model and consider evaluating other pre-trained models. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to conduct more extensive performance evaluations on various text datasets to address potential resource utilization issues. Lastly, the authors should provide a clearer rationale for the benefits of structural information captured by GNNs in specific text classification tasks, such as sentiment analysis.
