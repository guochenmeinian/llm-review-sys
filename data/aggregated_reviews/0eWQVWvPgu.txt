### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the impact of argument pattern on persuasiveness in online discussions, focusing on the interactive relationship between arguments, which has been overlooked in existing research. The authors propose using argumentative discourse unit (ADU) patterns to capture discussion structures, fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM for ADU classification and employing two clustering approaches, Edits and embeddings based. They analyze the collected data for ADU type distribution and cluster statistics, incorporating argument structure features into an LSTM model to predict persuasiveness, comparing it against length-based and BERT-based baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an interesting problem and the method for capturing argument structure is well-motivated.
- The analysis of ADU types and their roles is intriguing and can be further emphasized.
- The identified patterns provide an interpretable approach for predicting persuasiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The interactive relationship between arguments has been previously studied, and the paper lacks comparisons with existing approaches.
- The quality verification of the model is ad-hoc, relying on a different dataset without clear justification for the new dataset's creation.
- The models used, such as BERT, are considered weak compared to more recent alternatives, potentially affecting visibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with existing approaches to better contextualize their contributions. Additionally, exploring more recent models for persuasiveness prediction could strengthen the paper. The authors should clarify the benefits of creating a new CMV dataset and consider using frequent pattern mining algorithms for identifying patterns with exact sequences of ADUs. Finally, addressing the uneven cluster sizes and providing metrics for cluster quality would enhance the robustness of their findings.
