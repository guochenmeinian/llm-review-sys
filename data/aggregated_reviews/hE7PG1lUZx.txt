Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel loss function, USS (Unified Sample-to-Sample loss), aimed at enhancing face recognition by learning a unified threshold for distinguishing positive and negative pairs. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of UniTSFace, which integrates USS with existing margin-based softmax losses like ArcFace and CosFace, across various benchmark datasets, achieving significant performance improvements.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper clearly shows performance gains using UniTSFace across multiple datasets.
- The derivation of the USS loss from a contrastive objective is compelling.
- The concept of learning a unified threshold applicable across different datasets is innovative.

Weaknesses:
- The necessity of learning the threshold \( t \) is not convincingly established; it remains unclear if performance improvements stem from making \( t \) a learnable parameter or from the supervised contrastive learning objective.
- The learned threshold's superiority over traditional methods, which calculate optimal thresholds specific to validation datasets, is not demonstrated.
- Figure 1 indicates that despite using the USS loss, threshold variance persists, suggesting that calibrating different thresholds for different datasets may be more effective.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the term "unified" in the context of the learned threshold, particularly in the introduction. Additionally, the authors should provide a more thorough comparison of UniTSFace with ArcFace combined with Supervised Contrastive Loss and ArcFace with \( L_{\text{naive}} \). It would also be beneficial to discuss the necessity of the unified threshold more explicitly, providing empirical evidence to support its advantages over traditional methods. Lastly, we suggest simplifying complex symbolic formulas used to express basic concepts, particularly in lines 105 to 124, to enhance readability.
