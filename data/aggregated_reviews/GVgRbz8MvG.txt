Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to the noisy Independent Component Analysis (ICA) problem by introducing a nonparametric independence score that evaluates the estimation of demixing matrices without prior knowledge of noise distribution parameters. The authors propose new contrast functions and a meta-algorithm to select the best ICA solutions from various candidates, supported by numerical experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of their methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a nonparametric independence score is innovative and theoretically justified.
- The paper includes a solid review of relevant studies on ICA and noisy ICA.
- Experimental results encompass both synthetically generated sources and real data, demonstrating the proposed methods' effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The focus is primarily on recovering the unmixing matrix (B^{-1}), with insufficient discussion on how to recover the clean sources afterward.
- The experimental section is limited to synthetically mixed signals, lacking real-world source separation examples.
- The reliance on Gaussian noise assumptions raises concerns about the generalizability of the results to other noise types.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the connection between the meta-algorithm and the new contrast functions, as well as provide more detail on the development of the meta-algorithm and the rationale behind the choice of randomization. Additionally, we suggest including real-world examples in the experimental section to enhance the applicability of the findings. The authors should also address the strong assumptions made in Theorem 2 regarding sub-Gaussian mixtures and explore the implications if these assumptions are not met. Furthermore, we recommend clarifying the origin and motivation for the new contrast functions, as well as ensuring consistent notation and correcting typographical errors throughout the manuscript.
