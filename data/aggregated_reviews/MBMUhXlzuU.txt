### Key Points
This paper presents an approach to Discontinuous Named Entity Recognition (DNER) through the TriG-NER framework, which utilizes a token-level triplet loss to enhance the representation of entities that may be dispersed across non-adjacent tokens. The authors evaluate TriG-NER against various baselines across multiple datasets, demonstrating consistent performance improvements. The architecture involves encoding words, constructing a word pair relationship grid, and applying a grid tagging and decoding scheme to classify relationships among word pairs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem addressed is both interesting and challenging.
- The approach is original and contributes novel insights to the field.
- The paper is well-written and clear, with effective illustrations.
- Comprehensive evaluation, including experiments with large language models like GPT-4 and Gemini.

Weaknesses:
- The advantages of TriG-NER over existing grid-based architectures are not thoroughly explained.
- There is a lack of code and data availability for reproducibility.
- The paper does not provide comparison results with models like GPT-4, Gemini, or Llama 3.
- The improvements over other approaches appear marginal, and the impact of different random initializations is not analyzed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the advantages of TriG-NER compared to existing methods. Additionally, please provide the code and datasets used for the experiments to facilitate reproducibility. It would be beneficial to include comparison results with models such as GPT-4, Gemini, and Llama 3 to contextualize the performance of TriG-NER. We also suggest conducting multiple runs of experiments to analyze the impact of random initializations and provide standard deviations. Lastly, consider incorporating a running example from the beginning to enhance understanding of the model's functionality.
