### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive study on the security risks posed by browser extensions, particularly their access to password fields. The authors develop a proof-of-concept (PoC) extension that successfully bypasses Google's Manifest V3 policy and is approved by the Chrome Web Store. They analyze login pages of the top 10,000 domains and identify vulnerabilities, including 1,100 websites exhibiting Plaintext Visible vulnerabilities. The authors also conduct static and dynamic analyses of 160,000 extensions, identifying 190 that access password fields. They propose an LLM-driven framework, Extension Reviewer, to enhance detection of malicious extensions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Extensive analysis of browser extensions revealing vulnerabilities that may leak sensitive information.
- Development of a novel hybrid malicious browser extension that highlights weaknesses in the Web Store review process.
- Introduction of the LLM-based extension reviewer and potential solutions to address identified vulnerabilities.

Weaknesses:
- Insufficient technical details regarding static and dynamic analysis methodologies.
- Lack of comparison between the proposed LLM-based reviewer and existing methods.
- Ethical concerns regarding the submission of a PoC extension to the Chrome Web Store, potentially wasting human testers' time.
- Unclear threat model assumptions and the implications of Plaintext Visible vulnerabilities.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and detail of the static and dynamic analysis methodologies. Additionally, the authors should provide a more fine-grained characterization of the measurement study results and explicitly compare the performance of the LLM-based extension reviewer against existing baselines. It would be beneficial to articulate the conceptual distinctions between their method and prior research, as well as address the ethical implications of their PoC extension more thoroughly. Finally, we suggest the authors finalize the related works section to include missing citations and clarify the novelty of their contributions in relation to existing literature.
