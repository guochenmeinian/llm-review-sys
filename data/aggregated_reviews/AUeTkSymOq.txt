Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Freya PAGE method, a novel parallel optimization technique for non-convex finite-sum problems in heterogeneous and asynchronous computational environments. The authors provide theoretical analysis, including iteration and time complexity bounds, and establish a lower bound for time complexity in such settings. The method effectively addresses the challenge of stragglers by adaptively ignoring slower computations, making it suitable for large-scale machine learning tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents a significant advancement in handling heterogeneous and asynchronous computational environments.
- Freya PAGE achieves optimal time complexity under weaker assumptions compared to existing methods like Asynchronous SGD.
- The theoretical framework is robust, with innovative gradient collection strategies and a strong presentation of the subject.

Weaknesses:
- The determination of optimal parameters $S$ and $p$ as outlined in Theorem 7 is challenging due to the need for knowledge of unknown $\tau_i$.
- The empirical results are primarily limited to synthetic tasks, lacking extensive experimentation on diverse real-world datasets.
- The algorithm does not address non-iid data scenarios, which may limit its applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical validation by including diverse and extensive experiments on a wider range of real-world datasets and applications. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the mechanism by which Freya PAGE determines which computations to ignore in the presence of stragglers, as well as addressing the impact of communication overhead due to individual gradient messages. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide more details on the choice of inverse proportion to $\tau_i$ and clarify the assumptions regarding Theorem 4 and its relation to finite $\tau_i$.
