### Key Points
This paper presents a novel planner that merges a data-driven planner, Plansformer (System 1), with a traditional planner like LPG or FD (System 2). The approach employs System 1 to generate a plan, while a metacognitive system assesses the plan's confidence score. If the score is low, the system resorts to System 2 for plan formulation. The proposed Plan-SOFAI architecture, inspired by Kahneman's "Thinking, Fast and Slow," aims to address various planning problems by integrating fast and slow planning approaches and incorporating a metacognitive process.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Combines fast and slow thinking approaches effectively.
- Demonstrates a seamless integration of symbolic and end-to-end Machine Learning techniques.
- Shows promise in addressing real-world planning problems and maintains a good balance in solving plan optimality.

Weaknesses:
- Lack of motivating examples to support the proposed approach.
- The execution of neural and logical reasoning in a fallback manner may not be optimal; a parallel voting-based technique could be more effective.
- The paper postpones the investigation of Plansformer optimization, potentially limiting system effectiveness.
- Testing scenarios may not fully capture the diversity of real-world applications, raising concerns about the architecture's effectiveness in new or significantly different scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the table by splitting it into two, with techniques as rows and metrics as columns. Additionally, we suggest providing motivating examples to better illustrate the proposed approach and exploring the feasibility of executing neural and logical reasoning in parallel. Finally, we encourage the authors to investigate the optimization of Plansformer and expand testing across a broader range of scenarios to assess the architecture's effectiveness comprehensively.
