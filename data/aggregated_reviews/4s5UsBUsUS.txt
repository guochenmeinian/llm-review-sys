Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel video frame interpolation (VFI) method called VFIMamba, which integrates the S6 model with VFI architectures, leveraging linear computational complexity and global receptive fields. The authors propose a token rearrangement strategy and a curriculum learning approach to enhance the model's performance across varying motion magnitudes. Experimental results demonstrate that VFIMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets, particularly for high-resolution frames.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is the first to adapt the S6 model to VFI, showcasing originality and innovation.
- VFIMamba achieves competitive performance with efficient FLOPs, particularly in high-resolution scenarios.
- The methodology is clearly articulated, with thorough experiments and ablation studies validating the proposed strategies.

Weaknesses:
- The accuracy of interpolation results could be better demonstrated through visual error maps.
- The paper lacks clarity on how frames at arbitrary time steps are computed for 8x interpolation, and important details are relegated to the appendix.
- There is insufficient information on the scaling of FLOPs with resolution, and missing citations of relevant methods in the field.
- The model does not meet real-time application requirements, and the performance gap on low-resolution datasets needs further analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the visualization of interpolation accuracy by including error maps. Additionally, please clarify the computation of frames for 8x interpolation in the main text and provide a comparison of FLOPs across different models in relation to input resolution. It would be beneficial to include details on the training datasets used for comparison in Tables 2 and 3, and to discuss potential strategies for enhancing inference speed to meet real-time requirements. Finally, consider adding citations for recent methods relevant to high-resolution VFI to strengthen the literature review.
