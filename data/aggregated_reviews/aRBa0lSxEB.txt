### Key Points
This paper presents a general framework for studying the convergence of last-iterate, noisy, and possibly biased Langevin-like discrete time approximations to the continuous Langevin flow for sampling from a distribution. The authors offer theoretical guarantees on the convergence of a broad class of sampling methods to the stationary distribution in non-convex settings. The analysis builds upon constructing a continuous-time trajectory via interpolating the iterates and checking stability conditions using dynamical system theory. The framework encompasses various sampling schemes, including Euler discretization, mirror Langevin, proximal, randomized mid-point, and Runge-Kutta methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well-written and provides a unified analysis of convergence results for a wide range of Langevin-type algorithms. It employs a novel proof technique that distinguishes it from existing research, enhancing its originality. The writing quality is exceptional, making the paper accessible to a broad audience.

Weaknesses:  
The most interesting part of the framework, the two-line proof of Theorem 2, is relegated to the appendix, which detracts from its visibility. The work is purely asymptotic, lacking rates of convergence, and the practical implications of the results are unclear. Additionally, some claims regarding existing literature are inaccurate, and the discussion of limitations is insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the visibility of the two-line proof of Theorem 2 by including it in the main body of the paper and clarifying the theorem of [6] being invoked, along with its conditions. We suggest that the authors explore relaxing the condition of convergence at very large times to obtain bounds on the Wasserstein distance for a finite number of steps. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide more quantitative guarantees beyond asymptotic convergence and to clarify the practical relevance of their results. Lastly, we advise addressing inaccuracies in the discussion of existing literature and improving the clarity of notations used throughout the paper.
