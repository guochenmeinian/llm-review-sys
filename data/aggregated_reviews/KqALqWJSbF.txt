### Key Points
This paper presents VinePPO, a novel approach that replaces the value network in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with Monte Carlo rollouts for improved credit assignment in large language models (LLMs). The authors demonstrate that VinePPO outperforms standard PPO in math reasoning tasks, addressing the limitations of classical PPO in estimating intermediate state values.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-motivated, with empirical experiments supporting the claim that the value network in PPO provides inaccurate estimates.
- The use of Monte Carlo rollouts is innovative and effectively leverages the unique characteristics of language environments, leading to significant performance improvements.
- The writing is clear, and the empirical analysis is thorough, with detailed illustrations and hyper-parameter tuning processes.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks theoretical insights into why the value network fails in credit assignment and does not provide sufficient justification for the superiority of VinePPO over classical PPO.
- There is a need for more extensive comparisons with other baseline policy optimization algorithms and fine-tuning strategies to enhance the paper's credibility.
- Some figures, such as Figure 3, lack clarity, making it challenging to interpret their significance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical explanation of why classical PPO leads to high bias and provide empirical justifications for the advantages of VinePPO. Additionally, we suggest including more comparisons with other fine-tuning strategies and baseline algorithms, such as GRPO, to strengthen the paper's claims. Clarifying the explanation of Figure 3 would also enhance reader understanding.
