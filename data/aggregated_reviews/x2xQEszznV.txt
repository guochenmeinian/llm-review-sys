Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an online constrained meta-learning framework designed for continuous learning from sequential tasks while adhering to strict constraints. The authors propose an algorithm that utilizes Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) to handle a non-convex meta-objective function, providing theoretical upper bounds on optimality gaps and constraint violations. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through experiments in meta-imitation learning and few-shot image classification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a detailed theoretical analysis in the constrained setting, including upper bounds on regret and constraint violations.
- It introduces a novel approach to online constrained meta-learning, which is rarely addressed in existing literature.
- The empirical results demonstrate strong performance across various benchmarks.

Weaknesses:
- The relationship of the proposed algorithm to prior work is inadequately discussed, particularly in distinguishing it from existing optimization-based meta-learning algorithms.
- The setup of tasks in the applications is not clearly described, especially regarding how the benchmarks adapt to the online setting.
- The algorithm appears to take longer to adapt to new tasks than claimed, as evidenced by experimental results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the relationship between their proposed algorithm and existing methods by providing a more thorough discussion in the related works section. Additionally, the authors should clarify the task setup in the robust few-shot classification benchmarks, specifying the number of tasks used for training and testing. It would also be beneficial to include comparisons with other meta-regularization algorithm baselines, such as iMAML, to enhance the benchmarking fairness. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors address the limitations of their approach, particularly regarding its computational cost compared to online MAML. Lastly, providing practical examples of applications where the constrained setting is beneficial would strengthen the motivation for their framework.
