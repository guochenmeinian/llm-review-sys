Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a bi-level signature scheme called Bileve, designed to enhance the detectability of watermarked texts and mitigate spoofing attacks on large language models (LLMs). The authors propose that Bileve can recognize five detection scenarios, improving upon previous methods that only identified two. The effectiveness of Bileve against spoofing attacks is validated through experiments, demonstrating its ability to trace the provenance of texts generated by LLMs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper clearly lists three types of spoofing attacks and explains the exploited vulnerabilities, providing a reasonable motivation for the research.
2. A comparison between single-level signatures and Bileve aids in understanding the advancements made.
3. The ability of Bileve to produce five different detection results aligns well with real-world applications.

Weaknesses:
1. Despite improvements in text quality with the proposed watermarking approach (WRA), the difference between Bileve and unigram remains noticeable.
2. The global alignment test may fail to produce a small p-value when watermarked text is inserted into a long document, raising concerns about detection accuracy.
3. The generalizability of Bileve to other models is uncertain, as experiments primarily focus on OPT-1.3B and LLaMA-7B.
4. The paper lacks rigorous theoretical guarantees that Bileve effectively mitigates spoofing attacks, and the significance of the spoofing attack itself is questioned.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper, particularly regarding the definition of "signature preservation attack" and the conditions under which Bileve operates. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide more information on the complexity of the generation and detection processes. It would be beneficial to test the Bileve scheme with larger or more powerful LLMs and to report TPR scores at fixed low FPR (FPR = 10% or 1%). Furthermore, we encourage the authors to evaluate the detectability of Bileve with higher rates of token modification, such as 20% or 30%, and to include qualitative evaluations of text quality to better understand the implications of their findings.
