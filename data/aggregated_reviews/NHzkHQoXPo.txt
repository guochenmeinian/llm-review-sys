### Key Points
This paper analyzes users active in four political subreddits (r/Conservative, r/The_Donald, r/ChapoTrapHouse, r/SandersForPresident) who also engage in r/changemyview (CMV). It examines their language use, social rewards, and punishments within their communities, finding that (a) their posts are more personable and less hostile, (b) they receive fewer social rewards (upvotes), and (c) they experience less social punishment (downvotes) that would drive them out of their home communities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- The research questions are relevant, well-posed, and interesting.
- The careful selection and application of statistical methods enhance the analysis.
- The use of real large-scale data is commendable.

Weaknesses:
- The analysis conflates users who post and those who comment in CMV, which may yield different insights; a separate analysis of these groups is warranted.
- The interpretation of results is lacking; effect sizes are reported without substantive context.
- The statistical treatment, while thorough, sometimes obscures the communication of results' implications.
- User matching criteria are not well-justified, and the significance of matching differences is not adequately tested.
- The analysis of downvotes in Section 6 is overly complex and could benefit from simpler, more interpretable methods.
- Key affirmations lack sufficient evidence and clarity, particularly regarding the definition of political subreddits and the rationale for using NER.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and justification of user matching criteria, including the rationale behind chosen characteristics and their limitations. Additionally, we suggest that the authors analyze users who post and comment in CMV separately to explore potential differences in behavior and engagement. The interpretation of results should be deepened, particularly regarding the implications of small effect sizes. We encourage the authors to enhance the organization and clarity of the results presentation, avoiding excessive use of acronyms and ensuring that all results are adequately discussed. Finally, we advise a more thorough exploration of the unexpected use of less analytic language by CMV participants, providing examples and context to support their findings.
