Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the robustness of neural machine translation (NMT) metrics, specifically BERTScore, BLEURT, and COMET, against adversarial attacks. The authors conclude that these metrics tend to over-penalize adversarially degraded translations and exhibit inconsistencies in evaluations across different sentences. The study employs various adversarial attack methods on a German-English translation dataset, aiming to enhance the understanding of metric robustness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant issue regarding the robustness of NMT metrics and provides comprehensive analyses of three prevalent metrics.
- The findings are insightful and may inspire future research aimed at improving the robustness of these metrics.
- The experimental design, particularly the human evaluation, is solid and well-executed.

Weaknesses:
- There are inaccuracies in the results presented, particularly in Figure 1(b), and the writing lacks clarity in some sections, making it difficult to follow.
- The analyses are limited to the German-English language pair, which diminishes the generalizability of the findings.
- The novelty of the work is questioned, as it appears incremental compared to prior research on MT metric robustness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their writing, particularly in the descriptions of methods and results. Additionally, addressing the inaccuracies in Figure 1(b) and providing a standardization term for sentence length in evaluations would enhance the robustness of their findings. Expanding the analysis to include more language pairs and domains would strengthen the paper's contributions. Lastly, we suggest that the authors provide stronger evidence for their claims regarding over-penalization and clarify the unique contributions of their work compared to existing literature.
