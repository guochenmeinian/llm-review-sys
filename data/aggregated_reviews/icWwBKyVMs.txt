Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new GNN explanation framework that integrates prototype learning with the information bottleneck principle, termed the Prototype-based Graph Information Bottleneck (PGIB). The authors detail the framework and demonstrate its effectiveness through comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets and baselines, providing both qualitative and quantitative analyses of interpretability and performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of the Graph Information Bottleneck based on prototype learning significantly enhances baseline methods.
2. The experiments are extensive, with additional analyses provided in the appendix.
3. The paper is well-organized and clearly written.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty is limited as both the information bottleneck and prototype approaches are previously established, with the authors primarily combining these methods.
2. The number of prototypes per class is a crucial hyperparameter; a hyperparameter analysis should be included.
3. The distinctions between PGIB and ProtGNN are unclear, particularly regarding the impact of applying the GIB strategy in ProtGNN.
4. While GIN is used as a backbone, PGIB should be validated on additional GNN architectures, such as GCN and GraphSage.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty discussion by clearly articulating how their approach advances existing methods. Additionally, please include a hyperparameter analysis for the number of prototypes per class. Clarifying the differences between PGIB and ProtGNN, especially regarding the GIB strategy's effects, is essential. Lastly, we suggest validating PGIB on a broader range of GNN structures to demonstrate its model-agnostic capabilities.
