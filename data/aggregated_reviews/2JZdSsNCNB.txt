### Key Points
This paper presents the Hellinger-UCB algorithm, which introduces the Hellinger distance as a novel metric for constructing an upper confidence bound, showcasing significant theoretical innovation. The authors propose that the algorithm performs well in real-world recommendation systems, particularly addressing the cold-start problem, indicating strong potential for practical applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- High level of innovation with the introduction of the Hellinger distance.  
- Promising experimental results suggest effectiveness in real-world applications.

Weaknesses:  
- Lack of rigor in theoretical analysis, particularly in the proof of Theorem 3.1, where crucial assumptions are inadequately detailed.  
- Inadequate experimental design with insufficient justification for dataset choice and conditions, raising concerns about generalizability.  
- Insufficient comparison with existing algorithms, notably the absence of advanced multi-armed bandit algorithms like Thompson Sampling.  
- Inconsistent use of mathematical symbols and formulas, hindering clarity and reproducibility.  
- Limited discussion of practical applications, lacking in-depth analysis of challenges and adaptability in real-world scenarios.  
- Simplistic presentation of experimental results, relying on a single figure without key metrics like computation time.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the rigor of the theoretical analysis by providing detailed proofs and clarifying key assumptions. The experimental design should be enhanced by justifying dataset choices and conditions to better assess generalizability. We suggest including comparisons with advanced multi-armed bandit algorithms, such as Thompson Sampling, and discussing parameter settings used in experiments. The authors should ensure consistent use of mathematical symbols and provide clear definitions for all variables introduced. A more thorough discussion of practical applications and challenges faced in real-world scenarios is necessary. Finally, we advise improving the presentation of experimental results by including additional metrics beyond click-through rates to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the algorithm's performance.
