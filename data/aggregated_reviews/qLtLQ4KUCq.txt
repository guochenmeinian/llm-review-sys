Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents GSAAL, a method designed to address three significant challenges in outlier detection: Inlier Assumption (IA), Curse of Dimensionality (CD), and Multiple Views (MV). The authors claim that GSAAL improves upon existing methods by incorporating multiple discriminators and providing theoretical convergence and scalability analyses. The experimental validation includes comparisons with classical methods and demonstrates the proposed method's advantages.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper has a coherent flow and presents a novel approach to simultaneously tackle IA, CD, and MV.  
- It provides strong theoretical and empirical evidence supporting the proposed method's effectiveness.  
- The experimental design is robust, with numerous visual examples enhancing comprehension.  
- The reproducibility is commendable, as open codes are provided.  

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty of the work appears limited, with theoretical derivations closely resembling those of GANs.  
- Empirical results, particularly on real datasets, lack clarity and do not demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods.  
- The manuscript contains numerous abbreviations that are not defined prior to use, and some figures have readability issues, such as small font sizes.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the manuscript by defining all abbreviations upon first use. Additionally, we suggest including a more comprehensive comparison with GAN-based approaches like AnoGAN and EGBAD to clarify the novelty and advantages of GSAAL. The authors should also enhance the presentation of empirical results, particularly those from real datasets, and consider moving these results from the Appendix to the main text for better visibility. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to explain the significance of the claims regarding improvements in IA and CD, and to address the readability issues in figures, particularly the Y-axis in Figure 4 and the font size in Figure 3.
