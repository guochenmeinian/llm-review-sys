### Key Points
This paper presents a framework called BroDroid to evaluate the private browsing modes of mobile browsers based on six privacy rules. The authors analyzed 49 popular mobile browsers, revealing that while the widely used Chrome browser met all privacy criteria, less popular browsers like Samsung Internet Beta, UC Browser, and Yandex Browser exhibited privacy violations. The study highlights the inconsistency in private browsing implementations across mobile browsers and the necessity for improved privacy practices.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The topic of user privacy in online browsers is highly relevant, providing valuable insights into current practices.
- The methodology allows for scalable testing of privacy properties in Android browser apps.
- The findings indicate significant trends, such as privacy issues arising from customization in Chromium-based browsers.

Weaknesses:
- The impact of the findings is unclear, as the paper does not contextualize the number of affected users or browsers.
- The motivation for the selected test criteria is not adequately justified, and the paper lacks consideration of Android-specific research.
- Limitations of the approach are not fully discussed, particularly regarding the local environment used for testing without HTTPS.
- The clarity of the threat model is insufficient, and the paper does not adequately differentiate between local and server-side storage of browsing history.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the contextualization of their findings by providing data on the potential user impact of the privacy violations. Clarifying the justification for the selected test criteria and considering Android-specific research would strengthen the motivation. Additionally, discussing the limitations of the study, particularly regarding the lack of HTTPS, is essential. We suggest splitting the reported violations into two sets based on the 30-second threshold and analyzing them under various time thresholds. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to clarify the differences in internal storage between desktop and mobile browsers and to provide a clearer explanation of the threat model, including potential server-side storage of browsing history. Lastly, we encourage the authors to consider extending BroDroid for iOS browsers and to automate more steps in their research process.
