Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an optimization method for point cloud completion using a 2D diffusion model, specifically leveraging a neural SDF field to ensure that the generated object aligns with the input partial point cloud. The method employs SDS loss to guide the rendering images from a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model. The authors claim that their approach does not require large datasets, unlike previous methods, and achieves state-of-the-art results on the Redwood 3D Scans dataset for out-of-distribution (OOD) objects.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed method's independence from large datasets enhances its practicality.  
- Clear figures and detailed method descriptions facilitate understanding.  
- The motivation for the approach is well-articulated, and the pipeline design is intuitive and effective.  

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty of the method is limited, as it primarily adds a new constraint to existing techniques without significant new insights.  
- The requirement for multiple inputs (depth image, segmented point cloud, etc.) makes the method impractical for real-world applications.  
- The experimental evaluation lacks depth, with insufficient results on popular benchmarks like ShapeNet and limited quantitative data for the KITTI dataset.  
- The ablation study is weak, failing to adequately demonstrate the impact of the SDS loss on OOD data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their contribution by providing more original insights beyond existing methods. Additionally, the authors should consider simplifying the input requirements to enhance practical applicability. We suggest conducting more comprehensive evaluations on widely-used datasets like ShapeNet and including detailed quantitative results for the KITTI dataset. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to strengthen the ablation study to clarify the contributions of various components, particularly the impact of the SDS loss on OOD performance.
