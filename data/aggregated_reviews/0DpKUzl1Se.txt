Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework for uncertainty estimation in Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) by formulating it as a multiple high-dimensional hypothesis testing problem. The authors propose using the adaptable regularized Hotelling's $T^2$ (ARHT) score to classify inputs as out-of-distribution (OOD) based on latent representations generated by sampling the posterior of the weights. Empirical results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on established benchmarks and a medical dataset, supported by a comprehensive ablation study.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The originality of combining BNNs with hypothesis testing is noteworthy, opening new avenues in uncertainty estimation.
- The paper is well-structured, with clear writing and thorough experimental validation, including standard deviations and relevant baselines.
- The ablation studies effectively highlight the contributions of various components within the proposed framework.

Weaknesses:
- The claim that the BNN framework is a novel contribution is misleading, as it is not unique and should be clarified.
- The authors should be more transparent about the significance of their results, as claims of superiority are not consistently supported by statistical significance.
- The paper lacks intuitive explanations for the ARHT score and the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, which may alienate readers without a statistical background.
- There are inconsistencies in notation and minor typographical errors throughout the manuscript.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions by explicitly stating that the BNN framework is not novel. Additionally, they should adjust their claims regarding the performance of their method to accurately reflect statistical significance. To enhance accessibility, we suggest providing intuitive explanations for the ARHT score and the B-H procedure, potentially in supplementary materials. Furthermore, a thorough review for typographical errors and inconsistencies in notation is necessary. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore more realistic OOD benchmarks and a broader range of uncertainty estimation methods for comparison to strengthen their evaluation.
