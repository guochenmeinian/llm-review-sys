### Key Points
This paper presents SimEdge, a novel similarity measure that assesses edge-to-edge relationships in graphs while maintaining transitivity. The authors propose a mutual reinforcement co-recursion framework that integrates both node-to-node and edge-to-edge similarity. The theoretical analysis and extensive experiments validate SimEdge's effectiveness and superiority over existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of a similarity model that effectively evaluates edge-to-edge relationships.
2. The elegant integration of node-to-node and edge-to-edge similarity.
3. Robust theoretical analysis and clear examples enhance understanding.
4. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to existing models.

Weaknesses:
1. SimEdge is more aligned with the graph track than the search track.
2. The citation method in the introduction lacks appropriateness, with excessive references.
3. Some formula layouts are aesthetically unpleasing, affecting readability.
4. The paper does not analyze the sensitivity of damping factors or the time complexity of SimEdge.
5. The experimental section's color scheme is monotonous, hindering result interpretation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the citation method in the introduction by selecting the most representative works. Additionally, enhancing the layout of formulas in the Proposed Model section would improve readability. The authors should analyze the sensitivity of damping factors and include relevant time complexity analysis. Furthermore, we suggest diversifying the color scheme in the experimental section to make results more intuitive.
