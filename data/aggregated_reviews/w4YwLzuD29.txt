### Key Points
This paper presents a methodology for zero-shot entity linking that incorporates entity aspect information, referred to as sub-view information. The authors propose a key view selection framework, KVZEL, which breaks down long entity descriptions into multiple key views, enhancing performance on a dataset across various domains. The method demonstrates improved results compared to baseline approaches, particularly highlighting the importance of the first selected view.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-structured and addresses a significant challenge in the field.
2. The proposed method shows competitive performance and thorough evaluation, outperforming baseline approaches on the Zeshel dataset.

Weaknesses:
1. The approach to clustering sentences based on semantics is not novel, and the authors should discuss how their method differs from existing work.
2. The hard coding of V0 into the entity linking module may not generalize well beyond encyclopedic corpora, raising questions about its applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related work on sentence selection and semantic clustering to clarify how their key view selection method is distinct. Additionally, we suggest exploring multiple solutions for capturing aspect/sub-view information, as this is central to the paper's contributions. Finally, the authors should address how their approach can be adapted for decoder-only models, which are gaining prominence in the field.
