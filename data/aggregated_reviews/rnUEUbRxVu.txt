Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Context-Adaptive Positional Encoding (CAPE), a method designed to enhance the adaptability of Transformer models for long context tasks by dynamically adjusting positional encodings based on input context. CAPE utilizes a two-layer LeakyReLU neural network to parameterize positional biases, allowing for improved performance in length extrapolation compared to previous methods. The authors demonstrate that CAPE outperforms existing methods like Alibi, Kerple, and FIRE in various permutation-variant tasks, achieving statistically significant improvements in intra-length performance. They provide empirical evidence showing that CAPE's performance is closely tied to the baseline methods it adapts, with the potential for degradation if those baselines perform poorly. The authors conduct extensive experiments across various training lengths, datasets, and model sizes, demonstrating that their method maintains good performance on evaluation lengths of 8192 when trained on shorter sequences. They also promise to incorporate additional discussions in the final revision, including model size experiments and context-boundary analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The concept of data-independent positional embeddings is intriguing and has the potential to enhance model performance.  
2. CAPE shows superior performance in permutation-variant tasks, indicating its robustness in handling complex positional information.  
3. The empirical results indicate substantial improvements in length extrapolation, particularly in experiments on Chomsky's hierarchy tasks.  
4. The paper includes comprehensive experimental results, including visualizations of attention patterns and statistical significance, which support the claims made about CAPE's effectiveness.  
5. The authors commit to releasing code for reproducibility and ensuring fair experiment settings.

Weaknesses:  
1. CAPE introduces extra computational overhead, which negatively impacts training and inference efficiency.  
2. The performance of CAPE is heavily dependent on the baseline methods, raising concerns about its robustness in scenarios where those methods fail.  
3. The choice of hyperparameters is crucial for CAPE's performance, and the current experiments are limited to small language models, lacking evaluations on larger models.  
4. Some experimental configurations, such as the absence of explicit residual connections on the bias matrix, are not thoroughly explored, leaving questions about the inductive biases present in the model.  
5. The evaluation protocols and training strategies differ from those of prior works, which may affect direct comparisons.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the training and inference efficiency of CAPE to address the slow speed noted in the reviews. Additionally, conducting experiments on larger language models, such as Llama3-8B, would provide a clearer picture of CAPE's applicability. We encourage the authors to clarify the meaning of "semantically dependent" in the context of summarization tasks and to elaborate on the proposed bias term in Equations (2) and (3) to enhance understanding. Furthermore, we suggest improving the exploration of configurations where only \( f(QK^T, B) \) is used without the residual on \( B \) to better understand the inductive bias implications. It would also be beneficial to provide a more detailed discussion on the differences in evaluation protocols compared to prior works to contextualize the results better. Finally, ensuring that the Figure 5 caption accurately reflects the content will enhance the paper's clarity.
