Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a methodology for Bayesian inference on Gaussian Process Networks (GPNs), focusing on the marginalization of hyperparameters and network structures. The authors propose a computationally efficient approach that employs Metropolis Hastings algorithms, Laplace approximations, and importance sampling to streamline the learning process. The methodology is evaluated through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its potential in causal structure learning. Additionally, the authors discuss the distinction between Bayesian and non-Bayesian analyses within the context of Bayesian networks, aiming to clarify their focus on fully Bayesian analyses and contextualize their work within existing literature.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed methods are standard and well-justified for the context of GPNs, making the paper accessible to readers familiar with Gaussian processes.
- The paper addresses a relevant problem in causal structure learning and demonstrates a solid understanding of the literature.
- The experimental section is well-explained, showcasing the methodology's application on both synthetic and real datasets.
- The authors demonstrate a commitment to clarifying the distinction between Bayesian and non-Bayesian analyses.
- They plan to enrich the manuscript with relevant literature, enhancing its contextual relevance.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution of the paper is not clearly justified, appearing as a combination of existing methods without sufficient novelty.
- The presentation, particularly in Section 3, is unclear and condensed, making it difficult for readers to grasp the rationale behind the approximations.
- There is a lack of comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms, and the efficiency of the proposed method relative to others is not adequately discussed.
- The empirical study is limited, and the robustness of the results to different prior specifications remains unclear.
- The inability to revise the manuscript during the current phase limits the authors' capacity to address feedback immediately.
- The initial strict standpoint on Bayesian inferences may have led to confusion regarding the scope of their analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 3 by restructuring the presentation to start from the final goal of approximating \( p(\Phi | D) \) and clearly outline the integrals involved. Additionally, the authors should provide a more thorough validation and sensitivity analysis of their method against alternative models and discuss the computational intensity of their approach in detail. It would also be beneficial to include a discussion on the robustness of the results concerning prior specifications and to expand on the implications of score equivalence in the context of GPNs. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors explicitly distinguish between Bayesian and non-Bayesian analyses and enhance the discussion on timing and computational costs to provide a more comprehensive understanding of their work. Finally, we encourage them to incorporate the suggested references to better contextualize their findings within the broader literature on Bayesian networks.
