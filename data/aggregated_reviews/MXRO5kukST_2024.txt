Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel variant of the transformer architecture, SAND (Self-Attention on Derivatives), aimed at addressing the imputation of functional data from noisy or sparse observations. The authors introduce derivative and integral operators to enhance the standard transformer, providing theoretical guarantees and empirical evaluations that demonstrate SAND's superior performance compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The writing is clear, with a smooth logical flow, effectively addressing an important problem.
2. The paper presents a complete narrative with robust theoretical analysis and extensive empirical results that validate the new architecture.
3. The method is well-motivated, particularly the incorporation of the derivative and integral operators to tackle smoothness issues.

Weaknesses:
1. The theoretical results primarily justify the architecture's ability to approximate FPCA, lacking insights into why SAND outperforms standard transformers for imputation.
2. The design of the derivative operator is not intuitive and does not align well with conventional derivative definitions.
3. Larger-scale benchmark experiments and an efficiency analysis of SAND are needed to further substantiate its advantages.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the notation in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 by adding a notation paragraph to define terms like the bolded tilde \( T \) and \( T_c \). Additionally, we suggest including a simple baseline comparison, such as a standard transformer with smoothing post-processing techniques like locally adaptive regression splines (LARS) or trend filtering. Furthermore, elaborating on the role of attention in SAND would enhance the understanding of its advantages.
