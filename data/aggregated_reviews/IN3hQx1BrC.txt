Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel model-based algorithm termed Task-aware Environment Modeling Pipeline with Bi-level Optimization (TEMPO), which combines the benefits of value-based and reconstruction-based methods. The authors propose a bi-level optimization framework that trains an upper-level weight network to generate non-uniform sample weights, optimizing a task-aware loss while a low-level RSSM learns state representations. The performance of TEMPO is evaluated across various benchmarks, including continuous control tasks and video games, with results indicating that it meets or exceeds the performance of DreamerV2.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized, clearly written, and effectively motivates the combination of meta-learning and world models.
- The quantity and quality of experiments are commendable, providing a solid basis for the claims made.
- The proposed methodology shows promise in addressing established issues in model-based reinforcement learning.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for the proposed method is not sufficiently clear, with some factual inaccuracies regarding the limitations of existing approaches.
- The experimental results are based on a limited number of random seeds, which raises concerns about their reliability.
- Comparisons to more recent world model approaches, such as DreamerV3, are lacking, and the related work section could benefit from more contextual analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for their approach, ensuring that claims about existing methods are accurate. Additionally, including comparisons to newer baselines like DreamerV3 would strengthen the paper's justification for using DreamerV2. We suggest conducting more extensive experiments with additional random seeds to enhance the reliability of the results. Furthermore, a more detailed discussion of the results, particularly regarding outliers like Hopper Stand, would provide valuable insights. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify their contributions in relation to prior work and to consider significance testing to support their performance claims.
