Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to detecting lip-syncing forgeries, addressing a significant gap in current DeepFake detection methods. The authors propose a new dataset, AVLips, and a method called LipFD, which extracts both global and local features to enhance detection accuracy. The method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving up to 94% average accuracy in LipSync detection across nearly one hundred thousand samples.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The work introduces a meaningful research problem in lip forgery detection and provides a substantial dataset for this issue.
2. The method focuses on generating features from the lips region, which is a novel approach.
3. The experimental results indicate high effectiveness and robustness, particularly in real-world scenarios.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks an ablation study on the local feature extraction branches, making it unclear how performance is affected by their removal.
2. There are several unclear expressions and missing explanations in equations, particularly regarding $RA(\cdot)$ and $[F_G|\{F_R\}^i_j]$.
3. The diversity of fake videos in the training set is limited, potentially leading to overfitting, and the method's generalizability across different datasets is not well demonstrated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by providing detailed explanations for the unclear expressions in the equations. Additionally, conducting an ablation study to assess the impact of each local feature extraction branch on performance would strengthen the paper. Expanding the dataset to include a wider variety of fake video generation methods could enhance the model's generalizability. Furthermore, addressing the limitations section explicitly would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the study's constraints.
