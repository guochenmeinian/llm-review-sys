Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework called graph convolutional kernel machine (GCKM) for graph-based machine learning, integrating kernel functions with graph convolution. The authors propose GCKSVM for node classification, GCKSC for node clustering, and extensions for graph-level learning. Experimental results indicate that GCKMs achieve competitive accuracy compared to graph convolutional networks (GCNs). The framework is noted for its computational efficiency and theoretical analyses.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. GCKM is a novel framework that simplifies training compared to GCNs, guarantees globally optimal solutions, and demonstrates strong generalization ability.
2. The authors provide a generalization bound for GCKSVM, justifying its advantages over traditional kernel SVM.
3. Extensions for node clustering and graph classification are included, along with efficient feature transformation methods.
4. Numerical evaluations show that GCKMs perform at least as effectively as GCNs.

Weaknesses:
1. The extension GCKPCA is not evaluated in Section 3.3.
2. Important results are relegated to the supplement, necessitating a reorganization to include key numerical justifications and experiments in the main text.
3. The paper primarily tests small datasets, raising questions about performance on larger datasets.
4. The clarity of Theorem 1's value and its practical implications for GCKM design is insufficiently addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation of GCKPCA in Section 3.3 and consider reorganizing the paper to include essential results in the main text. Additionally, we suggest providing a recursive or explicit formulation for deep GCKM and clarifying the statement regarding the influence of kernel size on training. The authors should also elaborate on the rationale behind using the sum of node features for graph-level features, considering alternatives like mean or min/max. Lastly, we encourage the authors to highlight the computational complexity of GCKM compared to implicit feature transformation methods and to clarify the definition of "large" datasets in their claims.
