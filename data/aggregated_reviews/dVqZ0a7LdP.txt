Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ReMAP, a model reprogramming-based strategy designed to adapt a foundation model for forecasting joint motion in amputee subjects, utilizing a dataset of below-knee amputees. The method employs network inversion and retrieval-augmented mapping to match target samples with the closest source samples from able-bodied individuals, aiming to effectively repurpose pretrained models without extensive retraining. The empirical results indicate that ReMAP outperforms traditional methods like zero-shot and fine-tuning approaches. Additionally, the authors clarify that while training utilizes able-bodied data, inference does not have access to this data, necessitating the neural network's role in mapping inputs to desired outputs. The dataset includes five unique amputee subjects across various locomotion tasks, with a training ratio of 0.1 for refurbishing module training. The authors aim to demonstrate the model's ability to generalize to variations in amputee motion.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The research addresses a critical issue in assistive technology, with significant societal implications for improving mobility in individuals with impairments.
2. The computational efficiency of the reprogramming-based adaptation is promising in the context of foundation models.
3. The authors have collected a valuable dataset and plan to open-source it.
4. The authors have taken ethical compliance measures seriously, including IRB approval and participant consent.
5. The approach of using neural networks for motion prediction is innovative and addresses a significant gap in the literature regarding amputee locomotion.

Weaknesses:
1. Certain methodological descriptions are unclear, particularly regarding the definitions of task-shared vs. task-specific, the distinction between direct-mapping and fine-tuning, and the absence of baseline results for "cross-mapping."
2. Reported numerical results for neighbor search and network inversion lack significant differences, raising questions about the superiority of network inversion.
3. The paper does not provide correction-based results alongside target-based results, limiting insights into their contributions.
4. The claim that reprogramming outperforms fine-tuning is counterintuitive and requires further clarification regarding the number of trainable parameters.
5. The calculation of $\tilde{y}_{amp}$ from able-bodied individuals is not clearly explained, and the template searching strategy assumes alignment that may not hold true.
6. The responses provided by the authors lack clarity and do not convincingly address the reviewers' concerns about the agreement and the derivation of ground truth for amputees.
7. The methodological contributions appear incremental, with similarities to existing literature on network inversion techniques, raising questions about the novelty of the work.
8. The paper lacks a detailed description of the foundation model's architecture and does not justify the choice of evaluation metrics, particularly R2.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity in methodological descriptions, particularly regarding task-shared vs. task-specific definitions and the differences between direct-mapping and fine-tuning. Additionally, we suggest providing baseline results for "cross-mapping" and clarifying the significance of reported numerical results for neighbor search and network inversion. It would be beneficial to include correction-based results to enhance interpretability. We also advise the authors to elaborate on the comparison of trainable parameters between reprogramming and fine-tuning approaches. Furthermore, a more detailed explanation of how $\tilde{y}_{amp}$ is derived and the assumptions regarding template searching should be included. We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their responses regarding the agreement and the derivation of ground truth for amputees, ensuring that these details are explicitly included in the paper. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide a comprehensive description of the foundation model's architecture and consider alternative evaluation metrics that may better reflect the functional performance of prosthetic devices. To strengthen the claim of generalizability, we suggest that the authors provide results from other tasks beyond the current use case, such as human-computer interaction or autonomous driving, where data scarcity and test-time adaptation are relevant.
