Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the OoD-ViT-NAS benchmark, which evaluates the Out-of-Distribution (OoD) generalization capabilities of Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures. The authors construct a comprehensive benchmark that includes 8 large-scale OoD datasets and 3,000 ViT architectures, allowing for a thorough investigation into the impact of ViT architecture on OoD generalization. The findings reveal that in-domain accuracy does not reliably predict OoD performance, while simpler metrics like parameter count and FLOPs correlate better with OoD accuracy. Increased embedding dimensions notably improve performance, and the authors provide program code, the benchmark, and detailed instructions to ensure reproducibility. The study validates the ineffectiveness of complex training-free NAS methods compared to simpler proxies, highlighting the significant influence of architectural attributes on OoD generalization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of the OoD-ViT-NAS benchmark is a significant contribution to the field of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for ViTs.
- The study provides a thorough investigation into how ViT architectural attributes affect OoD generalization, particularly emphasizing the impact of embedding dimensions.
- The benchmark covers a wide range of datasets and architectures, enhancing its comprehensiveness.
- The commitment to reproducibility is commendable, with public release of code and benchmarks, and positive feedback from reviewers indicating a strong impact on the field.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a discussion on the practical implications of the findings and potential applications of the benchmark.
- The analysis of experimental results is somewhat superficial, lacking deeper insights into why certain architectural attributes perform better under OoD conditions.
- The need for more extensive comparisons with existing methods is noted, which could help contextualize the results within the broader research landscape.
- The study is limited to the Autoformer architecture space, which may restrict the generalizability of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the practical implications of their findings and how these insights can influence future ViT designs. Additionally, a more profound analysis of the experimental results is needed, including theoretical justifications for the observed phenomena. The authors should consider expanding their study beyond the Autoformer architecture to enhance the generalizability of their conclusions. Furthermore, we suggest presenting charts of OoD accuracy against latency and GPU memory consumption, as these metrics are crucial for real-world applications. Finally, we recommend including more extensive comparisons with existing methods to better contextualize the results.
