Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents PrivCirNet, a framework aimed at enhancing the efficiency of private deep neural network (DNN) inference through homomorphic encryption (HE) and multi-party computation (MPC). Key contributions include transforming DNN weights into block circulant matrices to facilitate HE-friendly computations, customizing the HE encoding algorithm to optimize performance based on block size, and employing latency-aware formulations for layer-wise block size assignments. The framework demonstrates significant improvements in latency and accuracy across various models and datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The use of block circulant transformation for optimizing HE-based DNN inference is novel and innovative.  
- The paper includes thorough evaluations and comparisons with existing methods, providing strong evidence of the proposed framework's effectiveness.  
- The structure and presentation are clear, making the methodology and results easy to understand.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks the actual implementation code necessary for reproducing the simulation results.  
- There is insufficient clarity on the evaluation of nonlinear layers and the specific crypto primitives used.  
- Some statements are misleading, particularly regarding the bottleneck of linear layers in comparison to nonlinear layers in prior work.  
- The novelty of employing block circulant matrices is limited, as similar concepts have been explored previously.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing a detailed explanation of plaintext encoding in the BFV scheme and the conversion between BFV and MPC. Additionally, the authors should include a table comparing the use of block circulant matrices with prior work in the main text. We suggest repeating experiments on RegNet and ConvNeXt across multiple datasets, particularly CIFAR-100, to validate the efficacy of the encoding mechanism against larger hidden dimensions. Furthermore, addressing the inconsistencies in table layouts and ensuring that all statements are accurate and well-supported will enhance the overall quality of the paper.
