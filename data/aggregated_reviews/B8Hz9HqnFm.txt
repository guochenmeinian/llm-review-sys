### Key Points
This paper presents a novel end-to-end speech translation model designed for zero-shot settings, addressing the challenges of limited parallel data. The authors propose using Word Rotator Distance (WRD) loss to connect Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Machine Translation (MT) modules, facilitating the integration of these two modalities. The method allows for independent training of the embedding representation without requiring triplet supervision data, with the potential for fine-tuning when such data is available.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The integration of WRD loss and the shrink adapter effectively addresses multi-modal discrepancies.  
- The experiments are thorough, and the model diagrams are well illustrated, enhancing the paper's presentation.  
- The proposed method shows competitive performance compared to existing CTC-based cascade models.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks clarity and coherence, making it difficult to follow, with insufficient explanations of variables and table entries.  
- There is a limited comparison with state-of-the-art ASR systems, such as Conformer-CTC with an external language model, raising concerns about the generalizability of the results.  
- The reported results lack clarity regarding the experimental settings used for prior work, and the significance of observed differences in the ablation study is not addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and readability of the paper by providing more detailed explanations of variables and table entries. Additionally, including a more comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art ASR systems, particularly Conformer-CTC with an external language model, would strengthen the evaluation of their method. It would also be beneficial to clarify the experimental settings for prior work and conduct significance tests to validate the differences observed in the results. Lastly, ensure that all references, especially for CTC, are included to aid readers from different domains.
