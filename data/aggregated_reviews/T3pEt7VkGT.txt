### Key Points
The paper presents a segmentation network developed for the “CVPR 2024: Segment Anything In Medical Images On Laptop” Challenge, utilizing a SAM-like model with a SWIN-T backbone trained from scratch on provided and external datasets. The model is distilled to a lightweight RepViT-M0.6 encoder, outperforming the LiteMedSAM baseline in DSC, NSD, and inference speed. The authors emphasize the simplicity, resource efficiency, and reproducibility of their approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
- The model leverages established encoder backbones and knowledge distillation, leading to an efficient and high-performing outcome.
- The non-distilled network matches LiteMedSAM's inference speed and is significantly more efficient during training.
- The availability of code on GitHub ensures reproducibility.

**Weaknesses:**
- The improvements over MedSAM are ambiguous, as it is unclear if they stem from the larger dataset or the new architecture and training pipeline.
- The size of the external dataset is not specified, which would enhance clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We suggest explicitly reporting the DSC and NSD scores in the abstract rather than relative to LiteMedSAM. In the methods section, we recommend clarifying the source of the training data and correcting inconsistencies regarding the encoder used. Additionally, we advise providing a formula or links for the loss functions and clarifying the output size after post-processing. Finally, we note the need to correct references to tables in the checklist and ensure the inclusion of all modalities in the data preprocessing section.
