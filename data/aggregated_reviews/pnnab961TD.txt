### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to guided text generation that addresses the issue of "over-concentrated information" in large language models by utilizing a knowledge graph. The authors propose a comprehensive pipeline comprising a local knowledge filter, dynamic entity selector, and a FiD-based generator. The method is evaluated using three datasets, demonstrating consistent performance improvements over existing models like GPT-2 and BART across various metrics, including perplexity and ROUGE-L.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized, clearly written, and logically structured.
- The proposed method outperforms baseline models on multiple evaluation metrics, indicating its effectiveness.
- The identification of the "over-concentrated information" issue is a significant contribution to the field.

Weaknesses:
- Readability is hindered by typos and unclear points, such as the lack of a termination condition in Algorithm 1.
- The evaluation metrics may favor the proposed method, and the choice of baselines is somewhat outdated.
- The method's reliance on triples from a knowledge graph raises concerns about its performance in scenarios where such triples are unavailable.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by addressing typos and providing a termination condition for Algorithm 1. Additionally, we suggest that the authors justify their choice of models in the pipeline and compare their approach with more recent state-of-the-art models. To enhance the robustness of their findings, the authors should also explore the method's performance in the absence of triples from a knowledge graph. Lastly, providing a more comprehensive explanation of the significance of incorporating additional entities in the text generation process would strengthen the paper's argument.
