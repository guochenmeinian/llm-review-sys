### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the detection-segmentation imbalance issue in MaskDINO, proposing the DI-MaskDINO model with a residual double-selection mechanism to address this imbalance. The framework includes the De-Imbalance (DI) module and Balance-Aware Tokens Optimization (BATO) module, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in both object detection and instance segmentation across various benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The identification of the detection-segmentation imbalance in MaskDINO is an interesting and novel contribution.
2. The proposed method demonstrates effectiveness, achieving SOTA results in object detection and instance segmentation.
3. The paper is well-structured, with clear experimental results.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation for the De-Imbalance module lacks sufficient verification; the claim regarding token interaction's role is not supported by experiments or theoretical backing.
2. The Balance-Aware Tokens Optimization module comprises several components, yet lacks detailed experimental analysis for each design.
3. The generalizability of the proposed approach to other decoder-based methods is not addressed, limiting its broader applicability.
4. Experimental results on the COCO test set are absent, hindering fair comparisons.
5. The claim of improvement over SOTA results is undermined by the lack of comprehensive reporting for the MaskDINO-SwinL under different epochs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the verification of the De-Imbalance module's motivation by providing additional experiments or heatmap visualizations to substantiate their claims. Furthermore, we suggest conducting an experimental analysis of each component within the Balance-Aware Tokens Optimization module. To enhance the generalizability of the proposed method, we encourage the authors to explore its applicability to other decoder-based methods. Additionally, we advise including experimental results on the COCO test set for more equitable comparisons. Lastly, we recommend clarifying the performance gap observations and providing a solid definition of the "imbalance" problem to strengthen the paper's argument.
