Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for recovering coverage guarantees in conformal predictions amidst adversarial attacks, leveraging verifiable methods for neural networks to compute prediction scores. The authors propose two variants of their framework, VRCP-I and VRCP-C, which compute bounds at inference and calibration stages, respectively. Empirical tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach against various adversarial norms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Empirical results substantiate the advantages of the proposed method over vanilla conformal predictions and RSCP+.
2. The approach exhibits robustness across different adversarial perturbation values.
3. The paper is well-written and accessible, with a clear description of the methods and theoretical support for coverage guarantees.

Weaknesses:
1. The focus on PDG limits the assessment of robustness against more sophisticated attacks available in the literature.
2. The paper does not clarify whether the ML model under attack was adversarially trained, raising questions about the validity of the proposed approach in such scenarios.
3. Figure 2 lacks clarity regarding which curves represent the proposed method versus benchmarks, and the behavior of coverage as adversarial perturbation increases is not adequately explained.
4. The novelty of combining neural network verification with conformal prediction is acknowledged, but further exploration of tighter conformity scores and their suitability for different certification types is warranted.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the robustness assessment of their approach by evaluating it against more advanced adversarial attacks. Additionally, clarifying the implications of adversarial training on the proposed method's effectiveness would enhance the paper's depth. We suggest revising Figure 2 for better readability and providing a clearer explanation of the observed phenomena. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to discuss potential extensions and optimizations, such as proof sharing for VRCP-C and alternative score functions, to strengthen their contribution. Lastly, providing more context on the experimental setup, particularly for regression tasks, would benefit the clarity of the results.
