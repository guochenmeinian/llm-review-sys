Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SheetCopilot, a model designed to translate natural language tasks into executable command sequences for spreadsheet manipulation. The authors propose a framework that utilizes atomic actions as abstractions of spreadsheet functionalities, employing a state-machine-based approach for task planning. They also introduce a curated dataset for evaluating their tool, which demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline methods, including state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors tackle the complex problem of automating spreadsheet modifications, which could significantly benefit users.
- A systematic approach is taken to create a curated dataset of real-world spreadsheet tasks.
- The framework's design, including ablation studies, shows promising results and highlights the impact of various components on performance.

Weaknesses:
- The contributions of the paper are moderate, as the intermediate language of atomic actions resembles known approaches in software engineering.
- The reliance on synonyms for atomic action names may introduce risks, complicating task-action connections.
- The benchmark creation process raises concerns about potential data overlap with LLM pretraining, affecting generalization capabilities.
- The tasks addressed may be overly simplistic, raising questions about the framework's scalability to more complex scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the complexity and categorization of the curated task dataset, including insights into the nature of the tasks. Additionally, further investigation into why GPT-3.5Turbo outperforms GPT-4 would be beneficial. We suggest incorporating more detailed metrics for dataset evaluation rather than relying solely on tag clouds. Furthermore, a discussion on performance-latency trade-offs and user satisfaction metrics should be included to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the framework's practical implications. Lastly, clarifying the public availability of the dataset would enhance transparency and facilitate further research.
