Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the (non-)monotonicity of equilibrium payoffs in two-player games, with implications for strategic machine learning. The authors propose that if the unique equilibrium is not Pareto-optimal, a player can unilaterally restrict their action space to achieve a better equilibrium. They also introduce an algorithm for selecting the optimal "model class" in this context. The paper highlights a Braess'-paradox-like phenomenon where increased model expressivity can lead to decreased equilibrium performance, challenging conventional scaling laws in machine learning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The authors identify a relevant phenomenon regarding model selection and equilibrium performance, contributing to the understanding of strategic interactions in machine learning.  
- The paper is well-written and presents clear assumptions and illustrative examples, making the theoretical insights accessible.  

Weaknesses:  
- The model's assumptions, such as the uniqueness of equilibrium, may be overly idealized for practical applications in strategic machine learning.  
- The theoretical results rely on strong assumptions that may not hold in practice, and the lack of empirical validation raises concerns about the applicability of the findings.  
- The proposed algorithm for model selection may require a computationally expensive number of interactions with the environment as the candidate set size increases.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the robustness of their theoretical results by addressing the strong assumptions made, particularly regarding the uniqueness of Nash equilibria and the availability of SGD estimators. Additionally, we suggest incorporating empirical evaluations to validate the theoretical claims presented. Clarifying the relationship between model selection and commitment in the context of the paper would enhance the reader's understanding. Lastly, we encourage the authors to consider more representative illustrative examples that reflect practical applications and to clarify the online learning aspect mentioned in Section 4.
