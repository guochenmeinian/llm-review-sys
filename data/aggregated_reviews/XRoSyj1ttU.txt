### Key Points
This paper presents EchoQA, a question-answering dataset designed for instruction-tuning and zero-shot evaluation of LLMs in the context of echocardiogram reports, a prevalent task in cardiology. The authors evaluate the performance of various generalist and biomedical-domain LLMs, demonstrating the benchmark's usability through instruction-tuning and zero-shot evaluations. Additionally, the paper includes a fairness audit focused on social determinants of health, enhancing transparency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The dataset addresses an unmet need in cardiology tasks for LLMs.  
- The proof-of-concept validation through instruction-tuning and zero-shot evaluations reveals significant performance gaps in current models.  
- The fairness audit is well-conceived, focusing on application-specific slices rather than generic protected attributes, exemplifying a thoughtful approach to fairness in ML and healthcare.  
- Releasing the dataset via PhysioNet will enhance its accessibility and impact.  

Weaknesses:  
- The question-generation process lacks clarity regarding which questions are clinician-generated versus those extracted through text analysis.  
- The related works section could be improved by discussing existing models and benchmarks in LLMs and cardiology, such as EchoGPT and HEART.  
- (Minor) The text in Figure 2 is excessively small; consider increasing the figure size.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the question-generation process by specifying the roles of clinicians in generating versus extracting questions. Additionally, we suggest expanding the related works section to include discussions on relevant models and benchmarks in LLMs and cardiology. Lastly, we advise increasing the figure size in Figure 2 for better readability.
