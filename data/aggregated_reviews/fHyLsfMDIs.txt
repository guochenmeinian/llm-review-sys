Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to solving the dynamic entropic optimal transport (EOT) problem, also known as the Schr√∂dinger bridge problem, using a neural solver. The authors propose a saddle-point, maximin formulation of EOT, resulting in a GAN-like algorithm that can be trained end-to-end. The method is evaluated through experiments on 2D toy datasets and image translation tasks, showcasing competitive results and introducing a new Gaussian benchmark.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The saddle point reformulation of EOT is innovative and connects to stochastic control, where the terminal cost function $\beta$ is learned to align the policy with the terminal distribution.
- The paper is well-written, making complex ideas accessible, and includes sufficient related works and preliminaries.
- Extensive experiments are conducted, comparing against multiple baselines and quantifying errors in sampling and transport.

Weaknesses:
- The algorithm's objective to minimize (12) is not well-defined at $\epsilon=0$, leading to a disconnect from the mathematical framework. Additional justification connecting to optimal transport is needed.
- The proposed method closely resembles recent maximum optimal transport approaches, and a comparison with these methods, especially at $\epsilon=0$, is warranted.
- The connection between sections discussing EOT and the main content is weak; integrating relevant parts into the background section is recommended.
- Some experimental metrics are not introduced, and the lack of error bars makes it difficult to assess robustness and training stability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the algorithm's objective by addressing the implications of $\epsilon=0$ and providing a connection to optimal transport. Additionally, we suggest including a comparison with recent maximum optimal transport methods in the results section. To strengthen the paper, we advise integrating relevant theoretical aspects into the background section and introducing all experimental metrics clearly. Lastly, we encourage the authors to include error bars in the experimental results to better demonstrate the robustness of their approach.
