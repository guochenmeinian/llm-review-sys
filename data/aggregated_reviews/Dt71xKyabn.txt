Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for evaluating graph generative models using curvature-related graph descriptors and comparing the distributions of input and reconstructed datasets. The authors propose a curvature-based filtration process and utilize a persistent landscape metric for graph evaluation, noted for its robustness, stability, and expressivity. They also suggest using distance metrics, such as Wasserstein distance and KL divergence, to measure distribution similarity, emphasizing its importance for generative model performance. The manuscript includes theoretical properties of the landscapes and diverse experiments on synthetic and real graph datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research is original, contributing a unique curvature-based TDA model for evaluating graph generative models.
- The method shows improvements in expressivity, robustness, and scalability compared to conventional methods like MMD.
- The theoretical results demonstrate stability and expressivity of landscapes compared to raw filtrations.
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The advantages of using curvature as a filtration parameter and the specific filtration process are unclear.
- There is no formulation of a single end-to-end algorithm for evaluating graph generative models, leading to a lack of a unified score.
- The manuscript lacks experiments with real graph generative models and does not adequately compare with existing distance measures.
- There is a lack of clarity regarding the novelty and necessity of the proposed method's elements.
- The justification for using mean comparisons as a measure of distribution evaluation is questioned, as it may not adequately reflect reconstruction performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the advantages of using curvature as a filtration parameter and provide discussions on its benefits compared to other filtration methods. Additionally, the authors should consider formulating a single end-to-end algorithm for evaluating graph generative models to yield a unified score. Including experiments with real graph generative models would enhance the manuscript's impact. We also suggest that the authors clarify the rationale behind choosing persistent landscapes for vectorization and address the limitations of their approach in comparison to other distance measures, such as graph edit distance. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors explicitly detail the novelty and impact of each component of their methodology and address the concerns regarding the appropriateness of mean comparisons in evaluating distributions, potentially considering higher-order moments for a more comprehensive analysis. Lastly, we encourage the authors to enhance the discussion on the applicability of conventional methods for comparing graph distributions, ensuring that their approach is clearly distinguished from existing techniques.
