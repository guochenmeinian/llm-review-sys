Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a neural oscillator framework that combines nonlinear dynamics with a linear read-out, proving a universal approximation theorem for multi-layer neural oscillators. The authors demonstrate that these oscillators can approximate causal and continuous maps between spaces of continuous functions. The construction relies on the properties of forced harmonic oscillators and windowed sine transforms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The universal approximation property provides significant theoretical support for neural network architectures, marking a novel contribution with the Universality theorem for neural oscillators.
- The proof strategy is clear, with a well-structured outline and effective illustrations, particularly in Figure 1.
- The paper offers a novel proof approach utilizing time-windowed sine transforms, and the construction of a three-layer neural oscillator structure is both ingenious and methodical.

Weaknesses:
- The title is confusing and should clarify what is meant by 'universal' (e.g., universal approximator).
- There is insufficient discussion on how the universality result contributes to existing work, and the applicability of the proposed structure is limited due to its design, which complicates gradient-based training methods.
- The proof of the Fundamental Lemma contains cyclic reasoning, raising questions about its validity, particularly concerning the implementation of the target function with oscillator networks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the title for clarity regarding the concept of 'universality.' Additionally, a more detailed discussion on the implications of the universality result in relation to existing literature would enhance the paper's contribution. Addressing the cyclic reasoning in the proof of the Fundamental Lemma is crucial for strengthening the overall argument. Furthermore, exploring the effects of network width and depth on expressiveness, as well as the potential for new training methods that align with the proposed structure, would be beneficial.
