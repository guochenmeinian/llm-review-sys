### Key Points
This paper presents an interactive prompt-engineering technique for Large Language Models (LLMs) called ChatLogic. Instead of prompting the LLM to reason in English, it outputs reasoning in a logic programming language (pyDatalog). The system employs light semantic and syntactic corrections through interactive sessions with the LLM, leading to improved multi-step reasoning accuracy on standard datasets. The novelty lies in its use of semantic self-correction by translating code back to natural language, which is a new technique in this context.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The LLM+ChatLogic system consistently outperforms baseline LLMs and zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting in multi-step reasoning tasks.
- The inclusion of an ablation study demonstrates the contributions of both semantic and syntactic self-correction components to performance.
- The paper is well-organized, with effective figures that communicate the structure and advantages of ChatLogic.

Weaknesses:
- Claims of significant performance improvements lack confidence intervals and statistical significance discussions.
- The assertion that the approach reduces hallucination is unsubstantiated, as no measurements of hallucination are provided.
- Many sentences are confusing and hard to parse, with instances of unclear terminology and flowery language that obscure the paper's contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their writing by breaking up long run-on sentences and establishing clear sign-posts at the beginning and end of paragraphs. Additionally, please define "CoT," "zero-shot," and "one-shot" clearly and provide examples of basic chain-of-thought usage. We also suggest including one-shot prompting in the results to support claims regarding the mix-shot approach's accuracy. Lastly, we advise revising misleading language that embellishes the contributions of the paper, ensuring that the significance of the work is communicated more straightforwardly.
