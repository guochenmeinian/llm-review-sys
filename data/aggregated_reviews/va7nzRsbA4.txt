### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of the effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting in large language models (LLMs). The authors systematically investigate how elements such as "symbols" (e.g., digits, entities) and "patterns" (e.g., equations, sentence structures) influence model performance through counterfactual prompting. The findings, derived from various tasks including mathematical, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning, reveal that while symbols have a limited impact, consistent patterns are crucial for eliciting CoT performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper systematically explores the influence of fine-grained elements on CoT effectiveness, providing valuable insights into language model behavior.
- It includes thorough evaluations across multiple settings and language models, supported by extensive experimental results.
- The analysis of ablation experiments offers a deeper understanding of when and why CoT prompting works.

Weaknesses:
- The definitions of "symbols" and "patterns" are vague, leading to potential confusion regarding their application across different tasks.
- Some claims lack clarity and sufficient backing, particularly regarding the implications of specific patterns and their relevance to web frequency.
- The paper does not adequately differentiate its findings from related works, such as those by Wang et al. (2022) and Ye et al. (2022), which also explore similar counterfactual probing experiments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definitions for "symbols" and "patterns" to ensure a better understanding of their roles in the analysis. Additionally, we suggest providing more detailed discussions on the differences between this work and related studies to highlight the unique contributions of this paper. Finally, enhancing the summarization of findings and their implications would strengthen the overall impact of the research.
