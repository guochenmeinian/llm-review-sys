Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical framework for multimodal learning, demonstrating that multimodal neural networks can outperform unimodal networks on unimodal tasks. The authors establish generalization bounds using Gaussian averaging and explore the roles of connection and heterogeneity in this context. Their findings indicate that under specific conditions, multimodal learning achieves superior generalization performance compared to unimodal learning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for the study is strong, addressing an important yet underexplored area in multimodal learning.
- The theoretical investigation is novel, particularly in characterizing multimodal learning through connection and heterogeneity.
- The paper is well-organized and presents clear illustrations, enhancing readability.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical framework relies on numerous assumptions that may not be realistic, necessitating more natural assumptions and examples.
- The results would be more compelling if supported by toy experiments with synthetic datasets to demonstrate practical applicability.
- The presentation requires significant improvement, with unclear explanations and notation that may confuse readers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their explanations, particularly regarding Equation (1), to avoid confusion about the minimization process. Explicitly writing out $s_{t1}=(x_{t1},y_{t1},z_{t1})$ in line 186 would enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest including discussions on fully supervised settings and exploring the implications of multimodal learning with more than two modalities. Incorporating literature on multi-view learning and conducting numerical experiments to support the theoretical claims would strengthen the paper. Lastly, addressing the circular reasoning regarding heterogeneity and providing more realistic examples would enhance the depth of the analysis.
