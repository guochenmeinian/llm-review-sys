### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to eliminate the need for Analog to Digital conversion after an analog vector matrix multiplication performed with a Resistive memory crossbar. Instead, the authors propose using an analog content addressable memory (ACAM) to implement the non-linear functions applied post-multiplication in deep neural networks (DNNs). The paper includes experimental results from a fabricated crossbar and simulations that quantify the performance of the proposed system, termed Nonlinear DPE (NL-DPE), which integrates a Noise-Aware fine-tuning (NAF) procedure to address analog noise.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is clearly written and easy to follow.
- It contributes valuable insights into analog hardware, enhancing the understanding of its challenges within the broader machine learning community.
- The implementation of analog activation functions is innovative and shows promise.

Weaknesses:
- The NAF procedure appears to worsen performance on ResNets with ACAM noise, as indicated in Table 1, and only marginally improves performance under DPE noise.
- The evaluation of ResNets is limited to CIFAR-10, omitting potentially valuable insights from the ImageNet dataset.
- The necessity of learning decision trees for activation functions is unclear, given that their analytical forms are known; a systematic method for hardcoding these functions into decision trees should be explored.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the distinction between ADC replacement and the role of ACAM, as it may be misleading. Additionally, we suggest providing clearer delineation between simulated and measured results, particularly regarding the derivation of Figure 6. The presence of an ADC in Fig 4a should be justified, considering the preceding digital circuit. Lastly, we encourage the authors to address the performance issues associated with the NAF procedure and explore systematic methods for integrating known activation functions into decision trees.
