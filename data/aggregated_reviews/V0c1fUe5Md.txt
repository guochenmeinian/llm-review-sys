### Key Points
This paper presents the Crypto Casino DelegateeMiner (CCDM), an innovative method for identifying hidden participant roles in crypto casinos. By utilizing a multi-view graph neural network (GNN) framework combined with 1D and 2D structural entropy, the authors achieve a fine-grained role-level analysis, marking a significant advancement from traditional address-level detection. The approach is validated using real-world data from Ethereum, TRON, and Arbitrum, demonstrating its effectiveness and applicability in the crypto-gambling ecosystem.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The CCDM method uniquely integrates voting influence metrics, structural entropy, and GNN techniques, showcasing methodological innovation in role recognition without labeled data.
- The multi-perspective GNN framework enhances classification accuracy by incorporating local, temporal, and global structure views.
- Experimental validation on major blockchains confirms the method's effectiveness and generalizability.

Weaknesses:
- The paper claims near-linear complexity for ChainVoteEntropy, but the quadratic complexity in role identification stages may hinder scalability for large datasets.
- The model's adaptability to dynamic transaction networks is unclear, raising concerns about robustness and feature dependency.
- The motivation for the voting-based metric lacks clarity, and the novelty of the approach in relation to existing research is not well articulated.
- The ablation study could be more emphasized to clarify the contributions of individual model components.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the model's adaptability to noise in input graphs, particularly in datasets with irregular transaction patterns. Additionally, measures to ensure the robustness of the ChainVoteEntropy metric against adversarial manipulations should be elaborated. The role of the balance parameter (\(\alpha\)) in the joint loss function (\(L\)) needs clarification, including sensitivity analyses to evaluate its impact on performance. The authors should also explore optimizations for scalability in high-density blockchains like TRON and provide a clearer motivation for the voting-based metric in the introduction. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of clustering methods, particularly the advantages of Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering over K-means and DBSCAN, should be included. Lastly, enhancing the clarity of figures and addressing typos will improve the manuscript's readability and interpretability.
