### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for comparing classifiers through multicriteria evaluation, introducing the GSD-front based on generalized stochastic dominance (GSD). The authors propose a sound inference framework, including hypothesis tests to determine if a new classifier belongs to the GSD-front. The study investigates theoretical aspects of the GSD-front and its empirical variant, the $\epsilon$-empirical GSD-front, while conducting empirical studies on multiple datasets from OpenML and PMLB.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The method is sound and extremely useful.
2. The paper is well-written with consistent notation.
3. It significantly aids in identifying effective models across various tasks.
4. The hypothesis tests enhance the significance of the benchmarks.
5. All necessary information for understanding the paper is included in the main text.

Weaknesses:
1. A toy example could have illustrated the differences between GSD-front and Pareto-front more didactically.
2. The method appears computationally expensive, with the pmlb_permutation_tests.R script requiring 5 days to run, excluding model training.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the accessibility of the definition of $d_s$ and consider providing a toy example to clarify the differences between GSD-front and Pareto-front. Additionally, we suggest that the authors address the computational demands of their method, possibly by comparing the running time of a Pareto-front benchmark with that of a GSD-front. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to strengthen the motivation for comparing classifiers across diverse datasets and to provide additional recommendations for end-users, particularly regarding the selection of classifiers when multiple options exist in the GSD-front.
