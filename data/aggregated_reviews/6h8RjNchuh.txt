### Key Points
This paper presents a methodology called StatTexNet aimed at automating the selection of texture statistics for peripheral vision models. It employs a simple contrastive learning method to compress statistics and identifies important statistics through network weights, validating its approach using synthetic texture images based on first-order statistics. The authors utilize a pyramid-based network for reduced representation and conduct experiments on two datasets with various weighting metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The use of contrastive learning is reasonable and the inclusion of multiple evaluation methods is a merit.  
- The writing is generally clear and the methodology addresses an important aspect of visual attention.

Weaknesses:  
- The network architecture is overly simplistic, consisting of only one fully connected layer.  
- The paper lacks comparisons with other methods, such as autoencoders, and does not provide sufficient technical details about StatTexNet.  
- There are questions regarding the choice of hyperparameters, including the reduction of feature representation from 150 to 50 dimensions and the rationale behind using a single fully connected layer.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how their methodology can be directly applied to peripheral vision and gaze detection, possibly by providing a simplified description of the implications for visual attention. Additionally, we suggest that the authors include comparisons with other machine learning methods for texture statistics selection and conduct experiments to explore the impact of different output dimensions. Addressing the reviewers' questions regarding the retraining of models with depleted images and the use of higher-order statistics would also enhance the paper's depth.
