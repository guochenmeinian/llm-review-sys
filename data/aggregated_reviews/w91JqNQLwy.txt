Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel second-order method for sparse phase retrieval that demonstrates faster convergence and improved recovery compared to previous algorithms. The authors propose a method that reduces the size of the linear system solved at each iteration from \(n^3\) to \(s^3\) and establishes a quadratic convergence rate. The algorithm includes an initialization stage to ensure proximity to the true signal before applying the second-order method. Theoretical results confirm quadratic convergence, and experimental results indicate superior performance over first-order methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The algorithm shows lower per-iteration complexity and higher convergence rates compared to first-order methods, establishing a quadratic convergence rate.
- Experimental results clearly illustrate the proposed algorithm's superiority.
- The paper effectively communicates the motivation and complexity reduction achieved through the method.

Weaknesses:  
- The sample complexity for initialization and refinement is sub-optimal, potentially limiting real-world applicability.
- Experiments are primarily conducted on toy data, lacking practical comparisons with real-world phase recovery examples.
- The novelty is limited as the method is incremental compared to existing algorithms like Hard Thresholding Pursuit (HTP), which already exhibits second-order characteristics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the practical implications of the sub-optimal sample complexity for initialization and refinement stages. It would be beneficial to clarify how this affects the method's applicability to real-world signals. Additionally, we suggest conducting experimental comparisons on real-world phase recovery examples to strengthen the paper's contributions. A more detailed discussion on the differences and performance superiority over HTP, including a clear comparison of convergence results, would enhance the clarity of the contributions. Finally, addressing the sensitivity of the algorithm to the initial support choice and explaining the differences between the loss functions used in numerical experiments would provide valuable insights.
