Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework called Self-Calibrating Conformal Prediction, which combines Venn-Abers calibration with conformal prediction to provide calibrated point predictions and associated prediction intervals that are valid given these model predictions. The authors propose a method that jointly calibrates point predictions while ensuring valid coverage, leveraging theoretical foundations that include guarantees akin to conformal prediction methods and a convergence rate for the conformity scoring function.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The originality of the approach, extending Venn-Abers calibration to regression settings, is noteworthy.
- The theoretical foundations are robust, with clear assumptions and complete proofs, demonstrating important properties such as perfect calibration and self-calibration of prediction intervals.
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written, effectively motivating and formulating the methodology.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a comprehensive experimental evaluation, relying heavily on a single dataset, which limits the generalizability of the findings.
- There is insufficient comparison with other conformal regression methods, particularly regarding their calibration relative to the proposed method.
- The computational complexity of the proposed approach raises questions about its practical advantages over existing methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the intuitive explanation of why conditioning on \( f(X) \) approximates conditioning on \( X \), possibly by providing a concrete example. Additionally, the description of Venn-Abers calibration should be clarified to enhance understanding. The authors should also expand their experimental evaluation to include a wider range of datasets and compare their method with other robust conformal approaches, such as Conformal Quantile Regression. Furthermore, we suggest consolidating the limitations discussed throughout the paper into a dedicated "Limitations" section to enhance clarity for readers.
