### Key Points
This paper presents the **H-EDML framework**, which integrates hyperbolic and Euclidean geometries to effectively capture hierarchical and local interactions in graph data. The authors introduce a topology mutual learning module to enhance model performance and a decision mutual learning module for improved decision-making. Extensive experiments validate the framework's robustness and competitive performance across multiple datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The combination of hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces allows effective capture of both hierarchical and flat graph structures.
- The topology and decision mutual learning modules significantly enhance structure perception and decision accuracy.
- Experimental results demonstrate the model's robustness, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Weaknesses:
- The datasets used in experiments are too small, limiting generalizability.
- The two-stage training approach may increase computational overhead.
- The method's effectiveness is contingent on the quality of the underlying Euclidean and hyperbolic GNN models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset size to ensure more generalizable conclusions. Additionally, the authors should clarify the distinction between representational power and overfitting in their results. It would be beneficial to include a discussion of contrastive learning methods that combine GNNs and HGNNs, particularly addressing the exclusion of relevant baselines like [46]. Furthermore, the authors should explore the suitability of their approach for various tasks beyond node classification and provide insights into the generalization capabilities of the decision mutual learning module.
