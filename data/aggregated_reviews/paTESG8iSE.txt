### Key Points
This paper presents a study on likelihood-free hypothesis testing (LFHT) and mixed likelihood-free hypothesis testing (mLFHT), where the goal is to determine if a mixture coefficient $\nu$ is zero or exceeds a threshold $\delta$. The authors propose a kernel-based test statistic and analyze its performance theoretically, providing upper and lower bounds on sample complexity. They support their theoretical claims with experiments related to Higgs Boson detection and diffusion model image detection.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and motivated by practical applications, particularly in particle physics.
- It includes extensive experiments on real data and presents interesting theoretical support for empirical findings.
- The mathematical tools employed are sophisticated and may interest researchers in functional analysis and RKHS.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical bounds are difficult to interpret, particularly regarding the dependence on kernel eigenvalues; examples with simple kernels would enhance understanding.
- Some experimental methods, such as training a kernel on test data, are not adequately explained by the theory.
- The paper lacks clarity in transitions between sections, and the introduction is not sufficiently informative.
- The novelty of the results over existing work is not fully articulated, and some assumptions may limit applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the theoretical bounds by providing examples with simple kernels to illustrate their implications. Additionally, a more detailed explanation of the experimental methods, particularly regarding kernel training, should be included. We suggest enhancing the introduction to better position the work relative to prior research and to clarify the significance of the assumptions made. Finally, addressing the role of the mis-specification parameter $R$ in the theoretical framework would strengthen the paper's contributions.
