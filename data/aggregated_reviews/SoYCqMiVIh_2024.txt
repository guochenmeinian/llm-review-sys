Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method utilizing the Sinkhorn algorithm for optimal transport to enhance disease progression modeling, achieving a 1000x speed-up in inference and accommodating higher dimensionality in features. The authors demonstrate their approach through experiments on Alzheimerâ€™s disease and age-related macular degeneration, focusing on pixel-level disease progression events. They introduce the variational event-based model (vEBM) to enable interpretable high-dimensional models without sacrificing computational efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The experimental results indicate significant wall-clock improvements on synthetic datasets.
- The innovative perspective of disease progression modeling through optimal transport is compelling.
- The methodology is clearly articulated and supported by relevant literature.
- The datasets used for empirical results are of significant clinical importance.

Weaknesses:
- The realism of pixel-level disease progression simulations is questionable without quantitative comparisons to baseline or ground truth data.
- The method appears limited to population-level studies, potentially undermining its applicability for individual-level predictions.
- The treatment of pixels as separate features may overlook important spatial information, raising concerns about the method's effectiveness for pixel-level predictions.
- The related work section is brief, leaving the comprehensiveness of the literature review in doubt.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the realism of their pixel-level disease progression simulations by incorporating quantitative metrics, such as Intersection over Union, to compare against ground truth trajectories. Additionally, the authors should explore the implications of their method for individual-level predictions and clarify how insights from pixel-level estimations compare to region-level progressions. Enhancing the aesthetics of figures, particularly Figure 1, and providing clearer explanations of the relationships in Section 2.2 would also strengthen the presentation. Lastly, we suggest considering comparisons with alternative deep-learning-based models to broaden the discussion of the method's applicability.
