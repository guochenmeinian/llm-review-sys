Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents QACE, an algorithm designed for automatically learning the capabilities of sequential decision-making agents through distinguishing queries. The problem is framed around the predicates and capabilities of an agent, which are assumed to be known a priori. QACE computes a transition model that encodes the probabilities of executing a given capability in a specific state leading to another state. The authors propose that the algorithm can identify necessary preconditions by executing capabilities in various states, with a focus on practical examples such as a robot handing over a cup of tea. The authors provide theoretical guarantees of completeness and soundness, and empirical evaluations demonstrate its effectiveness across various environments, highlighting the importance of considering multiple states to ensure accurate learning of preconditions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- **Originality:** The work presents a novel combination of techniques and adequately cites related work.
- **Quality:** The submission is technically sound, with claims supported by discussion of limitations.
- **Clarity:** The paper is well-written, and the running example enhances understanding. The empirical results show that QACE can recover underlying models in reasonable time.
- The authors provide a clear explanation of how QACE can learn preconditions through the execution of capabilities in different states, effectively illustrated by specific examples.

Weaknesses:
- **Scalability Concerns:** The algorithm's performance may degrade with larger predicate spaces, impacting its applicability to complex systems.
- **Assumption of Fixed Hypotheses:** The method assumes all possible hypotheses need to be generated, which may not be feasible in real-life scenarios.
- **Limited Clarity on Learning Time:** The implications of a learning time of 20-30 minutes for users are unclear, particularly without a baseline for comparison.
- There is a lack of clarity regarding how the algorithm determines which states to consider, particularly when multiple states could lead to different outcomes.
- Important processes that support Algorithm 1's efficiency are not sufficiently detailed in the main body of the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the target audience for QACE, specifying whether it is aimed at users or robot designers. Additionally, providing a comparison against simpler baselines, such as random query generation, would enhance the evaluation. We suggest including more background information on FOND planning and PPDDL in the supplemental material to aid understanding. Furthermore, addressing the scalability of QACE for larger predicate spaces and providing insights into the convergence rate and error propagation in non-deterministic environments would strengthen the paper. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how the algorithm selects states for consideration, particularly in scenarios where multiple preconditions may apply. Lastly, including key processes that complement Algorithm 1 in the main body of the paper would enhance the completeness of the discussion and improve reproducibility for readers. Improving the readability of figures, such as using different colors in Figure 5, would also enhance presentation quality.
