### Key Points
This paper presents a new approach to recommendation systems, introducing the Top-Personalized-K Recommendation task, which allows for varying recommendation sizes tailored to individual user preferences. The authors propose the PerK framework, which utilizes calibrated interaction probabilities to maximize expected user utility. The methodology addresses the limitations of fixed-size top-K recommendations, demonstrating its effectiveness through extensive experiments across multiple datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and technically sound, with a clear motivation and a well-formulated solution.
- The PerK model is adaptable to various recommendation scenarios and integrates seamlessly with existing recommender systems.
- Comprehensive evaluations, including ablation studies and complexity analysis, validate the proposed method's efficacy, outperforming baseline models by approximately 7% across four datasets.

Weaknesses:
- Some datasets used for evaluation are based on explicit feedback, which may not be ideal for the implicit feedback task. The authors should consider using pure implicit feedback datasets.
- The selection of base recommender systems lacks justification, and the performance of the proposed model on advanced systems remains uncertain.
- The practical motivation for varying recommendation sizes may not align with real-world constraints, as business design often dictates fixed recommendation sizes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset selection by incorporating more pure implicit feedback datasets to enhance the relevance of their findings. Additionally, we suggest providing explicit justification for the choice of base recommender systems and exploring the performance of the PerK model with advanced recommendation models. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the practical implications of their approach, particularly regarding how varying recommendation sizes can be implemented in real-world applications.
