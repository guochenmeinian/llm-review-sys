### Key Points
This paper presents a method to achieve safe and unbiased outputs from a large language model (LLM) while preserving language understanding capabilities. The authors propose training the model on a self-curated dataset that pairs unsafe content with safe alternatives. They claim that this approach enables the model to generate safe content without compromising its credibility. A series of experiments demonstrate that the LLM trained using this method exhibits reduced bias compared to zero-shot and few-shot prompted models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The figures and codes are concise and clear, enhancing readability.
- A substantial number of detailed experiments are conducted, making the results easy to reproduce.
- The introduction of a novel dataset for developing safer LLMs is a significant contribution, with improved performance showcased through various evaluative metrics.

Weaknesses:
- The method, while innovative in application, does not present a completely new idea.
- The reliance on a stronger model, GPT-4 Turbo, for generating debiased text may create a bottleneck, potentially limiting generalization.
- There is a lack of comparison with previous methods, making it challenging to assess the comparative strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach.
- Limited novelty in the experiments is noted, as the core finding—that training on a combination of biased and unbiased datasets yields a less biased model—is not surprising.
- Details regarding the tested dataset are insufficient, raising concerns about the applicability of findings to real-world scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their experiments by exploring additional methodologies or datasets. It is crucial to provide comprehensive details about the tested dataset to enhance the validity of the experimental results. Additionally, we suggest that the authors compare their approach with previous methods to clarify its significance. Finally, we encourage the authors to complete the planned extensions and resubmit the paper to fully highlight the insights discovered in their work.
