### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into prompting methods for empathy style transfer using GPT-4, specifically proposing two innovative techniques: dialog-act-conditioned prompting and target prompting. The study demonstrates that dialog-act-conditioned prompting enhances empathy transfer while preserving source dialog acts, and that target prompting outperforms pairwise prompting in generating empathy. The experiments utilize the Empathetic Conversation dataset and evaluate metrics such as Transfer Length, Content Preservation, and Fluency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research addresses a critical area in natural language processing by exploring empathy style transfer.
- The proposed prompting methods show promise and are supported by extensive evaluations.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on automatic metrics for evaluating empathy is problematic, as human evaluation is essential for verifying improvements.
- The selection criteria for few-shot examples in target prompting are unclear, and the discussion surrounding factors affecting performance is poorly organized.
- The theoretical basis for distinguishing between "apathetic" and "empathetic" transfers lacks sufficient support, raising questions about its validity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the selection criteria for few-shot examples used in target prompting and provide a more organized discussion on the factors influencing performance. Additionally, we suggest that the authors include human evaluations to substantiate the effectiveness of their methods, as automatic metrics alone may not adequately capture improvements in empathy. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide theoretical support for the claims made in Section 3.1 regarding the distinct nature of empathy transfers and to clarify the arrangement of empathy styles on a continuous scale.
