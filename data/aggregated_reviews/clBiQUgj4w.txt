Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel technique called Residual Cycle Forecasting (RCF) to enhance long-term time series forecasting by modeling periodic cycles with learnable parameters. The authors propose CycleNet, which integrates RCF into a simple, single-channel modeling method utilizing a linear layer or shallow MLP as its backbone. CycleNet achieves significant improvements in forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency across various domains, demonstrating state-of-the-art results while reducing parameter quantity by over 90%. The authors emphasize that RCF contributes to a 28% improvement in MSE and a 16% improvement in MAE for CycleNet, and further boosts the performance of powerful models like iTransformer. However, the authors acknowledge that independent channel modeling methods may struggle in spatiotemporal contexts, necessitating advanced multichannel techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is simple, effective, and easily integrable into existing models, improving accuracy and parameter efficiency.
- CycleNet achieves competitive performance with low computational cost, validating the effectiveness of RCF.
- The paper is well-written, with clear problem definition and analysis.
- High-quality experiments provide extensive analysis, with results consistent with prior work and limitations clearly stated.
- The authors expose code and provide detailed descriptions, enhancing reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- Notations are inconsistent, particularly regarding instance normalization.
- The introduction lacks rigorous experimental support for the relationship between long-term prediction and periodic information.
- The paper does not adequately compare CycleNet with relevant baselines, such as RLinear and SparseTSF, and fails to explore its performance on datasets without obvious periodicity.
- CycleNet's performance is limited in traffic scenarios due to the challenges of independent channel modeling.
- Section 3 lacks clarity and detail, particularly regarding Learnable Recurrent Cycles.
- The initial submission lacked full results, which could hinder reader understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the consistency of notations throughout the paper, particularly for instance normalization. Additionally, the authors should provide experimental support for the claims made in the introduction regarding periodic information's relevance to long-term forecasting. A more comprehensive comparison with relevant baselines, including RLinear and SparseTSF, is necessary to position CycleNet accurately. Furthermore, we suggest reorganizing Section 3 to enhance clarity and detail regarding Learnable Recurrent Cycles. It would also be beneficial to improve the clarity of the limitations and future work sections by elaborating on the challenges faced in spatiotemporal scenarios. Please ensure that all experimental results, including those from other datasets, are included in the final paper to provide a complete understanding of the proposal. Finally, mentioning existing reproducibility issues with LD in the revised manuscript would be crucial for future readers.
