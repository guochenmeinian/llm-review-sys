### Key Points
This paper presents a study on temporal conformity bias and proposes a new method utilizing a Hawkes graph neural network to address this issue. The authors aim to disentangle user preferences from conformity influences in sequential recommendation systems. The evaluation includes extensive experiments to validate the proposed method's effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The work addresses an important problem in recommendation systems.
2. The proposed debiasing method leveraging the Hawkes process is both interesting and reasonable.
3. The paper is well-written, with a clear connection between the model abstractions and theoretical background.
4. Extensive experiments validate the proposal, covering relevant baselines and significance analysis.

Weaknesses:
1. Important related work is missing, particularly studies that disentangle popularity bias into static item quality and temporal conformity effects. The authors should explicitly discuss the differences with these works and consider them as baselines in their experiments.
2. The choice of employing a contrastive loss instead of a specific log-likelihood loss for the Hawkes process model lacks justification and should be discussed.
3. The evaluation metrics used, primarily precision-based (NDCG), do not align with the goal of disentangling personal preferences from external influences.
4. The complexity of the proposed model includes choices that are not well-supported, such as the rationale behind the three user types mentioned.
5. The datasets chosen do not adequately reflect user interaction levels, which are crucial for understanding peer pressure dynamics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related work by including significant studies on group recommendation systems and emotional contagion. Additionally, the authors should justify the use of contrastive loss in their model and consider alternative evaluation metrics that align better with their objectives. Clarifying the rationale behind the model's complexity and the chosen datasets, particularly regarding user interaction, would enhance the paper's clarity. Lastly, addressing concerns about the originality and creativity of the work is essential to strengthen the paper's credibility.
