### Key Points
This paper presents the RULE dataset, which consists of reading comprehension questions derived from the ReClor dataset, along with new follow-up questions aimed at understanding the rationale behind selected responses. The authors demonstrate the limitations of existing language models in discerning why incorrect answers should be eliminated. They benchmark various models on both the ReClor and RULE datasets, revealing that models struggle significantly with selecting the rationale for incorrect choices.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The RULE dataset is a valuable resource for future research, particularly in enhancing language models' reasoning abilities.
- The study is well-motivated, with a solid experimental design and high-quality annotations validated by humans.
- The paper provides insightful analysis on the challenges posed by eliminative subquestions and the comparative performance of models.

Weaknesses:
- The licensing status of the RULE dataset remains unclear, despite clarifications regarding the ReClor dataset.
- Some sub-questions in the dataset may be difficult to parse, and there are concerns about the potential for semantically similar rationales that differ only in expression.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the sub-questions in Figure 1 by exploring alternative phrasings to enhance comprehension. Additionally, we suggest that the authors address the potential issue of semantically similar rationales in the annotation process to ensure the integrity of the dataset. It would also be beneficial to include examples comparing specific and unspecific samples in the rationale writing section. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide clearer information regarding the licensing of the RULE dataset to facilitate its use by other researchers.
