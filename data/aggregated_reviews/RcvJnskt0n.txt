Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework called PsyEx for detecting multiple mental disorders from social media posts, specifically Reddit. The authors propose a two-stream architecture that integrates symptom-based screening with psychiatric knowledge, evaluated on a large-scale dataset. The results indicate that this approach outperforms several baseline models, particularly in detecting rarer mental disorders.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach is innovative, addressing the simultaneous occurrence of multiple mental disorders and incorporating domain knowledge for enhanced interpretability.
- The two-stream architecture significantly improves detection performance, especially for rarer diseases.
- The model demonstrates superior performance compared to strong existing baselines, including ChatGPT.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation is limited to a single dataset, which may not represent the general population.
- There is a lack of detailed discussion on model explainability, leaving its inner workings unclear.
- The paper does not provide sufficient information on practical parameter settings.
- Multiple state-of-the-art fine-tuned models were not included in the experiments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by validating the framework on additional datasets. Additionally, we suggest that the authors enhance the explainability of the model by providing a detailed discussion of how predictions are made. It would also be beneficial to include more information on practical parameter settings. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to incorporate results from multiple state-of-the-art models, such as Mental-BERT and Depression-RoBERTa, in their experiments. Lastly, adding a paragraph to describe the experimental design and including more technical details in Figure 2 would strengthen the paper.
