### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Pathological Graph-driven Cross-modal Alignment (PGCA) model for Brain CT report generation. The main contributions include the introduction of a framework that captures detailed domain knowledge from a Pathological Graph, enabling fine-grained alignment of visual and textual features. It also decouples cranial tissues and lesions, a first in medical report generation, allowing for effective alignment between long-text reports and multiple scans. The model is validated on the BCT-CHR dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to previous methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The Pathological Graph is a novel contribution that enhances model interpretability and performance.
- The paper is well-written, with clear figures and examples that facilitate understanding.
- The graph-assisted multimodal training approach is innovative, allowing for effective intra-attribute and inter-attribute alignment.
- Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art models highlight the model's advantages.

Weaknesses:
- The validation is limited to a single dataset, BCT-CHR, which restricts the paper's broader applicability.
- There is only one comparison method from two years ago, raising concerns about the comprehensiveness of the experimental validation.
- The contribution of the Pathological Graph updating process is not clearly articulated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental validation by including additional datasets to enhance the generalizability of their findings. Clarifying the contribution of the Pathological Graph updating process would strengthen the paper. Additionally, addressing the questions regarding the construction of edge probabilities, the relationship between the ground truth report and generative loss, and the clarity of loss coefficients would enhance the paper's rigor. Finally, consider discussing the potential for sampling regimes to address high-frequency term overrepresentation in the evaluation metrics.
