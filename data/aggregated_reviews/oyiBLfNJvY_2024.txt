Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents LEADS, a novel skill-based exploration method that utilizes successor states to enhance exploration in learning diverse skills. The authors argue that traditional mutual information objectives are inadequate for promoting exploration and propose a new objective that encourages state space coverage. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LEADS outperforms existing intrinsic motivation methods and other skill diversity exploration techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The presentation of the paper is excellent, making it easy to read and follow.
- The authors effectively motivate their work and build upon existing literature to derive their method.
- The experiments are thorough, including ablation studies and failure case analyses.

Weaknesses:
- The initial 2-D environment used for testing is overly simplistic; more complex environments would better showcase LEADS's capabilities.
- There is a lack of clarity regarding the mathematical precision in the derivation of the objective, particularly in Section 3.
- The statistical analysis methods employed, such as the t-test and sample standard deviation, are inappropriate for the comparisons made.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the mathematical precision in Section 3 by clearly defining measures and ensuring consistent notation. Additionally, we suggest providing a brief introduction to the baseline methods in the experimental section to clarify the differences between LEADS and these methods. It would also be beneficial to explore LEADS's performance in more complex environments and with varying numbers of skills to assess its robustness and adaptability. Finally, we advise using more appropriate statistical methods, such as paired t-tests or confidence intervals, to substantiate claims regarding performance comparisons.
