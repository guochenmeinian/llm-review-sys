Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents LE3D, an HDR 3D Gaussian Splatting method that incorporates Cone Scatter Initialization, a Color MLP, and depth distortion to enhance scene structure accuracy. The authors propose Cone Scatter Initialization to improve SfM estimations, while the Color MLP is intended to represent the RAW linear color space. The method aims to facilitate accurate scene recovery in low-light environments and enables HDR rendering and refocusing. Experimental results indicate that LE3D achieves promising outcomes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation for the paper is strong, addressing the importance of nighttime and HDR 3D Gaussian Splatting.
2. The proposed method includes comprehensive experiments that are easy to follow.
3. The supplementary video demo effectively showcases the method's capabilities.
4. The paper is well organized and clearly structured, making it accessible.

Weaknesses:
1. The necessity of Cone Scatter Initialization is questioned, as initial point clouds may be optimized during the 3DGS training stage. The authors should provide ablation studies using the RawNeRF dataset.
2. Concerns arise regarding the ability to obtain initial SfM estimations from very dark inputs, as indicated by examples in the paper.
3. The claim that spherical harmonics (SH) inadequately represent HDR color information lacks solid evidence and requires further justification.
4. The similarity between the proposed depth distortion and that of Mip-NeRF 360 raises questions about their differences; comparative experiments should be conducted.
5. The authors may overstate the advantages of their method regarding training speed, which is primarily attributed to 3DGS itself rather than the proposed components.
6. Quantitative results from ablation studies are insufficiently presented.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the importance of Cone Scatter Initialization by conducting ablation studies with the RawNeRF dataset. Additionally, the authors should clarify how initial SfM estimations are derived from dark inputs and provide solid evidence for the limitations of SH in representing HDR color information. We suggest conducting experiments to compare the proposed depth distortion with that of Mip-NeRF 360. Furthermore, the authors should avoid overstating the training speed advantages and include quantitative results from the ablation studies in the paper. Lastly, a thorough spell check is advised to correct any remaining typos and grammatical errors.
