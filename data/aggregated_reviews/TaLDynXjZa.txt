### Key Points
This paper presents a study on detecting drowsiness through eye movements using deep neural sequence models, demonstrating that predicting impending microsleep is more accurate than self-assessment or reaction time. The authors assemble a dataset of 47 patients, which is publicly available along with the code, and conduct extensive ablation studies and post-hoc SHAPLEY investigations. The contribution of a new dataset, particularly with the PVT and KSS data, is significant for advancing research in this area.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The relevance of eye gaze measurements for drowsiness detection is well-motivated, with clear connections to prior literature.
- The open-source release of the dataset and code is a valuable resource for the research community.
- Comprehensive ablation studies and feature investigations enhance the analysis.

Weaknesses:
- The choice of a classification task based on the KSS distribution rather than a regression or ordinal regression setup lacks justification and requires further discussion.
- The hyper-parameter tuning process raises concerns about potential data leakage, as it appears only one fold was used for selection in a nested cross-validation setup.
- The reporting of only AU-ROC in the presence of potential class imbalance is insufficient; more robust measures such as AU-PRC, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-Score should be included.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for selecting a classification task based on the KSS distribution and consider discussing the implications of this choice. Additionally, please clarify the hyper-parameter tuning process to ensure it aligns with a true nested setup to avoid data leakage. Finally, we suggest including a comprehensive table of results that encompasses sensitivity, specificity, and F1-Score to provide a more robust evaluation of model performance.
