### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on automatic pronunciation assessment, covering two decades of research. It discusses error types, training and evaluation datasets, and the evolution of assessment methods from HMM-based likelihood measures to modern self-supervised models. The authors claim contributions include revisiting literature, reviewing qualitative studies on intelligibility and accent, and suggesting future work.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is clearly written and well-structured, serving as a valuable introduction for newcomers to the field.
- It provides a focused survey of published work and useful information on available datasets.
- The presentation of modeling approaches and descriptive figures is clear and informative.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks originality, presenting no new methods or data.
- It requires extensive familiarity with recent work in acoustic modeling, making it less accessible to a broader audience.
- Key discussions, such as challenges and future directions, are addressed only briefly and lack depth.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the target audience and provide more background information for readers unfamiliar with the field. Expanding the section on evaluation metrics to include quantitative evidence on prevalent metrics would enhance the paper's utility. Additionally, we suggest defining acronyms and ensuring that all technical terms are adequately explained. Addressing formatting errors and improving the bibliography would also enhance the overall presentation.
