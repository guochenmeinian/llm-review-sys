### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of entity alignment (EA) methods in the context of highly heterogeneous knowledge graphs (HHKGs). The authors identify the limitations of current datasets, which oversimplify heterogeneity, and propose two new HHKG datasets that better reflect real-world scenarios. They also introduce a novel EA method called Simple-HHEA and evaluate existing EA methods on these datasets, revealing significant insights into their limitations, particularly for graph neural network (GNN)-based approaches. The paper is well-structured and includes a dedicated GitHub repository for analysis and results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively identifies a gap in existing research by addressing oversimplified heterogeneity in current datasets.
- The introduction of new HHKG datasets and the evaluation of representative EA methods provide valuable insights.
- The abstract succinctly communicates the motivation and key findings of the study.

Weaknesses:
- The primary contribution of the paper is not clearly delineated, leading to potential confusion regarding its focus.
- The conclusion lacks depth, missing an opportunity to discuss broader implications and future research directions.
- Several typos and grammatical errors are present in the first half of the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the primary contribution by revising the title and structure of the paper to explicitly convey the focus on new datasets, experiments, and the Simple-HHEA method. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the conclusion with a deeper discussion of the implications of the observed limitations and providing recommendations for future research directions. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to proofread the paper to correct the identified typos and grammatical errors. Lastly, we recommend including more practical real examples to clarify the discussed concepts.
