### Key Points
This paper presents a method to enhance the simulation of quantum circuits by integrating graph neural networks (GNNs) and reinforcement learning (RL) with the ZX-calculus framework. The authors demonstrate that their approach achieves superior simulation efficiency for specific quantum circuit classes, particularly those that are challenging to simulate classically.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- **Innovative Integration**: The combination of GNNs and RL to address quantum circuit simulation is highly innovative, leveraging modern AI techniques in a mathematically intensive domain.  
- **Use of ZX-Calculus**: The ZX-calculus provides a robust mathematical framework for representing quantum circuits as graphs, facilitating the application of AI methods.  
- **Performance Gains**: The results show significant efficiency improvements, including reduced stabilizer terms and enhanced decomposition metrics.  
- **Thorough Experimental Setup**: The experiments utilize both real-world quantum circuits and randomly generated structures, offering a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.

Weaknesses:  
- **Limited Exploration of Practical Applications**: The paper lacks a detailed discussion on the practical implications of the improvements for real-world quantum computing tasks.  
- **Complexity of GNN and RL Setup**: The technical descriptions may be too dense for non-experts, necessitating clearer explanations or visualizations to enhance accessibility.  
- **Scalability Considerations**: There is insufficient discussion on how the method scales with larger quantum circuits, which is crucial for assessing its applicability compared to other simulation techniques.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- **Real-World Use Cases**: We recommend that the authors incorporate examples of practical applications for this method in quantum computing, including comparisons with existing simulators.  
- **Model Interpretability**: To broaden accessibility, we suggest including additional interpretative explanations, visualizations, or simplified descriptions of the model's architecture and RL setup.  
- **Scalability and Efficiency**: We recommend providing a more detailed analysis of the scalability of the proposed method, particularly for larger circuits, to evaluate its feasibility for complex quantum systems.  
- **Introduction to ZX-Calculus**: Including a more comprehensive introduction to ZX-calculus in the appendix would enhance the paper's self-containment and clarity.
