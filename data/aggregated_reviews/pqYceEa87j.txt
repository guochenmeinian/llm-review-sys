Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Spectral Editing of Activations (SEA), a method designed to enhance the alignment of large language models (LLMs) by improving truthfulness and reducing bias during inference without requiring training. SEA utilizes singular value decomposition (SVD) to identify projection directions that maximize correlation with positive (truthful) examples while minimizing correlation with negative (biased) examples. The authors demonstrate SEA's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks, including TruthfulQA and BBQ, showing consistent improvements in performance across various LLMs with minimal impact on other capabilities and an increase in inference speed.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant issue in LLMs, focusing on enhancing truthfulness and reducing bias.
- SEA outperforms existing methods while maintaining a better inference speed.
- The experimental design is robust, evaluating the method across various benchmarks and LLM architectures.
- The paper is well-written and presents the methodology clearly.

Weaknesses:
- There is no significance testing for benchmark scores, particularly for TruthfulQA, where reported differences may be insignificant.
- The evaluation could benefit from additional benchmarks for bias and truthfulness.
- Some result selections appear arbitrary, raising concerns about generalizability.
- The reported toxigen scores for Llama2-chat-7B are unexpectedly high compared to previous reports.
- The scalability of SEA for simultaneous improvements in truthfulness and bias remains unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the rigor of their significance testing for benchmark scores, particularly for TruthfulQA, to address potential insignificance in reported differences. Additionally, including more evaluation benchmarks for bias and truthfulness would strengthen the paper. Clarifying the rationale behind result selections and addressing the high toxigen scores for Llama2-chat-7B would enhance credibility. Furthermore, we suggest exploring whether different editing projections are necessary for achieving both truthfulness and bias reduction simultaneously. Lastly, providing visualizations of activation distribution shifts before and after applying SEA could offer deeper insights into the method's impact.
