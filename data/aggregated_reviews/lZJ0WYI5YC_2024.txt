Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comparative analysis of classical optimization and learning-based methods for medical image registration, proposing a general recipe for selecting the appropriate paradigm based on specific registration problems. The authors investigate the correlation between mutual information and the performance of registration methods, concluding that while supervised learning methods enhance label matching, unsupervised methods do not yield improvements. The study also highlights the limited generalizability of learning-based methods across datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation behind the work is clear, providing valuable insights into a complex topic.
2. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on various classical and deep learning-based registration models across multiple datasets.
3. The results challenge existing claims regarding the efficacy of unsupervised learning methods in label matching.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks new solutions or deeper insights, with some findings appearing trivial, such as the superiority of supervised methods.
2. The relevance of findings in Sections 4, 5, and 6 is unclear, and the authors do not adequately address future research directions for unsupervised or supervised deep learning image registration (DLIR) methods.
3. The training set for deep learning models is insufficient, potentially skewing comparisons with classical models.
4. The paper's conclusions are overly broad, lacking validation across diverse registration tasks and datasets beyond brain MRI.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and depth of their findings by addressing the following:
1. Expand experiments to include a wider range of datasets and registration tasks, including intra-subject and atlas-based registrations, to strengthen their claims.
2. Provide a more detailed discussion on the performance discrepancies of the models compared to original studies, including implementation details and hyperparameter setups.
3. Clarify the implications of their findings and future research directions, particularly regarding the limitations of unsupervised DLIR methods.
4. Enhance the presentation by focusing on the core contributions and reducing redundancy in implementation details to improve overall readability.
