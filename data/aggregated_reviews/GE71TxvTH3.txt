### Key Points
This paper presents a novel LLM sequential recommender system based on a dual dynamic index mechanism, integrating an indexer and a sequential recommender into a unified framework. The dual architecture consists of two homogeneous discrete index generators for user and item indexing, enabling LLMs to leverage high-order user-item interaction patterns. The authors propose an end-to-end dual dynamic (ED2) recommender system that includes a multi-grained token regulator (m-GTR) and instruction tuning tasks. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving significant improvements in recommendation metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and easy to understand.
2. The motivation for the proposed dynamic indexing mechanism is clear and novel compared to static methods.
3. The integration of semantic and collaborative information addresses critical limitations in existing LLM-based recommenders.
4. Extensive experiments show substantial performance gains, with ED2 achieving an average improvement of 19.62% in Hit-Rate and 21.11% in NDCG.

Weaknesses:
1. The method is limited to llama-based sequential recommendations and requires dynamic indexing for every iteration, affecting efficiency.
2. The datasets used in experiments have similar sparsity and average length, which may not adequately represent diverse user interactions.
3. Some implementation details, particularly in Subsection 2.4, are lacking, raising questions about the selection process for user interactions.
4. The framework is complex and may introduce higher computational overhead, with insufficient details on overall computational costs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the applicability of the proposed indexing method to other recommendation settings, such as collaborative filtering. Additionally, we suggest exploring the impact of user interaction sequence length on the performance of ED2. The authors should provide more detailed implementation information in Subsection 2.4, particularly regarding user selection for generating indices. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the computational complexity and provide a comprehensive analysis of the overall computational costs associated with the framework. Lastly, including a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of ED2 in avoiding semantic overlap issues would strengthen the motivation for the proposed approach.
