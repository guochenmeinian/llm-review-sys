Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical framework for analyzing data corruption in machine learning using Markov kernels. The authors propose a new taxonomy of corruptions based on their dependence on feature and label spaces, aiming to unify various corruption models. They derive corrected loss functions for different types of corruptions and discuss implications for supervised learning, although the paper lacks empirical contributions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a comprehensive framework that systematically categorizes corruptions, potentially aiding future research.
- The authors' taxonomy is organized hierarchically, providing a foundational understanding of complex corruptions.
- The derived loss correction formulas may improve the performance of machine learning algorithms in the presence of corruptions.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clear practical implications and concrete examples, making it difficult to appreciate its contributions.
- The theoretical discussions require further clarification, particularly regarding the assumptions and their practical implications.
- There is no empirical validation of the theoretical findings, which is a significant concern for the paper's rigor and applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the practical implications of their theoretical framework, particularly how it can inform the development of principled methods for learning under corruption. It would be beneficial to provide concrete examples illustrating the implementation of the corrected loss function, such as its application in cross-entropy loss under label noise. Additionally, including experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the derived loss functions would strengthen the submission. Clarifying the assumptions made in the theoretical discussions and their implications for real-world scenarios is essential for enhancing the rigor of the results. Finally, addressing how the proposed model connects to existing corruption instances and modern data distribution shifts would provide valuable insights for practitioners.
