### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of the nablaDFT dataset, introducing a comprehensive dataset and benchmark that includes a significant increase in molecular structures, conformations, and additional tasks for model evaluation. The dataset encompasses over 30 quantum chemistry properties, including energies, forces, Hamiltonians, overlap matrices, and wavefunction objects, aimed at enhancing molecular property prediction and conformational optimization. The authors propose a novel benchmark for evaluating neural network potentials (NNPs) and emphasize the relevance of Hamiltonian prediction in computational chemistry, particularly for drug discovery.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is extensive, featuring a universal collection of over 30 quantum chemistry properties and a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating quantum chemistry models.
- The manuscript is well written, providing clear comparisons with related datasets and benchmarks, and the benchmark tasks are motivated by real-world requirements.
- The authors present a robust framework that includes adaptations of multiple quantum chemistry models along with benchmark metrics and checkpoints.

Weaknesses:
- The benchmark for geometry optimization lacks recent works, such as equiformerV2, and the evaluation of final conformations may be more informative if based on DFT energy comparisons rather than RMSD.
- The authors should consider providing a Jupyter notebook for users to demonstrate the end-to-end process of loading, processing, training, and evaluating the model.
- There are inconsistencies in the reported results for QHNet compared to PhisNet, and the full Hamiltonian dataset is not available for download on GitHub.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the benchmark by including more recent works, such as equiformerV2, and consider using DFT energy comparisons for evaluating conformational stability. Additionally, providing a Jupyter notebook would facilitate user engagement with the dataset. It would also be beneficial to address the discrepancies in QHNet results and ensure that the full Hamiltonian dataset is accessible on GitHub. Lastly, the authors should clarify the necessity of training ML models for predicting the overlap matrix and explore the adequacy of geometry optimization without fine-tuning on DFT trajectories.
