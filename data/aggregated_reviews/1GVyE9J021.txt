### Key Points
This paper presents a domain adaptation framework for entity matching, focusing on distinguishing common features across domains from domain-specific features to reduce model confusion. The authors propose two architectures, MFSN and MFSN-FRSE, which utilize BERT-based encoders and decoders to learn both shared and private features. The reported results indicate a 7% average improvement in F1 score over previous state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses the significant issue of entity matching with unlabeled data, which is often overlooked in supervised approaches.
- The experimental setup is comprehensive, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method across 12 tasks.
- The clarity of the training phase enhances understanding and reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks situational relevance to web applications, and the use of older language models like BERT is not adequately justified.
- There is insufficient explanation regarding the inference process for target datasets and the additional training data used for adapted models.
- The novelty of the method is questionable, as it closely resembles existing frameworks, and the analyses provided are limited.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for using older language models and clarify the amount of extra training data utilized during adaptation. Additionally, a detailed explanation of the inference process for applying the model to new datasets should be included. To enhance the paper's rigor, proper references should be provided for claims made in Section 3.3 and for DomAtt in Section 3.6. Finally, sharing the code would significantly improve the replicability of this work.
