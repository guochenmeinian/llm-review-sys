Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper addresses the challenge of parameter estimation in softmax gating Gaussian mixture of experts by identifying three theoretical challenges: (i) non-uniqueness of parameter estimation, (ii) interaction between softmax gating and expert functions, and (iii) complex dependence in the conditional density. The authors propose Voronoi loss functions to tackle these issues and establish convergence rates for the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). They also connect the MLE rate to a solvability problem of polynomial equations when the number of experts is unknown or over-specified.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper presents a novel solution to a significant problem in the literature, addressing fundamental challenges associated with softmax gating. By introducing Voronoi loss functions and establishing convergence rates for the MLE, the authors provide a fresh perspective on parameter estimation. The paper enhances theoretical understanding and establishes a connection between MLE rates and polynomial equation solvability, highlighting relationships between statistical estimation and mathematical problem-solving.

Weaknesses:  
The absence of a comparison with popular techniques such as Gumbel-softmax and max-propagate limits the paper's completeness. Additionally, the lack of experimental validation raises concerns about the practical relevance of the proposed methods, making it difficult to assess their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. The paper's exposition could be improved for accessibility, and the significance of the results is somewhat diminished due to the lack of empirical verification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including a comparison or discussion of popular techniques like Gumbel-softmax and max-propagate to enhance completeness. Additionally, we suggest incorporating empirical validation to demonstrate the practical relevance and effectiveness of the proposed methods. To improve accessibility, consider revising the exposition to clarify complex technical details and potentially include diagrams to aid understanding. Lastly, we encourage the authors to connect their theoretical findings more closely to practical applications, possibly through toy examples that illustrate the significance of their results.
