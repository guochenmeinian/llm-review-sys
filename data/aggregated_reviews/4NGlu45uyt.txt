Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of the Procrustes-Wasserstein problem, focusing on aligning two high-dimensional point clouds, where one is a noisy version of the other under orthogonal transformation. The authors derive information-theoretic results for both high and low dimensional regimes and propose a "Ping-Pong algorithm" that estimates the orthogonal transformation and matching. The theoretical findings are supported by numerical experiments, demonstrating the algorithm's advantages over existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors derive upper and lower bounds for the maximum likelihood estimator in the Procrustes-Wasserstein problem across different dimensional regimes.
- The proposed Ping-Pong algorithm shows empirical advantages over other baseline algorithms, including those by Grave et al. (2019).

Weaknesses:
- The title may mislead readers regarding its connection to random graphs.
- The motivation for the problem is inadequately elaborated, particularly the significance of considering point clouds generated from a Gaussian distribution.
- The advantages of the Ping-Pong algorithm over Grave et al.'s method are not sufficiently clarified, necessitating deeper analysis and empirical evidence.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the title to better reflect the paper's content and its relation to random graphs. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on the motivation behind the Procrustes-Wasserstein problem, specifically addressing why it is significant to study point clouds from a Gaussian distribution. To enhance clarity, we suggest providing a more detailed comparison of the Ping-Pong algorithm with Grave et al.'s method, including rigorous empirical evidence, particularly with larger datasets. Furthermore, addressing the initialization problem of the non-convex Procrustes-Wasserstein problem and clarifying the importance of the one-step analysis in the context of non-convex optimization would strengthen the paper.
