### Key Points
This paper presents **GL2GPU**, an intermediate layer that dynamically translates WebGL applications to WebGPU at runtime, aiming to enhance rendering performance. The authors detail the design and implementation of GL2GPU, utilizing techniques such as JavaScript prototype patching, state caching, and render bundle management to address the discrepancies between WebGL and WebGPU. The work is significant as it allows developers to leverage WebGPU's advantages without rewriting existing WebGL code, potentially bridging the performance gap in web graphics rendering.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- High-quality research with clear exposition of technical details and experimental results.
- Demonstrates impressive performance improvements, including a **45.05% reduction in average frame time**.
- Provides a solid implementation with open-sourced code and a comprehensive evaluation across diverse devices and browsers.

Weaknesses:
- Introduces additional complexity to the rendering pipeline, complicating maintenance and debugging.
- The design details in Section 3 are straightforward and lack depth, particularly regarding cache design and bundle management.
- The framework may lead to increased CPU and memory usage, raising concerns about performance in resource-constrained environments.
- Compatibility issues with certain browsers indicate the need for extensive cross-platform testing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the overhead introduced by dynamic translation, including specific measurements of application startup performance. Additionally, the authors should compare GL2GPU with native WebGPU implementations to provide context for its performance benefits. Elaborating on the cache design, including eviction and prefetching strategies, would enhance understanding of its effectiveness. Finally, addressing the limitations of GL2GPU in handling WebGL features or extensions not supported by WebGPU would strengthen the paper's contributions.
