Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents COMPASS, a reinforcement learning-based framework designed to learn a diversified neural solver for combinatorial optimization problems. It utilizes a continuous latent search space to fine-tune a pre-trained neural constructive model (such as POMO) by sampling vectors that condition the model's parameters. The method employs Covariance Matrix Adaptation (CMA-ES) during inference to optimize performance for individual test instances without the need for retraining. The authors provide a detailed analysis of various construction methods in reinforcement learning, addressing challenges faced by existing methods like POMO and Poppy. They assert that COMPASS effectively integrates training and search procedures, enhancing solution quality through limited rollout episodes. The experiments demonstrate that COMPASS achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark instances of the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The concept of learning a latent search space for fine-tuning parameters is novel and could positively impact the neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) community.
- The authors conducted comprehensive experiments with detailed tables and visualizations, showing COMPASS's competitive performance.
- The method demonstrates shorter inference times and potential for generalization to out-of-training distribution instances.
- The authors provide a nuanced discussion of the limitations of existing methods and the rationale behind COMPASS.
- They offer empirical evidence supporting their claims regarding the efficiency of their implementation, particularly in comparison to EAS and POMO.
- The authors demonstrate a willingness to adapt their presentation based on reviewer feedback, indicating responsiveness to constructive criticism.

Weaknesses:
- The inference time is not included in the experimental results, which is crucial for understanding COMPASS's performance.
- The experimental results do not convincingly establish COMPASS as state-of-the-art when compared to methods like EAS, SGBS+EAS, and DPDP.
- The model structure, training method, and inference process lack sufficient detail, making it difficult to replicate or fully understand the approach.
- The literature review is not comprehensive, missing significant works that could provide context and comparison for COMPASS.
- The paper lacks a comprehensive presentation of results with and without augmentations in the main text, which could enhance clarity and understanding.
- The reported runtimes for EAS differ significantly from previous studies, raising questions about the consistency and accuracy of the implementation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the model structure, training method, and inference process by providing more detailed descriptions. Additionally, it is essential to include inference time in the experimental results to better evaluate COMPASS's performance. We suggest benchmarking COMPASS against POMO and EAS with data augmentation to provide a complete understanding of its advantages. Furthermore, the authors should enhance the literature review to include relevant works such as CVAE-Opt and SGBS, and clarify the differences between COMPASS and similar methods. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their results by including a single table in the main paper that presents both results with and without augmentation. This would provide readers with a more comprehensive understanding of the performance of different methods. Lastly, we suggest that the authors consider explicitly highlighting how COMPASS outperforms other methods that utilize augmentation, as this would further strengthen their key message regarding state-of-the-art performance without reliance on augmentations.
