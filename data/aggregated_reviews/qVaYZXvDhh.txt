### Key Points
This paper presents an observational study of Brazilian political discussions on Twitter, analyzing a dataset of 437 million tweets from 2018 to 2023 across two presidential elections. The authors investigate user behavior, bot accounts, and interaction patterns, revealing trends in replies and bot activity. While the study is methodologically robust and provides a significant longitudinal case study, the novelty and insights are limited, particularly regarding the implications for dismantling coordinated campaigns.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Robust methodology and extensive dataset.
- Relevant theme addressing an under-explored phenomenon in Brazilian politics.
- Quality and clarity of presentation, with thorough contextual understanding of the electoral process.

Weaknesses:
- Limited originality and technical contribution; insights are not particularly instrumental.
- Some analyses lack depth and coherence, with disconnected discussions.
- Insufficient exploration of bot strategies and their countermeasures; potential biases in data collection need addressing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper's focus and enhance the discussion surrounding the implications of their findings. Specifically, we suggest elaborating on the rationale behind users exiting conversations and clarifying the definitions of suspicious users and bot accounts. Additionally, integrating a section on related work early in the paper would contextualize the study better. The authors should also investigate the effects of data collection changes on results and consider combining analyses to explore correlations between account creation and bot activity. Finally, a more detailed discussion on countermeasures against bot activities would strengthen the paper's relevance.
