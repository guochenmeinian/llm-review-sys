Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel appearance modeling technique for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that integrates normal information and incident lighting parametrization using MLPs. The authors claim to achieve competitive rendering quality while enhancing geometric detail. They conduct experiments on datasets such as MIP-NeRF360 and Tanks&Temples, providing quantitative comparisons in rendering quality and normal accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and components are clearly explained.
- Experiments utilize relevant datasets and metrics, including LPIPS, SSIM, and PSNR, to assess image quality.
- The research problem of accurate appearance and geometry reconstruction is pertinent to the active field of neural rendering.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental evaluation is limited to 3DGS methods, lacking comparisons with NeRF-based methods like Ref-NeRF, raising questions about the proposed method's competitiveness.
- The definition of normals in the context of 3D Gaussians is vague, particularly regarding overlapping or semi-transparent Gaussians.
- The authors' claim of improved geometric quality based on normal accuracy could be better supported by metrics like chamfer distance or F1-score.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental evaluation by including comparisons to NeRF-based methods to address the competitiveness of their approach. Additionally, clarifying the definition of normals in overlapping scenarios would enhance understanding. We suggest incorporating established metrics for geometric quality, such as chamfer distance, to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method's performance.
