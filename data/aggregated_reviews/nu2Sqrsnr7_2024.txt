Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an approach to solving the acoustic wave equation using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The authors propose a method that enforces boundary and initial conditions through continuous functions within the PINN framework and introduce a Dynamic Amplitude-Focused Sampling (DAFS) technique to enhance training efficiency. The manuscript primarily focuses on the one-dimensional wave equation, discussing the imposition of conditions and a quadrature scheme based on finite difference discretization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an interesting problem in acoustics and applies PINN techniques effectively.
- The imposition of the time derivative appears to be a novel construction.
- The evaluation of candidate functions for \(\tau\) provides valuable insights.

Weaknesses:
- The manuscript lacks coherence and feels like a collection of existing techniques rather than a novel framework.
- The focus on the one-dimensional wave equation limits the generalizability of the findings.
- The experimental section is incomplete, lacking comparisons with other point selection algorithms and relative error metrics.
- The clarity of the domain decomposition framework is insufficient, and training details are not adequately provided.
- Numerous typos and grammar errors detract from the overall quality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the coherence of the manuscript by integrating the various techniques into a unified framework rather than presenting them as isolated methods. It would be beneficial to extend the application of their methods beyond the one-dimensional wave equation to demonstrate broader applicability. We suggest conducting a more comprehensive experimental comparison with other point selection algorithms, such as those in Wu et al. (2023), and providing relative error metrics for the predictions. Additionally, we advise enhancing the clarity of the domain decomposition framework and including detailed training information, such as the number of training points, optimizer, and learning rate. Lastly, we encourage the authors to proofread the manuscript to correct typos and improve overall readability.
