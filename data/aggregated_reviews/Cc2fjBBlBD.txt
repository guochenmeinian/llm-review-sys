Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for training classifiers that leverage both stable and spurious features to enhance performance in unsupervised domain adaptation. The authors propose a representation learning approach that separates these features under the complementarity assumption, allowing for effective adaptation using unlabeled data from the target domain. The main result, Theorem 4.4, establishes conditions under which domain-specific features can improve a conservative classifier reliant on stable features. The effectiveness of the proposed method, termed Stable Feature Boosting (SFB), is demonstrated through evaluations on synthetic datasets and real-world datasets like CMNIST, PACS, and Camelyon-17.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents a clear connection between theory and experiments.
- It addresses a significant problem in out-of-distribution generalization by utilizing spurious features, which is a novel approach.
- The theoretical framework provides sufficient conditions for training adaptive classifiers using unlabeled data.

Weaknesses:
- The clarity of presentation could be improved, with inconsistent notation and important details relegated to appendices.
- The assumptions in Theorem 4.4 regarding the availability of stable and unstable features are strong and may not be practically achievable.
- There is a lack of comparison with existing domain adaptation methods, which could undermine the perceived contribution of the work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by ensuring consistent notation and integrating key discussions from the appendices into the main text. Additionally, the authors should consider including comparisons with relevant domain adaptation methods to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of their approach. We also suggest conducting ablation studies to assess the impact of the new training objective function and clarifying how the stability and complementarity conditions are enforced in practice. Finally, addressing the limitations related to the extraction of stable and unstable features would strengthen the paper's contributions.
