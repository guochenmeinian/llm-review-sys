### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of ChatGPT's performance on health-related questions from the TREC Misinformation dataset, focusing on its responses with and without evidence. The authors investigate how different prompts influence ChatGPT's ability to provide accurate health information, highlighting the model's sensitivity to question phrasing and the potential negative impact of provided evidence. The study aims to deepen understanding of ChatGPT's behavior in the healthcare domain.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses critical issues regarding ChatGPT's behavior and its implications for health information.
- It includes well-argued decisions, detailed procedures, and multiple experiments.
- The work contributes valuable insights into the functioning of state-of-the-art LLMs in healthcare.

Weaknesses:
- There is a lack of in-depth analysis regarding the influence of evidence on ChatGPT's responses.
- The validation of the proposed methods is insufficient, with concerns about testing robustness and clarity in the prompting approach.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the influence of evidence on ChatGPT's responses by including statistical evaluations. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the prompting architecture and ensure robust validation to avoid overestimating the method's effectiveness. Clarifying the evaluation process for Yes vs. No type questions and addressing the limitations related to multiple talk turns would also enhance the manuscript. Lastly, we suggest adding a figure to illustrate the workflow and extending the related work section for better context.
