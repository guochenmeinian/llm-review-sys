Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the $H_\infty$ control problem, focusing on solving it through zero-th-order policy optimization. The authors propose a derivative-free policy optimization algorithm and provide sample complexity bounds for both exact and inexact oracle settings. The theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations, demonstrating the algorithm's effectiveness compared to model-based approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and addresses the challenging $H_\infty$ control problem, which is of significant interest to the learning-in-control community.
- It provides the first non-asymptotic sample complexity results in the literature for this problem.
- The use of randomized smoothing techniques to derive sample complexity bounds is noteworthy.

Weaknesses:
- The related work section lacks structure, and the authors should clarify the major technical challenges in advancing from the global convergence results in existing literature to their sample complexity results.
- Theorems 3.7 and 4.2 present counter-intuitive results regarding the relationship between the tolerance level $v$ and the number of iterations $T$.
- The algorithm's reliance on oracle access requires more discussion, and the simulation section is insufficiently detailed, with room for improvement in the presentation quality of plots.
- The authors need to clarify their claim of a "derivative-free" approach, as the calculation of $g_t$ is necessary.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the structure of the related work section and explicitly discuss the technical challenges faced in deriving their results. Additionally, the authors should address the counter-intuitive findings in Theorems 3.7 and 4.2, and clarify the nature of the oracle used in their algorithm. Enhancing the simulation section with more detailed results and improving the quality of the plots is also advised. Finally, the authors should explain their characterization of the approach as "derivative-free" and present the best possible probability bounds in the main body of the paper.
