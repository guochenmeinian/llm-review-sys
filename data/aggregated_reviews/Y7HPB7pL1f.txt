Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an interactive deep clustering framework (IDC) that integrates user interactions to enhance clustering performance, particularly on hard samples near cluster boundaries. The authors propose a sample value evaluation criterion that combines *hardness*, *representativeness*, and *diversity* to select samples for user feedback, which is then used to fine-tune clustering models. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of IDC across five datasets and two pre-trained clustering models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses the critical issue of improving clustering performance on hard samples, which is a significant challenge in existing methods.
- The proposed method is simple, well-presented, and shows improved results in the reported metrics, although the evaluation may not be exhaustive.
- The technical soundness of IDC is supported by experiments that indicate its superiority over semi-supervised classification and clustering baselines.

Weaknesses:
- The assumption that users can provide accurate feedback is a significant limitation, particularly in complex real-world scenarios where expert input may be costly or impractical.
- The evaluation lacks clarity on how performance improvements are assessed, especially regarding hard samples that do not receive user feedback.
- Important details regarding datasets, user interaction, and the impact of sample selection strategies are insufficiently addressed, including the marginal benefits observed in certain experiments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their evaluation metrics, particularly by demonstrating performance enhancements on hard samples that did not receive user feedback. Additionally, we suggest including a performance baseline that assumes correct clustering of the 500 query samples to better illustrate the proposed method's impact. Detailed instructions on hyper-parameter tuning and analyses of parameters $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ should be provided. Furthermore, the authors should explore more sophisticated strategies for utilizing user feedback and consider the implications of potential inaccuracies in user responses. Lastly, we encourage the authors to enhance the interaction interface design to improve efficiency and provide more comprehensive details about the datasets and user feedback process.
