### Key Points
This paper presents RedCode, a benchmark designed to evaluate the safety of AI-assisted code agents in generating and executing code. RedCode comprises two components: RedCode-Exec, which assesses agents' responses to over 4,000 test cases based on critical vulnerabilities from the MITRE CWE framework, and RedCode-Gen, which tests agents’ tendencies to autonomously generate harmful software through 160 prompts. The empirical evaluation reveals vulnerabilities in current code agents, particularly in processing natural language descriptions, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced safety protocols in AI coding practices.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a crucial issue in AI-assisted coding safety.
- RedCode executes actual code, providing concrete and convincing results.
- The authors offer a thorough analysis of experimental results, revealing significant insights into agent vulnerabilities.

Weaknesses:
- The definition of the 25 Python risky scenarios lacks detail, missing potential issues like memory leaks.
- The versatility of augmenting unsafe test cases compared to seed samples is not justified.
- The method of crafting URLs with obvious risky words may not accurately reflect real-world scenarios.
- Clarifications are needed regarding the mitigation of MITRE’s Common Weakness Enumeration and the definitions of "unsafe" versus "risky."
- The correlation between coding capabilities and malware quality in the RedCode-Gen experiment lacks supporting correlation coefficients.
- A typographical error exists in Line 142.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the definition of the 25 Python risky scenarios to include a broader range of potential issues. Additionally, the authors should justify the differences and versatility of the augmenting test cases compared to the seed samples. It would be beneficial to craft URLs that more accurately reflect real-world risky data. Clarification on how MITRE’s Common Weakness Enumeration was mitigated to 13 applicable Python risky scenarios is necessary, as is a distinction between "unsafe" and "risky" in the context of automatically generated test cases. Furthermore, we suggest providing correlation coefficients, such as Kendall or Pearson, to support claims regarding the relationship between coding capabilities and malware quality. Lastly, the typo in Line 142 should be corrected.
