Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on sampling from a user's distribution under local differential privacy (LDP), focusing on the privacy-utility trade-off (PUT) characterized by f-divergence. The authors propose mechanisms that are optimal for both finite and continuous data spaces, removing the dependence on a reference distribution. They provide lower and upper bounds on achievable f-divergence and demonstrate their results through numerical evaluations, showing significant improvements over previous work.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is clearly written and presents a novel approach to analyzing the PUT in LDP sampling.
- It offers optimal mechanisms for both finite and continuous data spaces, supported by well-justified assumptions and numerical results that contextualize the theoretical findings.

Weaknesses:
- While the results are optimal, they can be viewed as generalizations of previously known results, suggesting limited originality in the algorithmic techniques.
- The motivation for the setting is somewhat unclear, as the utility of the output relies on assumptions about the relationship between users' distributions.
- The constant \( r_P \) lacks a closed form, necessitating approximate methods that may introduce errors affecting privacy or utility guarantees.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for their setting, specifically addressing why inferring a distribution poses a privacy risk. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed justification for the assumptions made in the continuous setting to enhance the understanding of their necessity. Lastly, the authors should consider discussing the implications of approximation errors in calculating \( r_P \) on the LDP guarantees more thoroughly.
