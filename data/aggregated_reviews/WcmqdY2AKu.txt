Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel topology-based graph pooling layer, TIP, which integrates persistent homology (PH) to enhance graph pooling techniques. The authors propose a method that resamples graph connections and adjusts edge weights using persistence information from one-dimensional persistence diagrams, eliminating the need for 0-dimensional features and thereby reducing computational burdens. Theorem 4.1 is central to their argument, categorizing cases for distinguishing graphs based on unique filtration values. The experimental results demonstrate that TIP effectively preserves topological features and improves performance in graph classification tasks across various datasets. The work clarifies the importance of maintaining topology in graph pooling, addressing a significant gap in existing methods. However, concerns remain regarding the clarity of proofs, particularly Proposition 1, and the implications of node features in isomorphic graphs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a new and interesting approach to retaining phase information in the pooling layer.
- Experimental evidence supports the effectiveness of the proposed method in preserving topological features and improving performance.
- The integration of PH into graph pooling is a novel contribution that aligns well with existing frameworks.
- The authors acknowledge and address reviewer concerns, indicating a willingness to improve clarity and rigor in their proofs.
- The proposed method of using self-loops in persistence diagrams is innovative and aims to enhance computational efficiency.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical relevance of Theorem 4.1 is questionable, as it relies on 1-dimensional topological features that may not be as expressive as the 1-WL test.
- The proof of Theorem 4.1 is considered unclear, with reviewers questioning the necessity of self-loops and the implications for isomorphic graphs.
- The novelty of the method is limited, as similar concepts have been explored in prior works without adequate acknowledgment.
- The paper lacks consistent definitions and clarity regarding the filtration function's domain, leading to confusion about its application.
- The experiments are primarily conducted on mainstream datasets, lacking diversity in evaluation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Theorem 4.1 and provide a more robust theoretical foundation for their claims regarding the expressiveness of 1-dimensional features. Additionally, we suggest improving the clarity of proof 4.1 by providing a more structured proof sketch and explicitly addressing the role of self-loops in distinguishing graphs. It is essential to acknowledge prior works that have explored similar concepts in topology preservation. We also recommend clarifying the use of node features in Proposition 1, ensuring that the distinction between node features and labels is clearly articulated. Furthermore, we suggest expanding the experimental evaluation to include a wider variety of datasets beyond the mainstream ones currently used. Finally, enhancing the writing style and addressing typographical errors will improve the overall presentation of the paper.
