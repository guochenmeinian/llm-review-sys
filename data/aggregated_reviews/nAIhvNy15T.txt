Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into classifier-free guidance in image-generating diffusion models, revealing that its effectiveness varies with noise levels. The authors propose a method that applies guidance only at intermediate noise levels, which enhances sample quality, diversity, and reduces sampling costs. The findings are supported by quantitative results from EDM2 and DiT models trained on ImageNet, and qualitative results from the pre-trained Stable Diffusion XL.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The toy examples in Figures 1 and 2 are intuitive and clarify the behavior of guidance across different noise levels, showcasing originality.
- The method is straightforward to implement and can be easily integrated into various diffusion models, enhancing its significance.
- The ablation studies in Figures 3 and 4 effectively demonstrate the proposed method's efficacy, while qualitative results in Figures 5 through 8 illustrate guidance behavior in Stable Diffusion XL.
- The paper is well-written and accessible, with thorough experiments analyzing the impact of guidance over an interval.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a discussion of existing works addressing high-guidance scales, such as dynamic-CFG, and does not sufficiently differentiate its contribution from prior research.
- Questions remain regarding the variability of the optimal guidance interval with model performance and the potential detrimental effects of guidance at high noise levels for more complex conditions.
- The limitations are not clearly presented in section 4, and the authors should address them more explicitly.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section to include discussions on existing methods addressing high-guidance scales. Additionally, we suggest clarifying whether the optimal guidance interval varies with different sampling algorithms and providing a discussion on reducing the cost of hyperparameter search. Finally, we encourage the authors to present limitations more clearly in both section 4 and the conclusion.
