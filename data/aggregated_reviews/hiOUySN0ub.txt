Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel pre-training framework named MMM for scalp EEG data, addressing the challenges of varying electrode configurations across datasets. The authors propose a unified topology that maps different channel selections, utilizing multi-dimensional position encoding and a multi-level channel hierarchy. The framework aims to enhance representation learning from EEG data, validated through experiments on emotional detection tasks, demonstrating significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles a critical issue of sensor configuration heterogeneity, offering a meaningful contribution to EEG research.
- The proposed method is intuitive and well-structured, achieving adequate performance improvements.
- The presentation is clear and cohesive, with well-designed figures that enhance understanding.
- Comprehensive experimental validation, including ablation studies, supports the robustness of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- Clarity issues arise from minor typos and unclear descriptions, particularly regarding the masking methods used in experiments.
- The related work section lacks completeness and accuracy, missing relevant studies and discussions on electrode types.
- The experimental details, such as train/validation/test splits and dataset manipulations, require more thorough explanation.
- The results show small improvements that may be influenced by random noise, and the number of random seeds used is not reported.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the manuscript by addressing minor typos and enhancing the readability of figures, particularly by optimizing text sizes. Additionally, please clarify the masking methods used in the reconstruction experiments and provide a comparison of performance metrics between different masking strategies. It would also be beneficial to expand the related work section to include more relevant studies and discuss the impact of electrode types on transferability. Finally, we suggest including more comprehensive details on the experimental setup, including the random seed count and dataset manipulation methods.
