### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the lifelong temporal knowledge graph (TKG) reasoning problem, proposing a model that utilizes a temporal-path-based reinforcement learning (RL) framework. The authors focus on the temporal displacement between timestamps of candidate edges and preceding edges, incorporating this into the RL action space. They introduce a new edge-aware message passing module for transferring learned relation types to emerging entities and construct three new datasets based on benchmark datasets to simulate lifelong TKG reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in temporal link prediction.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is the first to explore lifelong TKG reasoning, simulating growing TKGs with unseen timestamps and new entities.  
- The proposed method shows superior performance compared to other baselines and is well-written and easy to follow.  
- The introduction of three new TKG benchmarks fosters future research in this area.  

Weaknesses:  
- The evaluation is limited to ICEWS datasets, lacking tests on larger-scale datasets like GDELT.  
- More experiments are needed, particularly on new entities and standard TKG settings, to substantiate the proposed method's superiority.  
- The introduction of Temporal-Rule-Based Reward Shaping lacks clarity and requires further elaboration.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction to Temporal-Rule-Based Reward Shaping in Section 3.5, particularly by expanding on Eq. 9. Additionally, the authors should clarify the distinction between temporal displacement and relative time as proposed in TITer. To strengthen the evaluation, we suggest conducting experiments on larger datasets such as GDELT and including other baselines like RE-NET and RE-GCN. Furthermore, detailed analysis on inductive reasoning should be provided to support the claims regarding the model's performance on new entities.
