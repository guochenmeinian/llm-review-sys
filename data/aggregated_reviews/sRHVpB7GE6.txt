### Key Points
This paper presents SCALE, a Natural Language Inference (NLI) based model for detecting factual inconsistencies in long documents. The authors propose a novel chunking strategy to efficiently handle lengthy texts and introduce ScreenEval, a new dataset for evaluating factual inconsistencies in long dialogues. SCALE demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods, particularly on the ScreenEval dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for detecting factual inconsistencies in long documents is clear and promising.
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- SCALE outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks and the new ScreenEval dataset.
- The introduction of ScreenEval provides a valuable resource for future research.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed method lacks innovation, primarily differing from previous methods by breaking documents into larger chunks rather than sentences.
- Implementation details, such as the chunking technique, are insufficiently described.
- The paper omits calibration scores in the method section, leading to potential confusion.
- Figures are blurry and could be improved.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the description of the chunking technique to enhance clarity. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explicitly state the reasons for better calibration scores in the method section. It would also be beneficial to publicly release the code and dataset to facilitate reproducibility. Finally, we encourage the authors to consider automatically determining the chunk size to avoid including irrelevant information.
