### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the biases in machine translation systems regarding names associated with different gender and racial/ethnic groups. The authors develop a dataset of demographically aligned names and employ round-trip machine translation to analyze translation quality. They find that names associated with female, Black, and Hispanic identities are mistranslated more frequently, highlighting a significant social bias in language models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The study provides a new dataset (DNIC) for testing demographic biases in machine translation, derived from a well-designed New York City baby names dataset.  
- The mixed-effects model methodology offers a robust statistical framework for quantifying biases across translation systems.  
- The paper deepens the understanding of biases in machine translation, contributing to an important area of research.

Weaknesses:  
- The selection of 16 template sentences may not adequately represent the diversity of real-world contexts involving names.  
- Strong causal interpretations regarding the reasons for mistranslations and their implications for identity may not be sufficiently justified by the evidence presented.  
- The paper oversells results in the abstract, as some outcome measures show no significant differences in translation accuracy for certain demographic groups.  
- Issues with error measurement and the non-uniqueness of round-trip mapping are not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the representation of sentence templates to better reflect real-world contexts involving names. Additionally, the authors should justify the strong causal interpretations made regarding mistranslations and their implications. Clarifying the statistical assumptions of logistic regression and discussing the construction of standard errors would enhance the methodological rigor. We also suggest focusing on non-exact match errors to better assess name translation quality. Finally, addressing the questions regarding name variant errors and the determination of race categories in the dataset would strengthen the paper's clarity and depth.
