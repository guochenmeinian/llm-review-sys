Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel few-shot anomaly detection method that employs an anomaly personalization technique using a diffusion model and a triplet contrastive inference process. The authors propose transforming query images into personalized images aligned with the normal distribution, which enhances the triplet contrastive inference. Extensive experiments across eleven datasets in industrial, medical, and semantic domains demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces innovative approaches utilizing the diffusion model for distribution modeling and anomaly image recovery, which are effective and well-motivated.
2. The triplet contrastive strategy offers a robust multi-level method for anomaly map extraction from various perspectives.
3. Comprehensive experiments validate the method's superior performance across multiple datasets.

Weaknesses:
1. The potential for increased inference time due to the diffusion model raises concerns about real-time applicability.
2. Insufficient details on experimental settings, particularly regarding hyperparameters like alpha and beta, limit reproducibility and raise questions about the claims of state-of-the-art performance.
3. The lack of theoretical analysis and clarity in certain definitions, such as S_text, diminishes the paper's rigor.
4. The absence of discussion regarding the computational cost and inference speed, along with missing equation numbers, complicates understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental settings by providing detailed information on hyperparameter selection and the memory bank's characteristics. Additionally, a theoretical analysis should be included to support the empirical findings. The authors should also clarify the definition of S_text and ensure that all equations are numbered for easier reference. Furthermore, a discussion on the computational cost and inference speed is necessary to address concerns about real-world applicability. Lastly, including an ablation study to explore the impact of varying the number of generated normal samples would enhance the robustness of the findings.
