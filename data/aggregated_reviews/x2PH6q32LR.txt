Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method to leverage local effects in graph-based spatio-temporal forecasting by incorporating trainable node embeddings into spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs). The authors argue that existing STGNNs are global models that may overlook node-specific patterns. They propose a framework that balances local and global modeling through random node embeddings and regularizations to enhance transferability. Empirical results demonstrate consistent improvements across various models and datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The problem addressed is intriguing, challenging the conventional use of shared global STGNNs for all nodes.
2. The technique of trainable node embeddings is straightforward and well-founded, with sensible regularization terms.
3. The effectiveness of the proposed technique across multiple models (DCRNN, AGCRN, GWNet) and datasets indicates its general applicability.
4. Experimental results support the notion that node embeddings and regularizations facilitate knowledge transfer, countering the expectation that node-specific parameters would underperform on unseen nodes.

Weaknesses:
1. The method of using node-specific embeddings is not novel, as it mirrors the approach in STID [40], raising concerns about the technical contribution's adequacy for NeurIPS.
2. The fine-grained categorization of spatio-temporal graph neural networks (e.g., T&S, TTS, anisotropic vs. isotropic) appears unnecessary and could be omitted for clarity.
3. The paper's organization is poor, complicating the understanding of its main arguments.
4. Important TTS methods are not discussed in the related work, which limits the context of the proposed framework.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization of the paper to enhance clarity and comprehension of the main arguments. Additionally, we suggest removing unnecessary categorizations of spatio-temporal graph neural networks that do not contribute to the paper's understanding. To strengthen the novelty claim, the authors should clearly differentiate their approach from STID [40] and address the implications of using static node embeddings versus dynamic local models. Finally, including a discussion of missing baselines and providing a running time comparison during testing would enrich the paper's contributions.
