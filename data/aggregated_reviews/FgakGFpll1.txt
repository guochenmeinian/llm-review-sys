Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a metadata-driven approach to analyze the sensitivity of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to graph data properties, specifically through a multivariate regression analysis on 15 datasets. The authors identify significant properties such as Gini-Degree, Edge Homogeneity, and In-feature similarity, revealing a negative correlation between Gini-Degree and GNN performance. The study includes theoretical analysis and controlled experiments, particularly focusing on the influence of degree distribution on GNN performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper offers a novel approach to an important problem, emphasizing the empirical performance of GNNs on benchmark datasets.  
- It is well-written and organized, with clear results supported by theoretical analysis and experiments.  
- The concept of metadata-driven analysis holds potential for further research refinement.

Weaknesses:  
- The characterization of "universal factors" is misleading, as they apply only to the GNN models considered.  
- The selection of GNN models lacks justification, and the metadata-driven analysis is incomplete, primarily focusing on correlation rather than causality.  
- The theoretical model's applicability to other universal features and the verification of Lasso's assumptions require further exploration.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for their selection of GNN models to ensure they are representative and diverse. Additionally, expanding the analysis to include real-world datasets with varying Gini-Degree would enhance the generalizability of their findings. The authors should also address the completeness of the metadata-driven analysis by exploring causality beyond Gini-Degree and connecting their findings to existing literature on node degrees. Lastly, clarifying the theoretical model's implications for other universal features would strengthen the paper's contributions.
