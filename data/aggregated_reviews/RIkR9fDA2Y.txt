### Key Points
This paper presents novel datasets, ML-DDD and AO3, integrated with sensitivity labels to evaluate the impact of recommendation systems on user exposure to sensitive content. The authors examine how different recommendation algorithms, such as TopPop and SVD, influence the visibility of content with sensitivity labels. The findings indicate that personalized algorithms do not necessarily amplify sensitive content, which has significant implications for developing more nuanced AI systems that respect user preferences and sensitivities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The originality of introducing ML-DDD and AO3 datasets for studying sensitive content in recommendation systems.  
- The study addresses an important gap by augmenting existing datasets with content warnings, providing a foundation for understanding the amplification or mitigation of sensitive content exposure.

Weaknesses:  
- The interpretation of results indicating that personalized algorithms do not amplify sensitive content needs clarification.  
- There is a lack of inclusion of diverse and recent recommendation algorithms, such as neural network-based and graph-based models, which could enhance the study's quality.  
- The paper requires a more comprehensive discussion on potential biases in sensitive content labels, particularly regarding cultural and regional differences that may affect the generalizability of the datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the interpretation of their findings regarding personalized algorithms and their impact on sensitive content. Additionally, consider incorporating a wider range of recommendation algorithms, including neural network-based and graph-based models, to explore different amplification behaviors. Finally, we suggest a more thorough discussion on the biases in sensitive content labels, addressing cultural and regional differences to enhance the datasets' generalizability.
