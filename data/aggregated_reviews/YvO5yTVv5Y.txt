Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to vision-based online HD mapping, introducing two main contributions: (1) AP_{raster}, a new metric designed to better evaluate methods in this domain, and (2) MapVR, a plug-in rasterization and loss module applicable to existing vector-based online mapping systems. The authors validate MapVR extensively across three datasets, demonstrating its ability to maintain or improve existing metrics while significantly enhancing the proposed AP_{raster} metric. The work addresses limitations in current mapping algorithms and metrics, providing a unified framework that integrates rasterization into vectorization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Both contributions are well-motivated and straightforward.
- Extensive empirical evaluation across four task settings and three datasets, with careful ablation of MapVR's design choices.
- Clear presentation and organization of the paper, making it easy to understand the goals and motivations.
- Convincing analysis and visual evidence supporting the need for the rasterization-based metric.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation could be slightly improved, with some text repetition noted.
- AP_{raster} may be sensitive to hyper-parameter choices, which could be addressed in a supplementary experiment.
- The significance of the contribution may be questioned, as the results, while sound, do not clearly establish the necessity for future models to focus on the AP_{raster} metric.
- The experiments primarily utilize MapTR, limiting the exploration of architecture-agnostic applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation by rephrasing repetitive sections, particularly L30-32 and L96-106, to focus on the differences between vector-based techniques rather than the motivation for MapVR. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include a discussion on the computational overhead of MapVR during training. We suggest conducting a thorough failure case analysis to identify limitations and implications of rasterization resolution, particularly regarding the best performance at 256x128. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide examples of various map elements in the appendix to showcase the effectiveness of their method.
