### Key Points
This paper presents a pseudo-labeling approach for the Referential Expression Comprehension (ReC) task, utilizing scene graphs to generate training examples in an unsupervised manner. The approach comprises three components: generating and decorating a core scene, filtering ambiguous queries, and rewriting queries for enhanced diversity. The main contributions include a scene graph-based pseudo-labeling framework, techniques like the disambiguation module and rewriting component, and quantitative results demonstrating improved model performance over previous unsupervised methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The scene graph-based pseudo-labeling approach is novel and outperforms prior methods on standard datasets.  
- The design choices are well-motivated and detailed, with benefits validated through ablation studies.  
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with impressive performance on benchmarks for unsupervised ReC.  

Weaknesses:  
- The generalizability of performance improvements across different datasets is unclear, particularly for those lacking spatial relations.  
- The reliance on specific models, such as VLTVG, limits the demonstration of the method's effectiveness across various architectures.  
- The heuristic aspects of the Non-Ambiguous Query Generation procedure require further clarification regarding their impact.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the heuristic components in the Non-Ambiguous Query Generation procedure and provide metrics for the ablation study on the use of spatial information on the RefCOCO dataset. Additionally, conducting experiments with a preliminary scene graph, rather than solely relying on the core scene graph, would enhance understanding of the generated scene graphs' quality. A qualitative analysis of the rewriting strategy using GPT-3.5 should also be included to validate its effectiveness. Finally, addressing the adaptability of the template-based filtering step to diverse distributions would strengthen the paper's claims.
