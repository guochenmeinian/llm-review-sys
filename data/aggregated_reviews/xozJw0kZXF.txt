### Key Points
This paper presents a systematic study on the object hallucination problem in large vision-language models (LVLMs). The authors evaluate existing metrics, particularly CHAIR, highlighting its instability and complexity. They propose a new evaluation framework, Polling-based Object Probing Evaluation (POPE), which addresses these issues by framing object hallucination as a binary classification task. The results demonstrate that POPE offers better stability and scalability across various datasets, emphasizing the need to consider both object hallucination and task-based evaluation performance in real-world applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well written and structured, making it easy to follow.
- The proposed POPE metric effectively resolves the instability and complexity issues of CHAIR.
- The empirical study is comprehensive, evaluating multiple representative LVLMs.

Weaknesses:
- The qualitative and quantitative analyses are limited, particularly in showing only the top-10 objects in MSCOCO, which may not sufficiently support the hypotheses.
- The reliance on yes/no responses to measure object hallucination raises concerns about the depth of understanding regarding object presence.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the qualitative and quantitative analyses by showing the cumulative hallucinated count over all objects in MSCOCO to support their hypotheses more robustly. Additionally, evaluating models with more diverse prompts and answer candidates, such as synonyms for "yes" and "no," could enhance evaluation accuracy. Furthermore, addressing the broader implications of object hallucination beyond yes/no responses and considering comparisons with other VL tasks, such as image captioning or image classification, would strengthen the paper's conclusions.
