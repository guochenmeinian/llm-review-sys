### Key Points
This paper presents a self-supervised representation learning approach tailored for strong gravitational lens images, introducing the LenSiam architecture based on SimSiam with a lens-specific augmentation technique. The authors evaluate the LenSiam method through UMAP embeddings of learned features and a downstream regression task, addressing challenges posed by existing augmentation techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and engaging, indicating significant effort in its preparation. 
- The proposed ideas are well-motivated and necessary background information is effectively introduced.
- The experiments are well-executed, yielding convincing results.

Weaknesses:
- The citation style is somewhat unconventional, which may be typical in other research areas.
- The description of SimSiam as "more computationally affordable than other contrastive learning methods" should be revised, as SimSiam is not a contrastive method.
- The claim that UMAPs are not shown in Figure 2 due to limited space is misleading, given the submission length allows for additional figures.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the SimSiam description by correcting its classification as a non-contrastive method. Additionally, we suggest including more extensive experiments with numerical comparisons to strengthen claims about existing baseline augmentation techniques and demonstrating that methods like SimCLR or BGRL yield significantly poorer results. Since there is available space, we encourage the authors to add additional UMAP visualizations and other relevant content. Finally, considering research directions such as applying AFGRL could provide valuable insights into addressing the challenges identified in the study.
