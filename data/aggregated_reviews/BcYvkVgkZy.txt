### Key Points
This paper presents a critical examination of the benchmark task of template filling for document-level information extraction, highlighting the arbitrary nature of event individuation decisions. The authors demonstrate that standard evaluation metrics penalize different individuation choices, which undermines model comparability. Through an annotation study, they reveal low agreement among experts on event individuation, suggesting that existing datasets may contain questionable judgments. The authors analyze state-of-the-art models, showing that they fail to learn individuation rules and propose recasting template filling as a question-answering task to avoid reliance on explicit individuation decisions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a compelling critique of an important benchmark task, raising awareness of a significant issue in information extraction.
- It is well-written and structured, articulating its position clearly and supported by rigorous empirical evidence from multiple angles.
- The proposed alternative question-answering formulation represents a novel direction that could better handle individuation challenges.

Weaknesses:
- The alternative QA formulation is only briefly outlined, lacking sufficient detail to demonstrate its feasibility as a comprehensive solution.
- Key content is relegated to a lengthy appendix, making core ideas harder to grasp in the main text and suggesting that the contribution could be better communicated in a longer format.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and detail of the alternative question-answering formulation to demonstrate its feasibility as a full solution. Additionally, we suggest that the authors consider integrating more critical content from the appendix into the main body of the paper to enhance the communication of their core ideas and innovations.
