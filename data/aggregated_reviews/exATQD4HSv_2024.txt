Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel SSM-based DSR algorithm, convolution SSM model (convSSM), designed to recover underlying systems, particularly in contexts where current observations depend on the entire history of previous states, such as fMRI signals. The model is trained using SGD with generalized teacher forcing (GTF) to mitigate exploding gradients. The authors validate their approach through simulations (Lorenz63 and ALN) and apply it to the experimental fMRI dataset (LEMON), demonstrating its scalability for dynamic system reconstruction, which is beneficial for inference and prediction tasks. Additionally, the paper provides a detailed analysis of hyperparameter selection and model performance in chaotic systems, specifically using the LEMON and Lorenz63 datasets. The authors propose that while the performance evaluation (PE) does not capture long-term statistics, assessing $D_{stsp}$ on short sequences can still indicate long-term performance effectively. They acknowledge the flexibility of piecewise linear models and the impact of the number of pieces on performance, emphasizing their choice of higher dimensions to ensure robust comparisons. Furthermore, the authors commit to including comparisons with SLDS models and further discussions on hyperparameter selection in the revised manuscript.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The convSSM method, trained via SGD+GTF, efficiently scales with model size and convolution length.  
2. The model selection strategy based on short empirical time series is practically useful.  
3. The models reliably extract key features of dynamical systems.  
4. The paper provides a thorough examination of hyperparameter selection and model efficacy in chaotic systems.  
5. The authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the limitations of current performance evaluations and propose practical solutions.  
6. The inclusion of discussions on extensions and hyperparameter tuning is a valuable addition.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The primary contribution lies in training convSSM with GTF for signal convolution, leveraging the linearity of Wiener deconvolution, which may limit its generalizability.  
2. The modeling of the observation equation as a function of the entire latent history complicates inference, potentially missing correlation structures captured by simpler models like Gaussian processes.  
3. The application to the LEMON dataset lacks a comparative analysis with standard SSM techniques, leaving questions about the novel algorithm's real-world efficacy.  
4. The analysis of SLDS models is incomplete due to time constraints, which may limit the robustness of the comparisons.  
5. There is a potential overstatement of results from the mutual information analysis, given the authors' unfamiliarity with the testing package.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for incorporating correlation modeling into the observation equation, as this complicates inference. It would be beneficial to demonstrate the necessity of this approach compared to simpler models, such as Gaussian processes. Additionally, including a comparative analysis with standard SSM techniques on the LEMON dataset would clarify the advantages of the proposed method. The authors should also finalize their comparisons with SLDS models to strengthen their findings and explore the conditional independence test further, as it may provide insights into hyperparameter tuning strategies. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors improve the clarity of their hyperparameter selection process by rephrasing their responses to RC2 and Q2 and including this information in the supplementary materials. Lastly, addressing the unclear aspects in figures, particularly in Figure 2, and ensuring that the introduction discusses relevant models comprehensively would enhance the overall quality of the manuscript.
