### Key Points
This paper presents adNPM, a method for measuring mobile network performance by embedding measurement scripts in advertisements. The approach allows for large-scale data collection without user participation and has been validated through both controlled lab tests and real-world applications across 15 countries. adNPM demonstrates accuracy comparable to traditional tools while significantly reducing data usage.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- adNPM aligns closely with established tools while consuming less data.
- It effectively utilizes existing ad infrastructure, facilitating large-scale deployment.
- The paper includes extensive real-world analyses, showcasing adNPM's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution of the paper is unclear, particularly regarding the adNPM approach versus the landscape analysis.
- Concerns about privacy and ethics arise from the data collection methods, particularly regarding user consent and data handling.
- The reliance on ad campaigns may limit real-world applicability due to regional restrictions and ad-blocking practices.
- The measurement introduces latency, which could hinder its practicality as a tool.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding the contributions of the paper, specifically distinguishing between the adNPM approach and the landscape analysis. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on how required information is collected while ensuring user privacy and compliance with regulations like GDPR. It is crucial to clarify whether users were informed and consented to the data collection process. 

We also suggest including an illustrative diagram of the adNPM workflow to enhance understanding of the methodology. Furthermore, the authors should address potential biases in the data collection process, such as the impact of personalized ads and the effects of ad-blocking technologies. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide a more detailed discussion on the limitations of the dataset, including the absence of connection technology and signal strength data, and how these factors might affect the results and conclusions drawn from the study.
