Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on multiclass classification within adversarial settings, focusing on optimal mistake bounds rather than regret. The authors aim to establish tight relationships between optimal mistake bounds for deterministic and randomized algorithms against both oblivious and adaptive adversaries in full and bandit feedback models. A significant contribution is an upper bound linking the optimal mistake bounds for randomized algorithms in the bandit model to those in the full feedback model. The results include nearly optimal bounds and address open questions in the field.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work provides new results characterizing the price of bandit information in optimal mistake bounds for multiclass classification, contributing original and nontrivial technical insights.
- The paper effectively addresses several important questions in online learning, filling gaps in existing literature and establishing strong connections to prior work.
- The theoretical contributions are well explained, particularly the key ideas in Theorem 1.1 and 1.5, and the results lead to interesting open questions.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution is more technical than conceptual, with many proof techniques being extensions of previous work.
- The readability of the paper is a concern, as key concepts are often deferred to appendices, making it challenging for non-expert readers.
- Some gaps remain in the provided bounds, particularly in Theorem 1.2, and the proposed algorithm for prediction with expert advice is deemed inefficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the accessibility of the paper by integrating fundamental concepts into the introductory sections rather than deferring them to the appendices. Additionally, elaborating on the relationship between mistake bounds and regret bounds for bandit multiclass classification would enhance clarity. It would also be beneficial to discuss the practical implications of the findings more thoroughly. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors provide absolute upper and lower bounds on the various $\mathrm{opt}(\mathcal{H})$ whenever available, and clarify the extent to which existing proof techniques for bounding regret can be reused for proving mistake bounds.
