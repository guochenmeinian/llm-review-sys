### Key Points
This paper presents Hierarchical Catalogue Generation for Literature Review, introducing a dataset and two evaluation metrics: Catalogue Edit Distance Similarity and Catalogue Quality Estimate. The authors aim to address the lack of a clear hierarchy in literature reviews by benchmarking models for generating hierarchical catalogs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The research problem is well motivated and the proposed task is interesting.
2. The dataset constructed could facilitate future research in this area.
3. The authors provide innovative evaluation methods and a thorough analysis of the problem.

Weaknesses:
1. The work is more suitable for the resource and evaluation track, lacking new methodological contributions.
2. The reliability of the proposed metrics is insufficiently verified, with a limited dataset size of 450 samples.
3. The choice of baselines is outdated, with all references prior to 2021.
4. The dataset is biased towards survey papers in computer science, and the method is considered simple without significant improvements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the reliability of the proposed metrics by expanding the dataset size and ensuring a more diverse representation beyond survey papers. Additionally, we suggest conducting a thorough analysis of common organizational styles in literature reviews to inform the generation of survey catalogs. Clarifying the main findings from the experiments and summarizing the reasons for model performance differences would enhance the results analysis. Finally, we encourage the authors to consider constructing a high-quality human-annotated dataset and releasing it for broader validation.
