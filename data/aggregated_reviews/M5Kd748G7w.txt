### Key Points
This paper presents a novel combination of Bayesian model averaging and Bayesian convolutional neural networks to model battery health over time. The authors leverage the uncertainty estimates provided by Bayesian neural networks and employ a robust model averaging approach. The application section effectively demonstrates the algorithm's performance on a publicly available dataset, although it lacks specific citations for replicability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well written and interesting, effectively demonstrating Bayesian decision-making using AI.  
- The approach successfully applies probabilistic model fusion for battery state-of-health predictions, which is a non-trivial contribution.

Weaknesses:  
- The citation for the dataset is too general; it should reference the specific dataset used for better replicability.  
- Model comparisons and evaluations lack external benchmarks, making it difficult to assess the performance relative to existing methods.  
- The novelty of the approach is limited, and the differences from Alcibar et al. (2024) are unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the citation for the dataset to a more specific reference to enhance replicability. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons to external benchmarks to better contextualize the performance of the proposed method. It would also be beneficial to emphasize and discuss the differences and similarities between the proposed method and existing approaches. Lastly, please add an abstract before the introduction.
