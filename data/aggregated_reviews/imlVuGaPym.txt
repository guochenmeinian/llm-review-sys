### Key Points
This paper presents an Equivariant Quantum Neural Network (QNN) for image classification, extending QNN by incorporating geometrical symmetries in input data. The authors provide a brief description of the architecture and some experimental results on small datasets (NMIST and fashion). However, the paper lacks clarity regarding its contributions and does not adequately position itself within the existing literature.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Quantum technologies are recognized as a promising field.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution of the paper is vague and lacks clarity.
- Related works are incomplete and not discussed.
- Presentation quality is poor, with figures not referenced or commented on.
- There is insufficient evidence for a scaling advantage over classical approaches, and existing literature suggests otherwise.
- The choice of observable operators may lead to training difficulties due to barren plateaus.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions and explicitly state the total number of qubits used in their approach. It is crucial to engage with existing literature to position the paper against state-of-the-art methods and address skepticism regarding quantum advantages. We suggest presenting performance metrics in terms of classification accuracy rather than loss for better comparability with classical networks. Additionally, the authors should consider demonstrating either a scaling advantage or a computational advantage in terms of energy consumption or compute time.
