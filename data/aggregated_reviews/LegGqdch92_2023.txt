Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the FLAIR dataset, a high-resolution (20 cm) multimodal land cover semantic segmentation dataset encompassing 19 classes across 817 km² of France. It integrates very high-resolution (VHR) aerial imagery, elevation data, and Sentinel-2 time series, aiming to enhance land cover classification. The authors clarify the data collection and preprocessing methods, including radiometric and geometric corrections, and the use of two camera systems for aerial acquisitions. The accuracy of the produced labels is ensured through a rigorous validation process involving independent verification of randomly selected polygons. The authors propose a new baseline model that leverages both aerial images and temporal dynamics from the satellite data, addressing challenges related to spectral confusion among vegetation categories. They also acknowledge the need for a more informed benchmark design to validate their dataset, emphasizing the importance of including various semantic segmentation networks and discussing architectural design details.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The FLAIR dataset is large, well-organized, and features high-quality land cover labels generated by geography experts.
- Comprehensive explanation of data collection and preprocessing methods enhances dataset reliability.
- The dataset effectively addresses the challenges of heterogeneous spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions in land cover semantic segmentation.
- The authors have addressed previous suggestions and made improvements, such as adding performance metrics for the satellite-only baseline and modifying the methodology.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for utilizing multi-source optical imagery is not clearly articulated, and the issues with existing datasets are inadequately described.
- The chosen patch size for Sentinel-2 images appears arbitrary, and the multimodality of the dataset is inaccurately defined.
- The benchmark design lacks comprehensive validation through multiple methods beyond U-Net and U-TAE.
- Limited visual examples in the main text may hinder understanding for readers unfamiliar with satellite data.
- Metadata encoding choices, particularly for acquisition years and location information, may not be optimal for enhancing classification accuracy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for using multi-source optical imagery in the introduction by explicitly discussing the limitations of existing datasets and emphasizing the advantages of Sentinel-2 images. Additionally, it is essential to visualize the time series change curves for each category in Figure 3 to enhance understanding of spatio-temporal distributions. The authors should justify the choice of 40×40 size for Sentinel-2 patches, as a smaller size may suffice. The term "multi-modal" should be revised to "multi-sensor" to accurately reflect the dataset's characteristics.

Furthermore, we suggest addressing the spatial domain offsets caused by the close proximity of training, validation, and test sets during data partitioning. Including training, validation, and test data distribution displays in Figure 4 would help measure domain biases. The authors should elaborate on the reasons for metadata encoding methods and consider using a transformer instead of MLP in the "Collapsed" module. Setting loss weights for the semantic masks based on high-resolution images is also recommended.

Lastly, we encourage the authors to improve the benchmark design by incorporating a wider range of semantic segmentation networks for high-resolution imagery and satellite imagery time series, such as those referenced from OpenEarthMap and PASITS. Discussing architectural design details, including loss weight and multi-sensor feature fusion modules, would also promote broader adoption of the dataset. For metadata encoding, consider evaluating the effectiveness of different types of metadata and their impact on classification results, particularly regarding the use of one-hot encoding versus Fourier encoding for acquisition years.
