Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on hypothesis selection in a streaming setting, focusing on the trade-off between memory usage and sample complexity. The authors propose a novel algorithm, the "random ladder tournament," which achieves a near-optimal memory-sample trade-off for selecting hypotheses from a set of distributions. The main result indicates that a certain number of samples is sufficient to output a suitable estimator with constant error probability, contingent on specific memory constraints.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a classic question in nonparametric statistics and introduces novel techniques that could influence future research.
- The algorithm is technically sound and nearly resolves the hypothesis selection problem, achieving tight bounds up to logarithmic factors.
- The presentation is generally clear, with a clean summary at the beginning.

Weaknesses:
- The paper's significance to the broader machine learning community is questioned, as the model may seem contrived and lacks practical implications.
- The presentation could be improved; the technical details are challenging to grasp without thorough engagement with the appendix, and the motivation for the model could be better articulated.
- Some comparisons with existing literature, such as Neyman-Pearson tests and orienteering tournaments, are lacking.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for their model, particularly the restriction to Scheff√© sets, and provide a more cohesive explanation of how the algorithm operates. Additionally, we suggest that the authors eliminate preliminary discussions in the introduction that detract from the main argument and focus on a clearer exposition of the "random ladder tournament" technique. A more detailed discussion of the memory-sample trade-off proof would also enhance the paper's clarity. Finally, addressing the minor comments regarding terminology and clarifications in the methodology would strengthen the overall presentation.
