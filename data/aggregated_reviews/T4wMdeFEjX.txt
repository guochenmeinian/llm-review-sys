### Key Points
This paper presents AutoTools, a unified framework that enhances LLMs' ability to utilize tools by encapsulating various tools into callable functions and employing them in downstream tasks to address real-world problems. The authors propose a method that automates tool learning, significantly reducing manual effort in processing documentation and creating demonstrations. The empirical validation is robust, featuring existing benchmarks and a new dataset (AutoTools-Eval) to assess the approach's effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is simple and effective, demonstrating clear technical contributions with automatic tool encapsulation and programming-based integration.
- The empirical validation is strong, with comprehensive experiments and efficiency gains in token consumption compared to baseline models.
- The approach enhances the capabilities of open-source LLMs, focusing on targeted learning tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The relevance of the work to the WWW conference is unclear, and the connection to the semantics track needs to be more explicitly stated.
- The writing lacks clarity in several sections, making it difficult to understand the methodology and results.
- There is limited discussion on failure modes, computational costs, and the novelty of the methodology, which appears more engineering-oriented than innovative.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing throughout the paper, particularly in the methodology and results sections, to enhance understanding. Additionally, please clarify the relevance of this work to the WWW conference and the semantics track. We suggest providing a more comprehensive discussion on the limitations and failure modes of the approach, as well as the computational costs associated with training AutoTools-Learning. Furthermore, please explicitly discuss the innovative aspects of the methodology and how it distinguishes itself from existing techniques, particularly in relation to models like ToolLLM. Lastly, consider addressing the questions regarding test case diversity, tool screening, and the management of API versioning and documentation updates.
