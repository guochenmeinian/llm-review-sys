### Key Points
This paper presents an adaptive textual label noise learning framework that integrates an adaptive warm-up stage and a hybrid training stage, utilizing pre-trained models to address label noise. The authors introduce a dynamic early stopping method for the warm-up process, assessing the model's fit to various noise scenarios. The hybrid training stage employs generalization strategies to correct mislabeled instances, effectively leveraging noisy data. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method performs comparably or better than state-of-the-art methods across diverse noise scenarios, including mixed types of noise.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a significant problem in NLP and Machine Learning, focusing on label noise, which is prevalent in real-world applications.  
- The adaptive warm-up stage with a dynamic early stopping method is a clever approach that mitigates overfitting to noise during early training.  
- The hybrid training stage effectively incorporates generalization strategies for correcting mislabeled instances.  
- Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method across various noise scenarios.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks a detailed discussion on the computational cost of the approach, particularly given the pre-training phase.  
- The practical applicability of the method to extreme or highly structured noise scenarios remains unclear.  
- There is insufficient analysis explaining why the proposed method outperforms others, which could enhance understanding of its effectiveness.  
- The dependency of the method's performance on the quality of pre-trained models is not adequately addressed.  
- The experimental setup primarily involves synthetic noise, raising questions about real-world applicability and the complexity of the pipeline.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the computational cost associated with their approach, particularly regarding the pre-training phase. Additionally, clarifying the method's applicability to various types of noise, especially extreme cases, would strengthen the paper. We suggest providing deeper insights into the model's behavior to elucidate why the proposed method performs better than existing methods. Furthermore, addressing the dependency on pre-trained model quality and considering the implications of using synthetic noise in experiments would enhance the paper's robustness and relevance to real-world scenarios.
