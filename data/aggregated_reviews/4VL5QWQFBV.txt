Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel implicit watermarking scheme that utilizes disentangled style domains to detect unauthorized dataset usage in text-to-image models. The authors propose a method that enhances copyright protection through implicit z-watermarks, achieving structured delineation of copyright boundaries and effective verification for hybrid or partial infringements. The method demonstrates high robustness against various attacks and includes One-Sample Verification for dataset copyright verification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem addressed is significant, focusing on dataset copyright protection in generative AI.
- The approach of disentangling image content and style is innovative and potentially effective.
- The paper includes extensive experiments demonstrating the method's state-of-the-art performance and robustness.

Weaknesses:
- The writing is convoluted, making it difficult to follow the method's modules and their interconnections.
- Mathematical descriptions are overly complex, lacking clarity on symbols and their meanings.
- The paper does not provide sufficient examples of the experimental data used.
- There is a lack of experiments on copyright ownership verification for hybrid or partial infringements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing, particularly in the method section, by providing clearer explanations of the modules and their connections. Additionally, simplifying the mathematical descriptions and ensuring that all symbols are well-defined would enhance reader comprehension. Including practical examples of the data used in experiments and expanding the copyright verification experiments to include hybrid or partial infringements would strengthen the paper. Furthermore, we suggest comparing the proposed method with other state-of-the-art watermarking techniques to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
