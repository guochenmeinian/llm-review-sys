Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents advancements in physical adversarial attacks on pedestrian detection, emphasizing the impact of distance on attack performance. The authors propose a distant image converter (DIC) to bridge the appearance gap between digital and physical environments and introduce multi-frequency optimization (MFO) to address feature inconsistencies across distances. The effectiveness of these methods is evaluated through experiments conducted at distances ranging from 4 to 40 meters, demonstrating improved attack success rates.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The authors focus on the critical factor of distance affecting physical adversarial attack performance, which is a significant exploration.  
2. Comprehensive evaluations and ablation studies of the DIC and MFO modules enhance the method's credibility.  
3. The DIC accounts for atmospheric conditions, camera effects, and effect filters, showcasing a thorough modeling approach.  
4. Extensive real-world experiments validate the proposed method, supported by quantitative evaluations.

Weaknesses:  
1. Videos in the supplementary materials indicate that the attack performance may not align with claims, as adversarial patches are detected in many frames.  
2. The paper lacks comparisons with other established methods, such as AdvPatch, Adv-Tshirt, NAP, and T-SEA.  
3. The physics-based DIC involves non-differentiable operations, raising questions about the authors' approach to gradient propagation during training.  
4. The relationship between the proposed method and YOLOv2 is unclear, as YOLOv2 is not mentioned in the paper despite apparent connections.  
5. Certain terms and abbreviations are not adequately defined upon first use, leading to unclear descriptions.  
6. Important references are missing, which could enhance the paper's context.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the attack performance claims by ensuring that the supplementary videos accurately reflect the results discussed in the paper. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with other popular methods like AdvPatch and TC-EGA to contextualize the proposed approach. The authors should clarify how they handle gradient propagation in the DIC, particularly given its non-differentiable nature. Furthermore, we advise explicitly addressing the connection to YOLOv2 in the manuscript. To enhance readability, please ensure that all abbreviations are defined upon first use and consider adding the missing references to strengthen the paper's foundation.
