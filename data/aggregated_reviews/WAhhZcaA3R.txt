### Key Points
This paper presents an approach for lay summarization of biomedical articles by incorporating information from knowledge graphs (KGs). The authors propose three methods for integrating KG information into a base encoder-decoder architecture: (A) concatenating a graph encoding of the document and external knowledge in the decoder, (B) concatenating the graph and document encodings and interpolating between this and an additional layer, and (C) linearizing the graph representation and passing it into the transformer. The evaluation is conducted on the eLife dataset, comparing the proposed methods against strong baselines, demonstrating improved performance through both automatic and human evaluations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, organized, and detailed.
- The methods for injecting KG information are intuitive and explore different integration stages.
- The evaluation includes comparisons against well-known baselines and employs robust metrics (ROUGE, BARTScore) along with human assessments.

Weaknesses:
- The conclusions may not generalize to other base models beyond LongFormer.
- The evaluation relies solely on one dataset, limiting the breadth of findings.
- The manual evaluation is conducted on only five articles, raising concerns about the robustness of the performance measures.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by testing their methods on additional datasets. Additionally, the authors should clarify whether the code will be made available to enhance reproducibility. To strengthen the evaluation, we suggest increasing the number of articles in the manual evaluation to provide a more comprehensive assessment of performance. Finally, addressing the potential impact of external knowledge on the abstractiveness of summaries would be a valuable addition to the discussion.
