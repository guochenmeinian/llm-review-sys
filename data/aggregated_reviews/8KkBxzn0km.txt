Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Saliency-driven Experience Replay (SER), a novel method for online continual learning that leverages visual saliency to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. The authors propose a dual-branch architecture consisting of a saliency prediction network and a classification network, which are trained collaboratively. The saliency-driven modulation is implemented through element-wise multiplication of outputs from both branches. Experimental results indicate that SER achieves state-of-the-art performance when integrated with existing methods and demonstrates robustness against spurious features and adversarial attacks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The manuscript is well-organized and clearly written, making the proposed method easy to understand.
2. The SER method is simple yet effective across various online continual learning settings.
3. The paper is scientifically motivated and includes extensive experimental validation, demonstrating significant improvements in classification performance.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the approach is incremental, as prior work has already introduced saliency into class incremental learning.
2. The claim that SER is model-agnostic is misleading; the saliency encoder must maintain a homogeneous structure with the classification network, limiting its compatibility with certain methods.
3. The experiments are solely conducted on ResNet-18, raising questions about the generalizability of the method to other architectures.
4. Some sections require more detailed explanations, particularly regarding the robustness against adversarial attacks and the implications of certain figures and tables.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty discussion by clearly delineating how SER differs from prior works that utilize saliency in continual learning. Additionally, the authors should provide evidence of SER's effectiveness with architectures other than ResNet-18, including experiments on Transformer models. We suggest expanding the method description to include more detailed explanations of the saliency modulation process and its implications. Finally, we encourage the authors to include more recent methods in their comparisons to enhance the relevance of their findings.
