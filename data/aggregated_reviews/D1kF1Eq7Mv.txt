### Key Points
This paper presents a system combination method for grammatical error correction (GEC) that selects the optimal combination of edits from multiple GEC systems. The method computes quality scores based on word substitution, deletion, and insertion gap scores, utilizing a pretrained encoder that learns F_{0.5} scores. The proposed system employs voting scores alongside outputs from individual GEC systems. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves superior F_{0.5} scores compared to existing quality estimation (QE) systems and sets new state-of-the-art results on the BEA-2019 and CoNLL-2014 test sets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is model-agnostic, enhancing scalability and usability.
- Achieves the highest F_{0.5} scores on established test sets, demonstrating robust experimental validation.
- Introduces innovative techniques such as multicomponent loss for training and beam-like inference.

Weaknesses:
- Certain details lack clarity, such as the reasoning in the introduction and the aesthetics of Figure 2.
- The term "gap labels" requires earlier clarification to avoid confusion.
- The absence of a human evaluation experiment on system combination results diminishes the overall convincingness of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity in the introduction by elucidating the reasoning relationship. Enhancing Figure 2 for better aesthetics would also be beneficial. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the term "gap labels" early in the method section. Conducting a human evaluation experiment on the system combination results would strengthen the paper's claims. Reporting the time taken for system combination would provide valuable insights into the efficiency of the proposed method compared to previous work. Furthermore, addressing the questions raised regarding the applicability of simultaneous edits and the sizes of intermediate layers would enhance the paper's rigor.
