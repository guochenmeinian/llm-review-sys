### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to word-level auto-completion (WLAC) by integrating machine translation (MT) capabilities. The authors propose a criterion where better predictions are likely to align with high-quality translations and introduce a method for jointly training WLAC and MT models. The results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the WMT22 WLAC test set, with a notable reduction in parameter size. The paper includes a thorough analysis of experimental results and discusses the limitations of existing models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is well-motivated and effectively addresses WLAC tasks using MT models.
- Experimental results are robust, showing significant improvements over SOTA models.
- The analysis of errors and insights into model performance are well-articulated.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation quality could be improved for clarity, particularly for readers unfamiliar with WLAC.
- Code release is necessary for better reproducibility.
- Some technical details, such as evaluation metrics for the MT model, are lacking.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation to make it more accessible to readers not well-versed in WLAC. Specifically, consider revising Section 3 to clarify that it serves as a preliminary analysis rather than proposing a new metric. Additionally, we suggest including evaluation metrics like BLEU for the MT model in Table 3 to enhance understanding of its performance. Furthermore, addressing the minor presentation issues noted by reviewers, such as reordering tables and improving figure clarity, will strengthen the overall quality of the paper. Lastly, providing more details on the synthetic dataset generation process will aid in reproducibility.
