### Key Points
This paper presents a new dataset for investigating the spray/load verb alternations in English, aimed at enhancing understanding of language models' (LLMs) grasp of argument structure. The authors utilize the Blackbird Language Matrices framework to create a benchmark dataset that probes how sentence embeddings from pretrained models like RoBERTa and ELECTRA capture complex predicate-argument structures. The dataset construction involves heuristic methods and includes a qualitative analysis of model errors, revealing challenges in understanding lexical semantics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, clearly articulating the motivation and methodology for constructing the dataset.
- It provides comprehensive empirical results that may inform future model development.
- The application of a new diagnostic task to a nuanced linguistic phenomenon is a valuable contribution, enhancing the analysis of LLMs.

Weaknesses:
- Some experimental details and dataset construction methods are insufficiently described, leading to potential reproducibility issues.
- Lack of baseline comparisons, including human performance, raises questions about the interpretability of the results.
- The paper would benefit from further proofreading, as certain sections are difficult to understand.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the dataset construction process, particularly regarding how embeddings from RoBERTa and ELECTRA are obtained and how sentences are extracted in SPIKE. Additionally, including examples for each subpattern in Section 2.3 and clarifying Figures 2, 3, 9, and 10 would enhance understanding. We also suggest that the authors address the maintenance and extensibility of the dataset for future benchmarks and consider including baseline comparisons, such as random chance performance and human performance, to strengthen the paper's contributions. Lastly, we advise proofreading the manuscript to rectify any unclear sections and typos.
