Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DiffusionFake, a novel approach to enhance face forgery detection by reversing the generative process of deepfakes. The authors propose a plug-and-play framework that integrates with existing detectors, utilizing a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model to reconstruct source and target images. The method aims to improve cross-domain generalization without adding inference parameters, demonstrating significant performance improvements across various architectures.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a unique perspective by designing a method from the deepfake creation viewpoint, effectively addressing information loss during reconstruction.
- The plug-and-play functionality enhances the generalization ability of multiple detection networks without additional parameters, facilitating deployment.
- The presentation is clear and well-structured, with important visualizations and figures that aid understanding.

Weaknesses:
- The training set may include instances where the source and target ground truth are identical, necessitating clarification on how this trade-off is managed.
- The discussion on the weight module lacks clarity and detail.
- Visualization figures show discrepancies between reconstructed source images and ground truth, requiring an explanation from the authors.
- More ablation studies are needed, particularly regarding the evaluation of the feature-transform module's structure.
- The weighting module's assumption of linearity in latent representation is questionable, and there is no analysis of the loss weight's influence in Eq. 13.
- The evaluation is limited to low-resolution images, and cross-model evaluation has not been conducted.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the discussion surrounding the weight module and provide a detailed analysis of the influence of the loss weight in Eq. 13. Additionally, the authors should address the discrepancies observed in the visualization figures and conduct more ablation studies to evaluate the feature-transform module's structure. It would be beneficial to include cross-model evaluations and assess performance with high-resolution images. Finally, we suggest that the authors cite and discuss recent relevant literature to strengthen the context of their work.
