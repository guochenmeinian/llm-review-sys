Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new latent variable model for neural recordings, named 'ODIN', which employs a flow-based readout to map from latent space to neural activity. The authors argue that the injectivity of flow-based methods enhances the model's performance, demonstrating ODIN's superiority over baseline models, including linear and MLP readouts, on both synthetic and biological datasets. The extensive evaluations cover various aspects of model performance, including neural activity reconstruction and latent dynamics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses the critical need for improved neural data analysis tools, leveraging machine learning concepts to enhance performance across datasets.
- The thorough characterization of models, including diverse evaluations of reconstruction, latent trajectories, and activation functions, is commendable.
- The focus on readout injectivity is novel and the paper is well-written, with clear figures aiding comprehension.

Weaknesses:
- The necessity of injectivity as a key issue in existing methods remains unconvincing, as linear models can be injective under certain conditions.
- The performance differences between ODIN and MLP-NODE lack clarity regarding the role of injectivity, as MLPs can also learn injective functions.
- The complexity of the ODIN model may hinder interpretability compared to simpler linear methods, despite capturing neural data with fewer latent dimensions.
- The theoretical foundation of the work is weak, with a need for more rigorous evaluation of when the technique is effective and its long-term implications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical backing of their work by addressing when the proposed technique will be sufficient and under what conditions it holds. Additionally, it would be beneficial to conduct a broader evaluation of model performance across various parameter settings for AutoLFADS and GPFA to better contextualize ODIN's performance. We suggest including statistical tests to substantiate claims of significant performance improvements over MLP-NODE and to explore the impact of hyperparameter choices on results. Lastly, a more detailed discussion on weight regularization as a means to encourage simpler dynamics could enhance the manuscript's robustness.
