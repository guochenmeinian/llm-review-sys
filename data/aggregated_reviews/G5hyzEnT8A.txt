### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of Starlink's performance, utilizing data from over 34 countries, marking it as the largest measurement study to date. The authors compare Starlink's performance against terrestrial cellular networks and analyze its capabilities for real-time applications like Zoom and Amazon Luna. The study also delves into the latency introduced by the bent-pipe mechanism and examines Starlink's reconfiguration intervals.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a thorough analysis of Starlink's performance across a wide geographical area.
- It provides significant insights into the internal workings of Starlink, beyond mere application-layer evaluations.
- The writing is clear, well-structured, and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on the appendix for understanding some discussions and results can hinder clarity.
- General claims made in the paper often lack sufficient statistical rigor.
- The analysis may not accurately reflect realistic deployment conditions, raising questions about the validity of broad generalizations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by reducing reliance on the appendix and focusing on the first two key takeaways for more in-depth analysis. Additionally, exploring statistical techniques for a more rigorous comparison of existing data will help solidify the claims made. We also suggest emphasizing the discussion of the bent-pipe mechanism and reconfiguration intervals to highlight the novelty of the work. Lastly, when evaluating cloud gaming, consider a more realistic approach to user actions rather than executing them at pre-defined intervals.
