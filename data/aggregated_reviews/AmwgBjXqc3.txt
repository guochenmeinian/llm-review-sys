Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for understanding contextually-informed algorithmic fairness criteria selection, specifically focusing on counterfactual fairness. The authors propose that counterfactually fair predictors can achieve accuracy-optimal outcomes in the target distribution while aligning with specific correlational fairness criteria. The work contextualizes these findings within various causal graphs, addressing two primary questions: the conditions under which counterfactually fair predictors minimize risk and how classic statistical fairness metrics correspond to counterfactual fairness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
* The work is well-written and clear, providing a novel perspective on the relationship between counterfactual fairness and statistical fairness metrics.
* The theoretical results are of high quality, bridging gaps between different fairness concepts and offering practical insights for researchers and practitioners.

Weaknesses:
* The lack of empirical validation through simulated or real-world data significantly limits the generalizability of the claims, particularly the focus on a purely spurious setting.
* The organization of the paper could be improved, with some sections needing better placement for clarity and coherence.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including simulated experiments to validate the claims regarding counterfactually fair predictors and their relationships with observational fairness criteria. Additionally, we suggest expanding the discussion on the limitations of the purely spurious setting and how the findings apply to real-world scenarios. Clarifying the assumptions for each theoretical statement and improving the organization of the paper will enhance readability. Finally, we encourage the authors to incorporate illustrative figures for complex concepts and ensure consistent terminology throughout the text.
