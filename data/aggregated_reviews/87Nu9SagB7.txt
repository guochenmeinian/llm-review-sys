Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analytical framework to quantify the effects of numerical errors on sampling, density evaluation, and ELBO estimation in variational flows, leveraging shadowing theory to derive error bounds based on shadowing window sizes and local Lipschitz constants. The authors propose a diagnostic procedure to validate results from numerically unstable flows, demonstrating that despite numerical instability, results can remain accurate. However, the practical applicability of the framework is questioned, as it relies on the shadowing property being established.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an important and under-studied aspect of numerical analysis in flow-based models, providing a plausible explanation for the resilience of results against numerical errors.
- The derivations of numerical bounds are intuitively sound, and the material is presented clearly and logically.
- The use of shadowing theory offers a rigorous framework, and the proposed diagnostic procedure could be valuable for practitioners.

Weaknesses:
- The framework's practical usefulness is uncertain, as results depend on the shadowing property being established, and the approach in Section 5 appears cumbersome and may not scale well.
- Numerical experiments do not convincingly support claims, showing only qualitative traits without demonstrating the tightness of derived bounds.
- Presentation issues exist, including unclear notations and insufficient empirical validation of the proposed diagnostic procedure.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of notations and enhance the presentation of the paper. Additionally, we suggest providing more extensive empirical validation of the diagnostic procedure across various datasets and flow types to strengthen the generalizability of the findings. It would also be beneficial to discuss the computational feasibility of the shadowing window size estimation algorithm and clarify the assumptions underlying the theoretical results, particularly regarding the shadowing property.
