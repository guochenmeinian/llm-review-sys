### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of the engagement-diversity tradeoffs in social media, specifically focusing on how content injection policies can enhance diversity at the potential cost of user engagement. The authors formulate a linear program to optimize content injection and theoretically bound the tradeoff between engagement and diversity. They investigate the implications of their model using Twitter data, exploring how different types of tweets affect user engagement and diversity metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper provides a comprehensive and self-contained analysis of the engagement-diversity tradeoff, with a plausible theoretical model and clear empirical results.
2. The authors objectively present their findings and acknowledge the limitations of their model, which enhances the credibility of their work.
3. The modeling choices are well-justified, and the analysis includes extensions to more general cases, broadening the model's applicability.

Weaknesses:
1. The metrics for measuring engagement and diversity are limited, relying solely on retweets, which may not capture the full spectrum of user interactions such as comments and likes.
2. The model is overly stylized, assuming specific initial conditions that may not hold in real-world scenarios, raising questions about its generalizability.
3. The empirical experiments lack diversity in datasets, as they focus on networks with similar structural features, limiting the robustness of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the measurement of engagement by incorporating other interaction types, such as comments and likes, to provide a more comprehensive view of user engagement. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the implications of their propagation model on the injection policy and explore how results might differ if propagation is not modeled. It would also be beneficial to conduct experiments on networks with varying structural features to enhance the robustness of the findings. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide more detail on the types of tweets used in their datasets and discuss how varying the number of content types might impact the results.
