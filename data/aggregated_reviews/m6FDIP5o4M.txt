### Key Points
This paper evaluates the robustness of the speech-driven gesture generation model "DiffuseStyleGesture+" concerning input pitch range and noise environments. The authors propose objective measures using FGD and MSE metrics; however, a subjective evaluation is notably absent. The paper suggests that higher pitch voices correlate with larger and faster gestures, while lower pitch voices result in smaller and slower gestures. The authors also explore the implications of voice conversion technologies for data augmentation but question the association of gestures with converted voices. Additionally, the robustness to environmental noise is discussed, with a recommendation to quantify noise levels in terms of SNR.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Addresses a significant and relevant problem in the field.
- Proposes a novel and simple data augmentation method for co-speech gesture generation.
- Includes a well-structured experimental setup and results analysis.

Weaknesses:
- Lacks sufficient references and supporting evidence in some sections.
- Needs more clarity and structure in explanations.
- Should evaluate a broader range of models to generalize findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by adding more references, particularly in the last sentence of the first paragraph, to strengthen the foundation of the study. Discussing similar datasets and their advantages and disadvantages would clarify the significance of the proposed dataset. The authors should explore how gestures vary in different environments and consider the impact of gender and emotion on body gestures.

In the related work section, addressing existing gesture datasets from various environments could highlight gaps that the current work aims to fill. The authors should provide more supporting references in the second paragraph of the methodology and clarify the term "untrained condition," including how it impacts results.

We suggest that the authors evaluate additional models, such as transformers or GAN-based architectures, to generalize findings better. The explanation of the frequency matching algorithm should include clearer notation, and the authors should provide supporting evidence for claims regarding expressive data and prosodic variations. 

Lastly, we recommend including a section on user studies or human evaluations to complement quantitative metrics, as user feedback could enhance insights into the modelâ€™s practical applicability. With these revisions, the paper could significantly contribute to the field of speech-driven gesture generation.
