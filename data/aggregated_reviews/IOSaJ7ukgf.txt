Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for modeling protein surfaces and dynamics using signed distance fields (SDF) through implicit neural representations. The authors propose a method that takes 3D coordinates and time as inputs to generate SDFs, optimized by minimizing the distance of 3D points on the surface, matching normals, and applying Eikonal term regularization. The experiments demonstrate the model's capability to reconstruct dynamic protein surfaces, although performance declines with rapid movements. The method shows potential for interpolating between states and predicting future dynamics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The work is well-written, with a clear introduction that contextualizes previous research and motivates the addressed task. The datasets are well-described, enhancing reproducibility.
2. Additional visualizations in the supplementary materials aid in understanding the modeling of dynamics with implicit neural representations, showing that reconstructions diverge from ground truth as RMSD increases.
3. The method is evaluated across various contexts, including its ability to interpolate and extrapolate in time, and a case study demonstrates the learning of a latent space that encodes dynamics of similar proteins.

Weaknesses:
1. Visualizations indicate that the method may introduce non-existent artifacts near the structure, likely due to implicit surface representation.
2. The claim that reconstructions are clearer than ground truth is questionable; it is unclear if rapid movements are noise or true dynamics, complicating the evaluation of reconstruction validity.
3. The assertion that the method resolves dynamics of large proteins lacks quantitative comparisons with prior work.
4. The rationale for using implicit representations over other methods is not clearly articulated, and experimental validation is insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the nature of rapid movements in the structure, addressing whether they are noise or part of true dynamics. Additionally, in the interpolation experiments, clarify how one frame is extracted from multiple frames and specify the RMSD between the endpoints used for interpolation. To enhance the evaluation, consider including comparisons with simpler baseline methods and provide metrics that reflect the usability of the predicted trajectories, such as the correlation for docking on ground truth surfaces. Finally, a more detailed discussion on the implications of using implicit representations versus other methods would strengthen the paper.
