### Key Points
This paper presents a study on online advertising bidding under unknown impression values, focusing on maximizing revenue while adhering to budget and Return-on-Spend (RoS) constraints. The authors propose a novel Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)-style algorithm that balances exploration and exploitation, providing theoretical bounds for regret and constraint violations. The empirical evaluation is conducted using synthetic data, demonstrating the algorithm's effectiveness compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem addressed is highly relevant to the online advertising industry, with a theoretically sound and practically applicable solution.
- The paper is well-structured, featuring clear definitions and a logical flow of ideas, along with effective use of figures and tables.
- The introduction of related work highlights the originality of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks experimentation on real-world data, which limits its practical relevance and significance.
- The theoretical proofs are overly complex, making them difficult to follow.
- There is insufficient discussion regarding the implementation challenges of the algorithm in real-world advertising platforms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including case studies or experiments with real-world data to strengthen their claims and demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness in actual scenarios. Additionally, a table summarizing parameter notation and a figure illustrating the auction process would enhance clarity. We also suggest providing a more concise outline of the theoretical proofs in the main text to improve readability. Finally, comparing the UCB-style algorithm with other online learning frameworks could highlight its unique strengths and potential limitations.
