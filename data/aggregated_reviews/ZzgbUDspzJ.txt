Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of the fair range clustering problem, where facilities are linked to multiple demographic labels, leading to intersecting groups. The authors propose both lower and upper bounds on the number of cluster centers selected from each label and introduce a $1 + \epsilon$ approximation algorithm for $k$-median and $k$-means clustering objectives in Euclidean spaces. The key contribution lies in leveraging Euclidean metric properties to enhance approximation ratios while maintaining similar running times as general metric spaces, specifically achieving fixed-parameter tractability (FPT) in parameters $k$ and $\ell$. The authors successfully integrate known techniques from the literature, demonstrating soundness in their proofs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work offers significant theoretical contributions, providing new insights into a challenging variant of clustering that has been extensively studied.
- The approximation results improve upon existing methods, achieving better theoretical guarantees.
- The proposed algorithm is theoretically sound and applicable to high-dimensional data.

Weaknesses:
- The techniques employed are not novel, and the results remain purely theoretical without experimental validation.
- The writing is complex, making it difficult for non-experts to grasp the concepts, and lacks intuitive explanations of the algorithm's workings.
- The data reduction mechanism appears to lack novelty, being a direct consequence of previously established lemmas.
- The practical construction methods for key components of the algorithm, such as the link mapping $\phi$, are not discussed.
- The achieved approximation factors may be significantly larger in practical applications than theoretical claims.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their writing, particularly for non-expert readers, by providing intuitive explanations of key concepts, such as the definition of "core set" and the role it plays in data reduction. Additionally, we suggest that the introduction better justifies the necessity of fair range clustering by including related works on conventional fair clustering and highlighting key differences. We also encourage the authors to conduct experimental evaluations to validate their theoretical claims, especially given the lack of numerical analysis in the current version. Furthermore, clarifying the significance of figures and ensuring that all technical terms are well-defined will enhance the overall presentation of the paper.
