### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the accessibility of linguistic information in pretrained multilingual language models (LLMs) through prompting, utilizing the PET methodology with data from German, Icelandic, and Spanish. The authors frame the task as classification, exploring morphological and syntactical features, and report varying accessibility of features across languages. The study discusses limitations and provides a concise examination of the chosen languages.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a timely and relevant issue with a sound methodology and clear discussion of limitations.
- The choice of languages (German, Icelandic, and Spanish) is well-justified and adds value to the findings.
- The results are presented convincingly, contributing to the understanding of linguistic information extraction from LLMs.

Weaknesses:
- Terminology clarity is lacking, particularly regarding "tangible" and "abstract" features, which affects the manuscript's exposition.
- Key details are relegated to the appendices, making it difficult to evaluate the work fully without consulting them.
- The paper could benefit from a more structured presentation, including moving the related work section earlier in the manuscript.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of terminology, particularly defining "tangible" and "abstract" features, and provide citations for these terms if they are not original. Additionally, we suggest consolidating critical information from the appendices into the main body of the paper to enhance comprehension. It would be beneficial to include precision, recall, and F1 metrics alongside accuracy in the results to clarify findings. We also advise revising the structure by relocating the related work section after the introduction and formulating research questions in the introduction to guide the study. Lastly, please ensure that all terminology is consistent throughout the manuscript, particularly regarding code-switching and mixed-language prompts.
