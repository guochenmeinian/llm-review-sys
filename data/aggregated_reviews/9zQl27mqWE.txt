Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of the training dynamics of a two-layer linear network \( A = W_1 W_2 \), demonstrating that for a broad range of network widths \( w \) and initialization scales \( \sigma^2 \), the dynamics can be approximated by a self-consistent equation. This equation captures a mixture of lazy and balanced dynamics, allowing the authors to explore gradient descent behavior in recovering a low-rank matrix from noisy observations. They identify two regimes: a pure lazy regime, where recovery fails, and a mixed/active regime, where the network aligns with the ground-truth before switching to balanced dynamics for successful recovery.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper unifies the lazy and balanced training dynamics of two-layer linear networks, providing a surprisingly simple equation that allows for a more nuanced classification of training behaviors.
- The authors present a novel global convergence result for balanced initialization without requiring alignment at initialization, leveraging the initial lazy regime to achieve an approximately aligned state.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation requires improvement, as some sections, particularly the appendix, appear rushed and contain numerous typos.
- The assumption that the network width is much larger than the ambient dimension raises questions about scenarios where the width exceeds the rank but is smaller than the ambient dimension, potentially placing the network directly in the active regime.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation, particularly in the appendix, to address the identified typos and rushed sections. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explore the implications of network width relative to rank and ambient dimension more thoroughly, providing theoretical or practical insights into this scenario. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the proof of Theorem 1, particularly regarding the definitions and dependencies of \( \delta \) and \( C_1 \). Lastly, we recommend considering a more explicit description of a two-channel model to enhance understanding of the dynamics presented.
