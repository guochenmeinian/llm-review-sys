Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a dataset for analyzing streaming performance over HTTP/3 browsers named H3B, which collects application and network-level logs during YouTube streaming. The dataset includes over 5910 sessions covering 5445 hours of streaming across five geographical locations and four bandwidth patterns. The authors observe that during adverse network conditions, the system defaults to HTTP/2 over TCP, negatively impacting streaming performance. Additionally, the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of video streaming performance under poor and variable network conditions, focusing on YouTube due to its popularity and the lack of HTTP/3 support in other platforms. The authors propose a QoE metric based on average bitrate, bitrate variation, and rebuffering time, while acknowledging the limitations of PSNR and SSIM metrics in capturing user engagement. The dataset aims to facilitate better configurations of application/transport protocols and enhance predictions of Quality of Experience (QoE).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and addresses an important topic regarding streaming performance under HTTP/3.
- The dataset provides comprehensive coverage of various network conditions, browsers, and geographical locations.
- The unexpected fallback to TCP during HTTP/3 streaming sessions raises significant questions about QUIC's performance.
- The dataset is specifically tailored to analyze video streaming in poor network conditions, filling a crucial gap in existing research.
- The authors have collected diverse data from multiple geographical locations and various devices, enhancing the dataset's applicability.
- The paper outlines a clear QoE metric that integrates key performance indicators relevant to video streaming.
- The authors have committed to enhancing the dataset by including raw application logs and relevant metrics.

Weaknesses:
- The focus on YouTube limits the applicability of findings; exploring other sensitive applications could broaden the research impact.
- The QoE metrics used are limited, lacking critical details like stall duration and frequency.
- The dataset does not include diverse video qualities or a mobile client analysis, which could enhance its relevance.
- The dataset currently provides limited metrics, focusing primarily on average bitrate and rebuffering time, which may restrict its utility for broader QoE analyses.
- The authors do not fully explore the implications of protocol switching and its impact on QoE across different browsers.
- The dataset currently lacks comprehensive metrics that could be beneficial for other researchers.
- The authors' initial formulation of QoE may not fully capture the complexities of video content and user engagement.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including additional use cases for HTTP/3 beyond media streaming, such as file transfers and IoT applications, to provide a more comprehensive perspective on the protocol's versatility. Additionally, exploring other performance metrics like rebuffering time and packet loss rate would enrich the comparison between HTTP/2 and HTTP/3. A more in-depth analysis of the conditions leading to protocol switching and its direct impact on QoE is also suggested. We recommend that the authors improve the dataset by including additional raw measurement data, such as the number of bitrate switches, intervals between switches, and durations of stalls. This would allow users to derive various QoE metrics beyond the current formulation. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors clarify the information extracted in the network.csv file to enhance precision and usability. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore the implications of protocol switching in more depth, particularly how it affects QoE across different browsers, and to clearly document all relevant metrics that can be extracted from the pcap data, ensuring that researchers can utilize this information effectively.
