### Key Points
This paper presents a compact version of Arabic Mini-ClimateGPT, utilizing an open-source LLM fine-tuned for conversational instruction tuning with a dataset named Clima500-Instruct, which includes over 500k instructions on climate change and sustainability. The authors introduce a 500K-scale instruction dataset specifically for the Arabic climate domain and demonstrate that their model outperforms existing models like Alpaca-ar. The study also highlights the creation of a new Arabic climate change QA dataset through machine translation and filtering of existing English datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of the first Arabic instruction dataset for the climate change domain is a significant contribution.
- The dataset development process using ChatGPT-based semi-automatic translation is clear and effective.
- The proposed model reports state-of-the-art results and is reproducible.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on translation for dataset generation raises concerns about accuracy, necessitating further evaluation.
- There is a lack of language-specific insights and motivation for focusing on Arabic, with insufficient discussion on the unique properties of the dataset.
- The contribution of the vector database to QA performance is unclear, and details on the filtering process for the dataset are lacking.
- The limitations section does not adequately address errors and issues found through error analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their dataset creation process by providing more details on the translation and filtering methodology. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on the standards used to determine low-quality instances in the dataset. It would be beneficial to include a discussion on the motivation for focusing on Arabic and to provide linguistic insights beyond token length. Further analysis and ablation studies regarding the impact of the vector database on QA performance are also necessary. Lastly, the authors should enhance the limitations section by including specific references to errors and issues identified through error analysis.
