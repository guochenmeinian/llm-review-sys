Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper benchmarks four common uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for GNNs applied to relaxed energy prediction. The authors explore models, metrics, and tasks, providing extensive experiments that highlight the effectiveness of distribution-free techniques and suggest promising avenues for future research, particularly with latent distance methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-motivated, addressing a critical area of UQ for GNNs in material discovery.
- Extensive experiments benchmark various UQ methods, empirically demonstrating the superiority of distribution-free techniques and establishing strong baselines for future studies.
- The exploration of latent distance methods, particularly with atom-wise distances, shows potential for improved performance.

Weaknesses:
- The focus on EquiformerV2 limits the generalizability of findings; broader studies across different backbones would enhance the robustness of the observations.
- While empirical validation is present, a principled analysis could further strengthen the paper's conclusions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the transparency of their benchmarking by providing detailed information on the ensembles and parameters used, as the current lack of specifics makes it difficult to assess the models being evaluated. Additionally, expanding the study to include various backbones would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the UQ methods' applicability. Lastly, incorporating a principled analysis alongside empirical results would enhance the depth of the findings. Please also address the minor issues noted by the reviewers, such as the missing section number for Table 1 in the Supplement.
