### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach called Unsupervised Sounding Pixel Learning (USPL) aimed at unsupervised sound source localization in videos. The authors propose three main modules: (1) a mask augmentation based multi-instance contrastive learning (MMICL) module for obtaining coarse sounding maps, (2) an Unsupervised Sounding Map Refinement (SMR) module to enhance these maps and recover object boundaries, and (3) a Sounding Pixel Segmentation (SPS) module for producing final pixel-level segmentation results. The experimental results on the AVSBench-S4 and VGGSound datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art unsupervised methods in terms of mIoU and cIoU metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a novel unsupervised method, USPL, for pixel-level sound source localization, addressing challenges in achieving accurate localization.
2. The multi-stage approach effectively aligns audio-visual features, refines coarse maps, and generates fine-sounding maps.
3. Experimental results indicate that USPL surpasses previous methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a deeper theoretical analysis of the underlying principles that support the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
2. The motivation for the SPS module is unclear, particularly regarding its necessity and efficiency compared to the SMR module.
3. The efficiency of the SMR module appears low, and there is insufficient discussion on hyperparameter tuning and computational costs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis of the USPL approach to clarify the principles behind its effectiveness. Additionally, we suggest providing a clearer motivation for the SPS module and discussing its efficiency in relation to the SMR module. It would be beneficial to include a comparison of time and space complexity with and without the SPS during evaluation. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore hyperparameter tuning in more detail and to assess the computational and memory costs associated with their methods.
