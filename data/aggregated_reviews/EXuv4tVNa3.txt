### Key Points
This paper presents DiChaViT, a model for Multi-Channel Imaging (MCI) based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone, addressing the challenge of learning robust feature representations from datasets with heterogeneous channels. The authors propose three novelties: Channel Diversification Loss (CDL), Token Diversification Loss (TDL), and Diverse Channel Sampling (DCS), which collectively enhance feature diversity and improve generalization across varying channel configurations. DiChaViT demonstrates a 2-5 percentage point improvement in classification accuracy on multi-channel fluorescence microscopy and satellite image data, establishing it as state-of-the-art (SOTA) for this task.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed methods are flexible and generalizable, functioning independently of channel configurations and effective across different data domains.
- The mathematical formulations of CDL, TDL, and DCS are solid, intuitive, and elegant.
- DCS offers a significant improvement over existing channel sampling methods, enabling content-aware channel selection.
- Comprehensive ablation studies and well-structured presentation enhance the clarity and reproducibility of the work.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks consistent experiments demonstrating how the introduced novelties lead to performance improvements, with analyses in Appendix B being superficial.
- Claims regarding robustness and the impact of CDL and TDL are not sufficiently supported by statistical evidence, with concerns about the number of runs and the significance of performance differences.
- Misleading notation and naming conventions create confusion, particularly regarding the use of symbols for channel tokens and patch embeddings.
- The methodology is limited to scenarios where all channels are seen during training, which may not reflect real-world applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the depth of their experimental analysis to better demonstrate the impact of CDL and TDL on channel and patch token distributions. Conducting more rigorous statistical testing would strengthen claims of robustness. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the notation used throughout the paper to avoid confusion, particularly regarding the definitions of channel tokens and patch embeddings. It would also be beneficial to address the limitations of the methodology concerning unseen channels during training and provide a more detailed explanation of the tuning process for hyperparameters in the loss function. Finally, exploring the effectiveness of the proposed methods on hyperspectral images could provide valuable insights into their general applicability.
