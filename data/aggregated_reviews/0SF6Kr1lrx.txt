### Key Points
This paper presents Leap-of-Thought (LoT), a novel token reduction approach aimed at enhancing computational efficiency in transformer models through dynamic token routing. LoT enables the selective processing of tokens within transformer layers, guided by a gradient-informed router, which helps maintain significant tokens for downstream tasks. Comprehensive evaluations on various benchmarks demonstrate that LoT achieves substantial improvements in computational efficiency without compromising task accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The gradient-guided router shows superiority over regularization loss, enhancing decision-making regarding token processing.
- The methodology allows for the retention of all tokens while reducing the number processed in each layer, mitigating the risk of losing crucial information.
- Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of LoT across multiple natural language understanding tasks, indicating its applicability in real-world scenarios.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks sufficient analysis of the impact of various components and hyperparameters of LoT, such as the token merging mechanism and the harmony coefficient Î».
- Evaluation is limited to BERT base, with no assessment on larger or smaller models, which is essential for understanding the method's scalability.
- Comparative data on inference speeds in specific computational environments is missing, limiting insights into practical efficiency.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis and ablation studies on the impact of different components and hyperparameters of LoT. Additionally, evaluating LoT on a broader range of model sizes, including BERT-large and TinyBERT, would provide valuable insights into its scalability. We also suggest including comparative data on inference speeds in specific computational environments to better illustrate the method's practical efficiency.
