Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework called Prototypical Hash Encoding (PHE) for On-the-fly Category Discovery (OCD), which aims to identify both known and unknown categories from streaming data using labeled data of known categories. The authors propose a two-part loss function: one minimizes the distance between encoded hash features and category-representative hash coding, while the other enforces minimal distance separation among hash encodings of different categories. Experimental results indicate significant performance improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed approach achieves considerable performance gains and demonstrates robustness to varying coding lengths.
- The method effectively addresses the sensitivity issue in on-the-fly category discovery.
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with comprehensive experimental analysis.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the technical contribution is limited, as the framework adapts established concepts from prototypical learning and deep hashing methods.
- The motivation for balancing instance discrimination and class discrimination is not sufficiently novel, although it is somewhat justified by the newness of the OCD problem.
- The writing is informal in parts, particularly regarding the placement of related works in the appendix, which may confuse readers about the contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their writing by integrating related works into the main text rather than relegating them to the appendix. Additionally, the authors should provide a deeper analysis of why prototypes effectively address the sensitivity issue and experimentally verify the advantages of hash code-based prototypes compared to feature-level prototypes. Furthermore, we suggest including comparisons with deep hashing methods to substantiate the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Lastly, the authors should explore the impact of hyperparameter choices, such as the value of K in category allocation and the effect of the masking strategy's parameter Î¸ on model performance.
