Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies an online bipartite matching problem with Poisson arrival processes, focusing on maximizing individual fairness, defined as the minimum matching rate across online types. The authors demonstrate that the first-come-first-serve (FCFS) algorithm achieves a $1$-competitive ratio for a single offline type. For multiple offline types, they propose an algorithm with a $(1-1/e)$-competitive ratio, which is tight under various conditions. The paper also introduces group-level fairness metrics and short-run fairness, providing algorithms that achieve competitive ratios converging to $1$ under certain conditions. Additionally, the authors establish negative results regarding the limitations of randomized algorithms in this context.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a well-motivated problem and is well-structured and written.
- It introduces fairness considerations for online agents, a novel perspective compared to prior works focused on offline agents.
- The techniques employed are non-trivial and appear correct, with clear definitions of fairness metrics.

Weaknesses:
- Some results, such as the $1$-competitiveness of the FCFS algorithm, seem immediate, and the bounds for short-run and group-level fairness appear preliminary.
- The proofs, while non-trivial, largely utilize existing techniques, making the overall technical contribution seem incremental.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization and motivation of the paper by discussing the significance of the problem earlier, particularly in relation to fairness. Including references to related works on fair online matching would enhance the context and positioning of this study. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the differences between individual and group fairness, possibly discussing connections to intersectional fairness. Incorporating computational experiments could also provide insights into the practical implications of the proposed algorithms.
