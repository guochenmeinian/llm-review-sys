Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to constraint-based causal discovery that addresses the challenges posed by large conditioning sets in statistical independence testing. The authors propose a framework that restricts the size of conditioning variables, introducing the concept of k-Markov equivalence to characterize causal graphs with limited conditioning sets. A new learning algorithm, k-PC, is developed to learn the Markov equivalence class of the k-closure of the true directed acyclic graph (DAG). The theoretical contributions are clearly articulated, and the algorithm is empirically evaluated against existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a rigorous definition of assumptions and solutions related to restricting the size of conditioning sets.
- The introduction of k-closed graphs is well-formulated and contextualized within existing literature on ancestral graphs.
- The proposed k-PC algorithm is sound and has been empirically evaluated against PC, LOCI, and NOTEARS, with code provided for reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- The performance improvements of the proposed method are primarily observed in small sample sizes, raising questions about its efficacy in larger datasets.
- The empirical evaluation lacks real-world examples, which could strengthen the findings, particularly in contexts with non-linear relationships.
- There is insufficient discussion regarding the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm, particularly in relation to checking k-Markov equivalence.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical evaluation by incorporating real-world datasets to demonstrate the practical advantages of the k-PC algorithm over existing methods. Additionally, a thorough discussion on the computational complexity of the algorithm, including the complexity of checking k-Markov equivalence, would enhance the paper's rigor. Clarifying the intuition behind step 5 in the algorithm and addressing the differences between the naive PC approach and the proposed method would also be beneficial. Finally, we suggest computing the area under the curve for the metrics shown in Figure 3 for easier comparison.
