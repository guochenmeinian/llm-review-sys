Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel artificial neural network architecture called Feedback-Feedforward Alignment (FFA), which addresses the weight transport problem by allowing feedback weights to be learned through an autoencoder approach. The authors propose a feedback alignment mechanism that enhances the system's capabilities to mirror human-like phenomena, resolving the weight transport issue by using distinct feedback weights during the backward pass. They demonstrate the model's capabilities on image datasets, showing its ability to discriminate and reconstruct images while replicating biological visual phenomena such as occlusions and hallucinations. The feedback weights can perform various tasks, including image generation and denoising, based solely on the final latent layer's activations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is generally well written and presents an original solution to the weight transport problem without imposing additional constraints like weight symmetry.
- The proposed model architecture and learning rules are creative and demonstrate versatility in applications such as classification, robustness, denoising, and generation.
- The concept robustly addresses a significant limitation of the feedforward paradigm in visual cortex modeling, which fails to account for phenomena like mental imagery and hallucination. The ability to achieve these through a local learning algorithm variant is impressive.

Weaknesses:
- There is a lack of specificity in the formal model description; clarity would benefit from the inclusion of equations detailing exact computations.
- The authors do not adequately address analytical aspects of their model, such as expected solutions in weight space or necessary conditions for the architecture's effectiveness.
- The functional benefits of FFA remain unclear, particularly when compared to backpropagation, which outperforms FFA on harder tasks.
- The bio-plausibility of FFA is questioned, as the relationship between forward and feedback weights is not clearly articulated.
- The literature review is weak, lacking comparisons with existing computational models and relevant biological data.
- The paper lacks sufficient detail on the learning algorithm necessary for reproducibility, including mathematical explanations and pseudocode.
- There is insufficient justification for why the proposed algorithm should yield learning outcomes, particularly given the steep performance drop on CIFAR10.
- The authors do not compare their approach with other biologically plausible algorithms, such as predictive coding or the Wake-Sleep algorithm, which could provide context for their findings.
- The inpainting results are qualitatively inferior to those in Kadkhodaie & Simoncelli 2021, and the paper does not adequately discuss this discrepancy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the formal model description by including equations that detail the computations involved. Additionally, the authors should address the analytical aspects of their model, quantifying the mutualistic interaction between discrimination and reconstruction objectives and clarifying the necessary conditions for FFA's effectiveness. To enhance the bio-plausibility discussion, we suggest providing a clearer explanation of the relationship between forward and feedback weights. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to broaden their literature review to include relevant works in machine learning and neuroscience, ensuring that comparisons with similar models are made. We also recommend improving the clarity of the learning algorithm by providing detailed mathematical explanations and pseudocode for implementation, as well as including a GitHub link to the model's code for reproducibility. We suggest performing direct comparisons with alternative biologically plausible algorithms, particularly predictive coding and the Wake-Sleep algorithm, to contextualize the findings. Additionally, an empirical comparison with Kadkhodaie & Simoncelli 2021 regarding inpainting results would strengthen the paper. Lastly, we encourage a more thorough discussion of the biological plausibility of BatchNorm and its impact on the results.
