Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for deriving a new loss function for Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) methods, introducing Wasserstein Quantum Monte Carlo (WQMC) that utilizes a gradient flow based on the Wasserstein metric. The authors empirically validate their approach on small fermionic systems, such as a Hydrogen chain, demonstrating faster convergence in terms of epochs compared to existing Quantum Monte Carlo methods based on the Fisher-Rao metric. The optimization objective is interpreted as the Fisher-Rao gradient flow, with the proposed method showing practical advantages and improved convergence to ground state energies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a theoretically sound derivation of a new loss function for Quantum Monte Carlo calculations.
- It presents clear empirical results that improve upon state-of-the-art variational Monte Carlo methods regarding convergence rates.
- The writing is clear and the proposed methods are well articulated, potentially leading to more sophisticated optimization techniques in the future.

Weaknesses:
- The empirical evaluation is limited to a small number of systems, raising questions about the method's applicability to larger, more complex systems.
- There is a lack of clarity regarding the baseline for comparison in the experiments, particularly concerning the PsiFormer architecture.
- The computational cost associated with the third derivatives required by the WQMC loss is not adequately addressed, and the experimental section could benefit from broader testing on more complex molecular systems.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical evaluation by including a wider range of test systems, particularly more complex molecules, to better showcase the advantages of the proposed method. Additionally, clarifying the baseline settings for PsiFormer and providing runtime comparisons for each method in the experiments would enhance the paper's rigor. It would also be beneficial to discuss the computational complexity associated with the Wasserstein gradient and consider the implications of the additional gradient computations on overall performance. Finally, addressing the limitations of the proposed method and its potential societal impacts would strengthen the paper's contribution to the field.
