Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an approximate method for minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding that employs matrix completion to reduce computational costs while maintaining translation quality. The authors justify their approach by demonstrating that the utility matrix in MBR decoding is low rank and utilize the alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm to estimate missing values. Experimental results on the WMT dataset indicate that the proposed method, PMBR, achieves superior scores compared to baseline methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method effectively reduces computational costs for MBR decoding without sacrificing translation quality.
- The framing of the problem as matrix completion is a novel contribution, and the empirical results support the low-rank assumption of the utility matrix.
- The method outperforms other approximation techniques and is validated through human evaluation.

Weaknesses:
- Experiments are limited to two language pairs (EN-DE and EN-RU), raising questions about the method's applicability to other languages, particularly lower-resource ones.
- The paper lacks comparisons with recent efficient MBR decoding algorithms, such as Confidence-based pruning and Linear time MBR, which diminishes claims of state-of-the-art performance.
- The analysis of the utility score matrices after convergence is insufficient, and the impact of filled scores on MBR decoding needs further exploration.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental validation by including additional language pairs and models, such as Tower (Alves et al., 2024), to assess the method's robustness across diverse settings. Additionally, comparisons with linear-time cost approaches like QE-reranking (Fernandes et al., 2022) should be included to establish clearer baselines. We suggest providing a more detailed explanation of the MBR matrix earlier in the paper for clarity and addressing the missing figures and tables referenced in the text. Finally, conducting statistical significance tests on the results in Tables 2 and 3 would strengthen the findings.
