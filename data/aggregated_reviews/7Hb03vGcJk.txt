Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Slot-VLM, a framework that utilizes object-centric and event-centric slot representations to enhance video understanding in vision-language models. The authors propose a dual-branch architecture that extracts these concepts through a three-stage training paradigm, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on three video question-answering datasets. The model aims to generate semantically disentangled video tokens for better alignment with large language models (LLMs).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The decomposition of semantics into object-centric and event-centric slots is an interesting approach that supports human-like reasoning.
- The evaluation results across three datasets show strong performance and improved efficiency, validating the effectiveness of structured representations.
- The comprehensive ablation study and detailed reproduction instructions enhance the paper's robustness.

Weaknesses:
- The claim that temporal slots represent events is questionable, as the model may only capture low-level local motion rather than high-level semantics.
- Visualization results do not convincingly demonstrate effective object grouping, raising doubts about the definitions of object and event slots.
- The evaluation metrics used may not be stable or reliable, and the datasets do not focus on object interactions, limiting the validation of the object-centric design.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the definition of event slots in the paper, as the current description may mislead readers regarding their capabilities. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the visualization results to better reflect object grouping, potentially by incorporating advanced object-centric learning methods. To strengthen the evaluation, consider testing on recent multi-choice QA benchmarks designed for human-object interaction, such as STAR or Egoschema, and provide a more comprehensive comparison with existing models. Finally, including additional ablation studies on hyperparameters related to frame sampling rates and pooling strides would provide deeper insights into the model's performance.
