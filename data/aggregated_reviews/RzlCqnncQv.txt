Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an approach to automatically generate PDDL domain and problem description files using LLMs and environment feedback, employing an iterative refinement method. The authors introduce an Exploration Walk (EW) metric to guide this process, achieving a success rate of 66% across 10 tested PDDL domains. The work aims to eliminate human intervention in PDDL generation, claiming novelty in this automation. In response to previous reviewer comments, the authors clarify their definition of human intervention and elaborate on the complexity of their algorithm, asserting that referenced works do not address the same problem. They emphasize their focus on solving challenging planning problems automatically without human feedback and plan to include complexity details in the paper.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem addressed is significant and relevant, with the proposed approach showing promise in automating PDDL generation.
- The introduction of the EW metric is a novel contribution that could enhance future research.
- The paper is well-structured and presents a clear methodology.
- The authors provide thorough clarifications regarding the novelty of their work and the complexity of their algorithm.
- They demonstrate a commitment to addressing reviewer concerns and improving the paper based on feedback.

Weaknesses:
- Assumption 2 regarding domain knowledge capture may not be realistic, as users often lack clarity on necessary domain constraints.
- The dependency on the environment for refinement limits the applicability of the proposed solution.
- The novelty of the approach is questioned due to existing related works that also automate PDDL generation without human intervention.
- The effectiveness of the EW metric as a feedback mechanism is doubted, as it may not provide sufficient guidance for refinement.
- The authors express frustration over the generality of the reviewer's criticisms, which limits their ability to provide targeted responses.
- Some assumptions in the work are deemed unrealistic, raising questions about the significance of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Assumption 2 and address its implications on the work's applicability. Additionally, the authors should provide more detailed explanations of the feedback mechanism used in the refinement process, as this is crucial for understanding the method. It would be beneficial to clarify the problem setup to distinguish between PDDL translation and generation. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors report the percentage of successful runs in their experiments to better illustrate the reliability of their method. Lastly, a more thorough discussion of the computational complexity and soundness of the approach is necessary to strengthen the paper's contributions, and we recommend enhancing the discussion of computational complexity in the main text to ensure it is easily understood by readers.
