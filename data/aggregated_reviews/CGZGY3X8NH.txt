### Key Points
This paper presents ELSA, a novel benchmark dataset designed to evaluate open-vocabulary detection (OVD) models for recognizing and localizing human activities in urban street images. ELSA includes over 4,000 annotated bounding boxes representing 115 unique combinations of human activities across 900 street view images. The authors propose a new re-ranking score, N-LSE, which demonstrates improved effectiveness over Max-Logit. The paper also introduces a confidence-based dynamic box aggregation (CDBA) algorithm to manage multiple predictions for the same object.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a significant gap in multi-label benchmarks for social interactions, facilitating further research in this area.  
- The introduction of the N-LSE re-ranking score is a notable advancement, showing superiority over Max-Logit on the proposed dataset.  
- The clarity and articulation of the proposal are commendable, with a well-structured presentation of the dataset and methods.

Weaknesses:  
- The evaluation is limited to Grounding DINO, lacking comparisons with other state-of-the-art OVD methods.  
- The choice of a 0.3 threshold for bounding box comparisons raises questions about its appropriateness.  
- Ethical concerns regarding the use of Bing and Google street view images need to be addressed, particularly regarding face recognition and blurring.  
- The paper does not sufficiently compare the proposed dataset with existing datasets focused on social activities.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including additional state-of-the-art OVD methods to provide a more comprehensive benchmark. It would be beneficial to conduct ablation studies on the hyperparameters in CDBA to assess their impact on evaluation results. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the legality and ethical implications of using street view images, ensuring that all potential issues are addressed. Lastly, including a comparison of the proposed dataset with existing datasets on social activities would enhance the evaluation and demonstrate its unique contributions.
