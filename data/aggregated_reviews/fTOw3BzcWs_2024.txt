Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ExID, an offline reinforcement learning algorithm that enhances learning performance in limited data scenarios by integrating domain knowledge through a teacher-student architecture. The teacher network, informed by domain knowledge, regularizes the student critic network, improving generalization. The algorithm employs a regularization term to align the critic's decisions with the teacher's advice for states covered by domain knowledge. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that ExID outperforms traditional offline RL algorithms in various discrete environments and a real-world sales promotion dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Domain Knowledge Utilization: ExID effectively incorporates domain knowledge to guide decision-making in data-limited scenarios.
- Teacher-Student Architecture: The integration of a teacher network enhances the learning process of the student critic network.
- Originality: The method's approach to refining initial domain knowledge is innovative and addresses performance degradation in limited-data settings.

Weaknesses:
- Discrete Action Space Limitation: The algorithm is confined to discrete action spaces, limiting its applicability to continuous action domains.
- Hyperparameter Tuning Challenge: Precise hyperparameter tuning is necessary, complicating deployment in scenarios with limited optimization resources.
- Insufficient Experimental Comparisons: The paper lacks strong experimental comparisons with state-of-the-art offline RL methods, such as SCQ, ReDS, A2PR, and CPED, which could strengthen the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by adding more comparisons with state-of-the-art offline RL methods, including SCQ, ReDS, A2PR, and CPED, to provide a clearer context for ExID's performance. Additionally, we suggest exploring the algorithm's performance in continuous action spaces and conducting experiments in more diverse real-world scenarios to validate its applicability. Finally, clarifying the definitions and addressing the concerns regarding hyperparameter selection in resource-constrained environments would enhance the paper's rigor.
