Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a large-scale traffic accident dataset comprising over 9 million records from eight US states, facilitating the evaluation of graph neural networks (GNNs) for predicting accident occurrences. The authors propose a methodology that incorporates multitask and transfer learning, implemented through a GNN framework. They demonstrate that GNNs, particularly GraphSAGE, achieve superior predictive performance compared to more complex models due to its lower number of parameters and the limited labeling rate of their dataset. The study also explores multi-task learning (MTL) to leverage cross-state similarities, finding that MTL outperforms single-task models. The authors provide a user-friendly package for researchers to utilize the dataset and methods, while also addressing comparisons with existing datasets, emphasizing the reliability and coverage of their data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The unified large-scale dataset enhances the ability for comprehensive evaluations and deeper studies, with extensive coverage over a maximum of 20 years.
- The methodology effectively integrates multitask and transfer learning, improving model performance in scenarios with limited labeled data.
- The experimental design includes diverse model architectures and training paradigms, with detailed experimental results clarifying the performance of GraphSAGE relative to other models.
- The inclusion of additional evaluations with state-of-the-art models strengthens the findings and provides a comparative analysis.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for dataset construction and its scalability is insufficiently explained, raising skepticism about the novelty of the dataset construction approach due to a lack of comparison with existing spatio-temporal benchmarks.
- The rationale behind model choices and the implementation of spatiotemporal models is not thoroughly discussed, leading to a lack of depth in the experimental findings.
- The paper does not adequately address the implications of using annual level regression in real-world scenarios or provide a thorough evaluation of related works.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the dataset's motivation and scalability by providing a detailed comparison with existing datasets. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a clearer rationale for their model choices and elaborate on the implementation of spatiotemporal models in the methodology section. A thorough discussion of state-of-the-art spatio-temporal graph learning frameworks, particularly those enhanced by self-supervised learning, should be included to contextualize their contributions. The authors should also elaborate on the implementation details of multitask and transfer learning techniques, as well as provide a more in-depth analysis of their experimental findings. Finally, we encourage the authors to reconsider the practicality of annual level regression in real-world applications and provide a clearer justification for its use.
