Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Extending Multi-modal Contrastive Representation (Ex-MCR), a method for learning multi-modal contrastive representations without paired modality data. Ex-MCR extends one modality's representation space into another while keeping the base modality frozen, thus preserving alignment in the original spaces. The authors demonstrate that Ex-MCR achieves superior performance in audio-text and image-3D retrieval tasks compared to previous methods, particularly C-MCR.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method effectively addresses limitations of prior work by preserving multi-modal alignment, as evidenced by experiments in audio-text and image-text retrieval tasks.
- Ex-MCR is efficient, requiring no paired data and minimal computational resources for training.
- The differentiation between intra-modal and inter-modal alignment using linear and MLP layers is a compelling design choice supported by experimental validation.

Weaknesses:
- The overall clarity of the paper is lacking, particularly in Figure 1(b) and Section 3.2.1, which are difficult to interpret. More illustrative figures and detailed captions are needed.
- There is insufficient evidence that Ex-MCR improves inter-modal alignment over C-MCR, with only slight performance gains noted in audio-image and 3D-image tasks.
- A sensitivity analysis of hyper-parameters such as \(\lambda\) and \(\tau\) is missing, which is critical for understanding the method's effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by enhancing Figure 1(b) and Section 3.2.1 with more illustrative figures and detailed captions. Additionally, the authors should provide explicit evidence or theoretical analysis to support claims regarding information loss during the projection process and modality alignment forgetting. A sensitivity analysis on hyper-parameters should be included to elucidate their impact on performance. Furthermore, the authors should discuss the differences between their decoupled projector and existing projectors, and include comparisons with relevant related works to provide a more comprehensive view of the field.
