### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of the BayPOD approach for generating reduced-order models (ROM) by integrating active learning techniques. The authors propose two variants for data acquisition within the BayPOD framework, focusing on errors between ROM and full-order models (FOM) and on Bayesian uncertainty. The effectiveness of these methods is evaluated against random sampling in a heat dissipation experiment.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a novel active learning framework that effectively addresses the challenge of acquiring large training datasets from high-fidelity models.
2. The integration of Bayesian uncertainty estimation enhances decision-making in selecting informative data points.
3. Experiments demonstrate the cost-efficiency and efficacy of the BayPOD-AL framework.

Weaknesses:
1. Key concepts, such as the distinction between FOM and ROM, are unclear, requiring further clarification for readers unfamiliar with the cited literature.
2. The evaluation is limited to random sampling, lacking a statistically significant advantage over it, and the interpretation of error bars in the results is ambiguous.
3. The scope of experiments is narrow, focusing on a simple problem, which limits the generalizability of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by providing a brief explanation of the distinction between FOM and ROM in the main text. Additionally, the authors should clearly outline the inputs and outputs of the active learning procedure to enhance readability. To strengthen the paper, consider comparing the proposed framework with other state-of-the-art methods, such as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) or sparse regression-based methods. Furthermore, the authors should address the limitations and potential challenges of the framework, including its scalability and sensitivity to acquisition function choices. Providing more details on the Bayesian POD methodology, including the definition of priors and variational distributions, as well as specifics on the neural network architecture and hyperparameters used, would also be beneficial. Lastly, expanding experiments to include more diverse physical systems would bolster the conclusions drawn from the study.
