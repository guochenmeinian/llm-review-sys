Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SCOREQ, a novel approach for speech quality prediction utilizing a triplet loss function for contrastive regression. The authors propose this method to address the domain generalization issues prevalent in existing no-reference speech quality metrics by incorporating Mean Opinion Score (MOS) labels and enhancing training efficiency. The framework employs dynamic triplet mining and an adaptive margin to improve generalization and robustness across diverse audio conditions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The use of triplet loss effectively mitigates the generalization problem of reference-free speech quality metrics.
- Comprehensive experiments on open datasets demonstrate significant improvements in generalization compared to L2 loss.
- The innovative incorporation of an adaptive margin enhances the model's ability to learn nuanced quality differences.

Weaknesses:
- Lack of an ablation study on the adaptive margin and batch-all strategy, as noted in the paper.
- Readability issues due to technical jargon without sufficient explanation, particularly in the introduction and figures.
- Limited evaluation datasets restrict the generalization claims, with underrepresentation of domains like voice conversion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction by providing more background on technical terms and ensuring consistent notation throughout the paper. Additionally, conducting an ablation study to analyze the contributions of the adaptive margin and batch-all strategy would strengthen the findings. Expanding the evaluation to include a broader range of datasets and exploring the applicability of SCOREQ in other regression contexts would enhance the paper's impact. Finally, discussing the computational complexity and potential for real-time applications would provide valuable insights for practical implementations.
