### Key Points
This paper presents a two-stage hierarchical multimodal pretraining framework, MedHMP, specifically designed for Electronic Health Records (EHR) data. It leverages the hierarchical structure of EHRs by implementing stay-level reconstruction and admission-level intra- and inter-modality modeling. The authors demonstrate superior performance across various downstream tasks, indicating the model's effectiveness in handling diverse medical predictive tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents a comprehensive evaluation across multiple levels of EHR data.
- The hierarchical pretraining strategy is thoughtfully devised and executed, showcasing substantial experimental work.
- The use of compelling metrics and published baselines highlights the model's superiority over existing methods.

Weaknesses:
- The absence of a patient-level pretraining objective may hinder the model's performance on tasks requiring interactions across multiple admissions.
- Some sections, particularly 2.3.2 and 3.2.2, lack clarity, and the notation can be difficult to follow.
- Insufficient justification for pretraining decisions and a lack of comparisons to simple baselines, such as gradient boosting methods, limit the study's comprehensiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity in sections 2.3.2 and 3.2.2, particularly regarding equation 9 and the use of LSTM versus transformer for stay-level feature encoding. Additionally, we suggest conducting ablation studies for admission-level only training to clarify the contributions of stay-level data. Including comparisons to gradient boosting methods would provide a familiar baseline for readers. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to address ethical considerations related to the use of non-open-sourced datasets, ensuring transparency in data handling and consent procedures.
