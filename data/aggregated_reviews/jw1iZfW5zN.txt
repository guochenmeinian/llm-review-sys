### Key Points
This paper presents a novel bidirectional decoding framework for morphological inflection, allowing the model to generate sequences from both left-to-right (L2R) and right-to-left (R2L) directions, thereby expanding the search space. The authors incorporate an efficient dynamic programming algorithm into a transformer-based architecture, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on SIGMORPHON tasks. The model demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy over conventional unidirectional models and shows robustness across various languages and output lengths.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The bidirectional decoding approach is innovative and effectively addresses limitations of unidirectional models.  
- The experimental design is robust, with comprehensive comparisons to relevant works, achieving SOTA results.  
- The paper presents clear results and effective decoding strategies, enhancing understanding and applicability.  
- The authors demonstrate consideration for time complexity by utilizing dynamic programming.

Weaknesses:  
- The application of dynamic programming raises concerns regarding computational feasibility, particularly with the attention mechanism in transformers.  
- There is a lack of comparison with existing bidirectional models that decode interactively from both directions.  
- The absence of ablation studies limits understanding of the contributions of specific model components.  
- The improvement over naive bidirectional baselines is modest, raising questions about the framework's generality beyond morphological inflection tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity on how dynamic programming is implemented within the attention mechanism, as this is crucial for understanding computational efficiency. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with other bidirectional models to contextualize the proposed approach. Conducting ablation studies would help clarify the contributions of the model's components to its performance. Finally, providing decoding speed results would offer a more comprehensive view of the model's efficiency and practicality.
