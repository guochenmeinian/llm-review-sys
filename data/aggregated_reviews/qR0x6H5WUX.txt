### Key Points
This paper presents the DART-Eval benchmark for evaluating DNA language models (DNALMs) on regulatory genomics tasks, encompassing five types of tasks with varying difficulty levels. The authors evaluate several recent DNALMs in zero-shot, probed, and fine-tuned settings against state-of-the-art ab initio models. Key findings indicate that existing DNALMs often fail to outperform simpler models, particularly on complex tasks, while incurring higher computational costs. The benchmark offers insights into the limitations of DNALMs and suggests strategies for enhancing their performance in regulatory genomics applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- **Rigorous methodology:** The DART-Eval benchmark is meticulously designed, addressing key biological confounders and incorporating multiple tasks of varying complexity.
- **Thorough evaluation:** The study evaluates multiple state-of-the-art DNALMs across different settings and compares them against strong baseline models, providing a comprehensive assessment.
- **High-quality datasets:** The use of reputable data sources like ENCODE and HOCOMOCO ensures reliable evaluation.
- **Biological context:** The authors demonstrate a deep understanding of regulatory genomics, reflected in their task design and analysis.

Weaknesses:
- **Lack of in-depth analysis:** The paper lacks a detailed exploration of how different model components contribute to performance.
- **Limited exploration of architectural variations:** There is minimal investigation into how specific architectural choices impact performance on regulatory genomics tasks.
- **Insufficient discussion of recent work:** The paper overlooks recent state-of-the-art DNALMs like VQDNA, Caduceus, and Mistral-DNA.
- **Limited discussion of computational efficiency:** The analysis of computational resource requirements is insufficient, which is crucial for practical applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the depth of analysis regarding how different model components, such as tokenization strategies and pre-training objectives, affect performance. Conducting ablation studies would provide valuable insights into these contributions. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons to recent DNALMs like Caduceus and Mistral-DNA to enhance the comprehensiveness of the evaluation. The authors should also provide clearer documentation for the code to facilitate reproducibility. Furthermore, discussing the trade-offs between model size, performance, and computational requirements in greater detail would be beneficial. Lastly, including a human expert baseline for comparison on certain tasks could provide additional context for the findings.
