Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents xTrimoGene, a scalable transformer-based model designed for learning representations of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. The authors propose an asymmetric encoder-decoder transformer that enhances efficiency and scalability for large-scale dataset pre-training. The model addresses challenges in gene expression analysis by utilizing a dedicated value embedding and a unique auto-discretization approach. The authors clarify that gene embeddings multiplied by normalized expression values can lead to uninformative zero-valued embeddings due to high zero expression rates, emphasizing the importance of retaining low-expressed genes to avoid biased regulatory relationships. The method is validated through quantitative comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches and various downstream tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness. Additionally, the authors discuss architectural design differences between xTrimoGene and scBERT, highlighting the need for a strategy that minimizes disparities between pre-training and fine-tuning phases.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The manuscript is well organized and easy to follow, with clear articulation of the challenges addressed, specifically scalability and resolution.  
- The proposed method is technically sound, featuring a novel auto-discretization strategy and thorough evaluation on multiple downstream tasks.  
- The training process is accelerated by utilizing sparse input, making xTrimoGene a valuable contribution to the single-cell community.  
- The authors provide a clear rationale for the necessity of a dedicated value embedder and the architectural choices made in the model design.  
- The explanation of the processing flow enhances understanding of the model's functionality and its differences from existing frameworks like scBERT.  
- The incorporation of batch correction strategies demonstrates a thoughtful approach to addressing technical biases.  
- The authors conducted extensive ablation experiments that justify specific model choices and enhance transparency.

Weaknesses:  
1. The masking and reconstruction strategy, along with the auto-discretization module, appears to be a simple combination of previous works, which may lower the novelty of the proposed method.  
2. The efficiency could potentially be improved by optimizing the padding operation, as padded zeros seem unhelpful in the encoding process.  
3. The authors should provide more analysis to demonstrate the advantages of xTrimoGene over CellTypist, especially given the marginal improvement observed.  
4. The exposition of the auto-discretization strategy lacks clarity, particularly regarding its necessity and implementation.  
5. There is insufficient discussion on potential limitations, such as data leakage, batch effects, and the model's behavior with rare cell types.  
6. The model does not fully utilize cell meta-information, potentially overlooking valuable biological insights.  
7. High memory consumption during inference limits accessibility for some academic labs, and the handling of [PAD] tokens could be optimized for efficiency.  
8. There is a lack of clarity regarding the merging of TSK populations in the embedding space, which raises questions about the preservation of biological distinctions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the auto-discretization strategy by explaining its necessity and how it functions. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed analysis of xTrimoGene's performance compared to CellTypist, including any unique biological insights it may offer. It would be beneficial to address potential limitations, such as data leakage and batch effects, and to explore the model's behavior with rare cell types. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to optimize the padding operation to enhance efficiency and to clarify the masking strategy used in the experiments. We also recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the limitations of the proposed method, particularly regarding the underutilization of cell meta-information, and consider incorporating diverse annotations to enhance model performance and gene-gene regulation understanding. Lastly, we suggest exploring engineering optimizations to reduce memory consumption and improve computational efficiency, particularly concerning the handling of [PAD] tokens, and providing more detailed examples of the merging behavior in the xTrimoGene embedding space to clarify its implications for biological distinctions.
