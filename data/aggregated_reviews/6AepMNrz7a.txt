Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the role of initial membrane potential (IMP) in spiking neural networks (SNNs) and proposes a learnable IMP mechanism to enhance performance. The authors introduce a last time step (LTS) approach to improve convergence speed and a label smooth temporal efficient training (TET) loss for better training outcomes. Empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in image classification tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The concept of learnable IMP is simple, intuitive, and easily implemented in simulations.
2. The paper is clearly written, facilitating comprehension.
3. Comprehensive experiments on image classification tasks show consistent performance improvements with learnable IMP and additional techniques.

Weaknesses:
1. Concerns exist regarding the feasibility of implementing learnable IMP in neuromorphic chips, as the paper does not address hardware implementation issues. If it is impractical or energy-inefficient, comparisons with ANN models of similar size are warranted.
2. The title lacks specificity; it should reflect the focus on neuron dynamics rather than networks. A more informative title could be "Learnable Initial Membrane Potential Enhances Spiking Neural Networks."
3. The expectation that improved neuron dynamics would enhance performance in time series or sequential tasks is not supported by experiments in those areas, raising questions about the generalizability of the proposed methods.
4. Baseline methods should be briefly explained to clarify the fairness of comparisons and provide deeper insights.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the hardware implementation of learnable IMP, particularly in relation to neuromorphic chips like Intel Loihi. Additionally, we suggest providing a more descriptive title that accurately reflects the paper's focus. To strengthen the paper, we encourage the authors to conduct experiments on time series or NLP datasets to demonstrate the broader applicability of their methods. Finally, we advise including brief explanations of baseline methods to enhance the clarity and fairness of comparisons.
