Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on improving the approximation factor for non-monotone submodular maximization under cardinality and matroid constraints, focusing on combinatorial algorithms rather than continuous methods. The authors propose a combinatorial $0.385 - \varepsilon$ approximation for cardinality constraints and a $0.305 - \varepsilon$ approximation for matroid constraints, both running in $O(nk/\varepsilon)$ time. The paper also includes a deterministic $0.377 - \varepsilon$ approximation for cardinality constraints, though with a running time that is exponential in $1/\varepsilon$. The work is significant as it closes the approximation gap for non-monotone submodular functions, which is a critical problem in the field.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an important problem in the ICML and NeurIPS community, with practical applications and a rich literature background.
- It successfully closes the approximation gap for non-monotone submodular functions, improving upon previous results.
- The development of combinatorial algorithms is crucial, as continuous algorithms are often impractical due to high query costs.

Weaknesses:
- The deterministic algorithms presented are impractical due to their exponential dependence on the approximation parameter $1/\varepsilon$, limiting their relevance to theoretical discussions.
- The overall organization and clarity of the paper are lacking, making it challenging to read and understand the algorithms presented.
- Simulations are weakly explained and do not convincingly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithms over simpler greedy methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and organization of the paper, possibly by moving some sections to the appendix to streamline the main body. Specifically, consider rephrasing the introduction of Algorithm 2 to provide a clearer overview of its components. Additionally, enhance the explanations of the simulations, including presenting objective functions and discussing datasets more thoroughly. Addressing these issues will improve the readability and impact of the paper.
