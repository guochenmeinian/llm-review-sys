### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the "radioactivity" of watermarked text generated by large language models (LLMs), focusing on the detectability of such text when used as training data for fine-tuning other models. The authors propose methods to detect whether outputs from a watermarked LLM have been utilized to train another model, demonstrating that even a small percentage of watermarked content can be reliably detected. The study explores various scenarios based on model access and training data exposure, providing insights into the relationship between watermark robustness and detection effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses an important and timely problem, contributing novel methods for detecting radioactivity in LLMs.  
- The empirical results indicate promising detection capabilities, even with low percentages of watermarked training data.  
- The writing is clear and the structure is logical, facilitating reader comprehension.  

Weaknesses:  
- The algorithms in the central contribution section are inadequately described, particularly regarding the null hypothesis and p-value computation.  
- The methods are primarily focused on specific watermarking techniques, raising concerns about generalizability to other watermarking schemes.  
- There are several presentation issues, including formatting inconsistencies and unclear definitions, which detract from the overall rigor of the paper.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the algorithm descriptions, explicitly defining the null hypothesis and detailing how p-values are computed. Additionally, the authors should address the generalizability of their methods to other watermarking schemes beyond the fixed-window, hash-based approaches. We suggest enhancing the presentation by correcting formatting errors and ensuring consistent terminology throughout the paper. Furthermore, a more thorough discussion of the implications of watermark removal on radioactivity detection should be included to reflect realistic scenarios.
