Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework that combines neural coding concepts of information transmission and probability density modeling, based on an even code principle where the output response density aims to be even given an arbitrary input density. The authors demonstrate that this coding principle yields sensible bases for low-dimensional inputs and orientation-tuned filters for natural image patches. However, it remains unclear whether the study offers unique insights into sensory coding in neural populations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study is clearly presented, with concepts of max/min entropy on output and input densities being conceptually straightforward.
- The numerical experiments conducted are reasonable and validate the proposed principles.
- The derivation of the image representation algorithm from fundamental principles of machine learning is a significant strength.

Weaknesses:
- The paper begins with a questionable dichotomy between information transmission and sensory probability density modeling, neglecting existing literature that integrates these concepts.
- The transition from one or two pixels to full image patches introduces complexity that may not be adequately justified.
- The reliance on binary coding raises doubts about its theoretical relevance to real neural coding, as spike counts/rates are typically the informative variables.
- The application of the method to very elementary signals limits its relevance to understanding biological networks and their processing capabilities.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the contextualization of their work by discussing how their approach fits within existing literature, particularly the studies by Ganguli and Simoncelli and Yerxa et al. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the novelty of their optimization approach in relation to established probabilistic optimization methods. The authors should also address the limitations of their approach and provide insights into how their findings relate to biological neural coding, including testable predictions. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the terminology used, such as "even code," and ensure that the presentation is more accessible to enhance understanding.
