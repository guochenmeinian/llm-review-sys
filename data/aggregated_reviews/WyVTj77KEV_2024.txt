Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents PocketFlow, a generative model for protein pocket generation that incorporates protein-ligand interaction priors through flow matching. The authors propose a method that enhances the structural validity and binding affinity of generated pockets by integrating affinity and geometric guidance during sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate PocketFlow's generalizability across various ligand modalities, including small molecules, peptides, and RNA, achieving notable improvements in performance metrics such as Vina score and scRMSD.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- PocketFlow leverages domain knowledge, enhancing pocket generation quality through geometric constraints, which is a novel approach.
- The model extends pocket generation to various ligand modalities, effectively improving generalization capabilities.
- Experimental results show significant advantages over state-of-the-art methods, with an average improvement of 1.29 in Vina score and 0.05 in scRMSD.
- The algorithm is clearly described, and preliminary code is provided for reproducibility.
- Comprehensive ablation studies validate the contributions of affinity/geometry guidance and protein-ligand interaction learning.

Weaknesses:
- The backbone model is adapted from existing work, reducing its novelty.
- PocketFlow is pretrained only on protein-small molecule datasets; training on a combination of protein-small molecule/peptide/RNA datasets could enhance performance.
- Representation of peptide/RNA ligands as molecules may limit the model's effectiveness; applying frame representation for protein residues to these ligands could be beneficial.
- The time cost of PocketFlow compared to baseline methods and the potential computational burden of prior knowledge-based guidance are not addressed.
- Some metrics in experiments do not outperform RFDiffusionAA, raising questions about the robustness of results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of PocketFlow by exploring alternative backbone models beyond those adapted from existing work. Additionally, we suggest training PocketFlow on a more diverse dataset that includes protein-peptide and RNA interactions to potentially enhance its performance. The authors should clarify the representation of peptide/RNA ligands and consider applying frame representation for these ligands. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide detailed information regarding the time costs associated with PocketFlow and baseline methods, as well as the computational implications of the guidance mechanisms used. Lastly, elaborating on the sidechain ensemble for interaction geometry calculation would strengthen the clarity of the methodology.
