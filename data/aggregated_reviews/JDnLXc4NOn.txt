Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to Few-shot Learning with Auxiliary Data (FLAD) by formulating the selection of auxiliary datasets as a multi-armed bandit problem, utilizing exploration-exploitation algorithms. The authors propose two algorithms, EXP3-FLAD and UCB1-FLAD, which achieve computational complexity independent of the number of auxiliary datasets, thereby enhancing model generalization. The experimental results demonstrate that these methods surpass existing FLAD techniques by 4% and yield the first 3 billion parameter language models that outperform the 175 billion parameter GPT-3.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study introduces a significant enhancement to few-shot learning by effectively leveraging auxiliary data, improving model generalization.
- The exploration/exploitation framework addresses scalability issues, ensuring computational complexity remains manageable regardless of the number of auxiliary datasets.
- Experimental results provide strong empirical support for the proposed methods, showcasing their universal applicability across various language models.

Weaknesses:
- The interpretation of results in Figure 2 is complex, revealing task-dependent performance variations that lack thorough discussion or ablation studies.
- The novelty of the approach is somewhat incremental, as the multi-armed bandit technique is already established.
- Presentation issues exist, particularly regarding the clarity of definitions and the computational cost claims, which may lead to confusion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation, particularly in distinguishing between FLAD and similar problems such as general few-shot learning and multi-task learning. Additionally, we suggest providing more experimental results to illustrate the scalability of the proposed method with varying values of |\mathcal{A}| or |\mathcal{D}_T|. Furthermore, addressing the concerns regarding the computational cost and the interpretation of task performance in Figure 2 would enhance the paper's rigor. Finally, exploring a more flexible policy for selecting auxiliary datasets could yield valuable insights into performance variations across tasks.
