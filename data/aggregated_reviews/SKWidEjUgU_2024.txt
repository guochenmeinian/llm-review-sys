### Key Points
This paper presents a significant security vulnerability in Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, specifically regarding expert routing strategies that utilize cross-batch data. The authors convincingly demonstrate the risk of exploitation through adversarial queries to manipulate model outputs, supported by a well-structured proof-of-concept attack in a toy setting. They propose several mitigation strategies, contributing to the field of machine learning security by addressing a previously underexplored issue.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The identification of a critical security vulnerability in MoE models is a substantial contribution.  
- The proof-of-concept attack is well-structured and effectively illustrates the risk.  
- The paper has practical implications for machine learning security.

Weaknesses:  
- Experiments are limited to simplistic scenarios.  
- There is a need for broader experimental validation.  
- The exploration of the trade-offs associated with the proposed mitigation techniques is insufficiently detailed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental validation by including more complex scenarios to better assess the vulnerability. Additionally, a more thorough exploration of the trade-offs related to the proposed mitigation strategies would enhance the paper's contributions.
