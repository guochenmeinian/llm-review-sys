### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to few-shot node classification, termed Contrastive Few-Shot Node Classification (COLA), which integrates graph contrastive learning with meta-learning techniques. The authors propose a framework that constructs meta-tasks without relying on label information, leveraging three augmented graphs to enhance the utilization of graph nodes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of COLA, achieving state-of-the-art results across various tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The COLA framework is a simple yet effective solution for few-shot graph learning, showing strong performance improvements over existing meta-learning and contrastive learning methods.
2. The method effectively utilizes information from all nodes in the graph, promoting a comprehensive understanding of the graph structure.
3. The paper is well-organized and includes detailed analyses of the proposed method and its components.

Weaknesses:
1. The rationale for using three augmented views lacks theoretical backing, raising concerns about its necessity and effectiveness.
2. The paper does not sufficiently compare with recent methods in the field, such as "Contrastive Meta-Learning for Few-shot Node Classification" and "Graph few-shot learning with task-specific structures."
3. Limited discussion on the challenges associated with the proposed framework and the computational complexity introduced by using three augmented graphs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical justification for the use of three augmented views in their framework. Additionally, providing a deeper analysis of why COLA outperforms previous meta-learning methods would enhance the paper's impact. It would be beneficial to include comparisons with more recent state-of-the-art methods and to discuss the implications of computational complexity more thoroughly. Finally, expanding the empirical validation to include a broader range of datasets and scenarios with limited labeled data would strengthen the overall assessment of the proposed method.
