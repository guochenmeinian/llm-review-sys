Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents finite sample guarantees for recovering the latent causal graph and latent variables under stochastic soft interventions and unknown linear transformations. It extends identifiability analysis from the infinite sample regime to the finite sample regime, proposing three algorithms: causal order estimation, graph estimation, and inverse transformation estimation. The authors establish PAC-style bounds on identifiability and conduct numerical assessments to complement their findings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper significantly advances identifiability analysis by addressing the finite sample regime, enhancing practical applicability.  
- The contributions are clearly articulated, and the theoretical results are well-organized, making the paper easy to follow.  

Weaknesses:  
- The established bounds are loose, limiting practical applicability and providing insufficient guidance for designing better algorithms.  
- The experimental section lacks detail, and the small scale of experiments (up to 10 nodes) raises concerns about generalizability.  
- Several notations are undefined, complicating comprehension, and the clarity of threshold settings for score estimates is questionable.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of threshold settings for \(\eta\) and \(\gamma\), ensuring that their dependence on unknown true scores is well-explained. Additionally, we suggest providing more detailed discussions on the assumptions and addressing the implications of the loose bounds on practical applications. It would be beneficial to expand the experimental section to include more comprehensive details and larger-scale experiments. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the definitions of notations and consider comparing their infinite-sample results with existing work to strengthen the paper.
