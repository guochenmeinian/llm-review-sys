### Key Points
This paper presents a sampling framework from a convex body with a barrier and introduces a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for estimating the probability of a high-dimensional polytope under a log-concave probability distribution. The authors propose improvements in mixing time while maintaining the best-known per-iteration cost, utilizing a spectral approximation of the Hessian matrix. The main result indicates that the iteration complexity to converge to a $\delta$-TV-approximate distribution is $\widetilde{O}(\nu d + d L^2 R^2)\log(1/\delta)$, with each step having runtime $C_g + d^{\omega}$. The work also addresses the mixing times for spectrahedrons and emphasizes the significance of the barrier's properties.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper tackles an important problem in the geometry of polytopes, presenting significant quantitative improvements over prior work. The conditions for obtaining mixing times are general and depend on natural properties of the barrier function.

Weaknesses:  
The improvement is somewhat incremental, and there are several areas where further clarification is needed, such as the motivation for the problem and the benefits of using the Hessian in the design of the walk.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for the problem to appeal to a broader CS audience. Additionally, please provide more intuition about the benefits of using the Hessian in the design of the walk and elaborate on the hardness of constructing the Hessian of the universal barrier. Clarification is needed for specific lines and equations throughout the paper, including Lines 154-156, Line 15 on Page 5, and Lines 196, 202 regarding symmetry and convexity properties. We also suggest providing a more extensive discussion on future work, particularly regarding the potential for better mixing times under more structural assumptions and runtime improvements through recycling Hessian computations.
