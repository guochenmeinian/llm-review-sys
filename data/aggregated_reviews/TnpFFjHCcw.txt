### Key Points
This paper presents a semantic parser for knowledge-based question answering (KBQA) that utilizes dynamic context modeling with knowledge graph (KG) subgraphs encoded via a graph neural network. The authors propose a context-dependent approach to type linking, which is efficient and scalable. The paper explores conversational semantic parsing over general-purpose KGs, addressing an under-researched area and demonstrating promising results in handling conversational features like ellipses and co-references.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written, coherent, and easy to understand.  
- It provides a thorough evaluation with strong experimental results, including a detailed ablation study and insightful analysis.  
- The architecture is clearly defined, and the authors plan to release code and data.  
- The approach presents a novel method with strong performance and clear motivation.  

Weaknesses:  
- The improvement largely stems from disambiguation based on entity popularity in training data, necessitating more experiments to assess generalizability on new datasets and unknown entities.  
- The analysis lacks a comparison with LasagneSP, a similar model, which is critical for contextualizing the novelty of the proposed dynamic graph approach.  
- The model design is perceived as lacking novelty, and some minor points require additional support or detail.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with LasagneSP to highlight the differences between global and dynamic graphs. Additionally, we suggest conducting further experiments to evaluate the model's generalizability on new datasets and unknown entities. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the queries in Figure 1 by incorporating node names directly or providing an earlier explanation to enhance understanding.
