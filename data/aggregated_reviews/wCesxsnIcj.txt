### Key Points
This paper presents the TransBox model, which addresses limitations of existing geometric-based models by ensuring $\mathcal{EL}$++ closure and effectively representing many-to-many relationships through box embeddings. The authors demonstrate that TransBox can flexibly handle various role types, outperforming TransE-based models. The approach is significant for generating ontology embeddings that support complex concepts and logical constraints, enhancing tasks such as axiom prediction and question answering.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The model effectively overcomes limitations of existing approaches, supported by clear theoretical proofs.
- Experimental results indicate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art models, particularly in complex axioms.
- The soundness of the model is well-articulated, preserving logical consistency for ontology axioms.
- Extensive experiments on biomedical datasets showcase state-of-the-art performance.

Weaknesses:
- Section 6 lacks sufficient explanations for the experimental results, particularly regarding Table 8.
- The rationale for not comparing Box2EL in Tables 3â€“6 is unclear, as is the exclusion of comparisons with the $\mathcal{ALC}$-ontology model.
- Comparisons with ball-based methods are relegated to the appendix, and scalability to larger ontologies is not thoroughly discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve Section 6 by providing clearer explanations for the experimental results, particularly clarifying any potential typos regarding table references. Additionally, we suggest including a rationale for the exclusion of Box2EL and the $\mathcal{ALC}$-ontology model in the comparisons. A direct comparison with ball-based methods in the main text would strengthen the analysis, and a discussion on the scalability of TransBox to larger or dynamic ontologies should be included.
