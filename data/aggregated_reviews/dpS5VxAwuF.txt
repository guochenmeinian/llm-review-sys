### Key Points
This paper addresses the challenge of embodied task completion by predicting actions based on natural language instructions and visual observations. The authors propose a plan prediction variant, demonstrating that multimodal transformer models trained on synthetic data achieve strong zero-shot performance. The study highlights the potential of synthetic dialogue generation to mitigate data scarcity in embodied AI, showing that models trained on this data can outperform those trained on real data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper tackles an important issue of data scarcity in embodied AI research.  
- It presents solid engineering work in generating dialogue and trajectory data.  
- Thorough experiments yield convincing results, indicating that machine-generated data can effectively augment human-generated data.

Weaknesses:  
- The plan prediction task lacks novelty, as it has been previously explored in works related to the TEACh dataset.  
- The evaluation does not consider large language models, which may perform well on the plan prediction task.  
- The paper is challenging to read for those unfamiliar with the field, and the task variant simplifies the actual TEACh task, limiting the demonstration of the proposed method's effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the data generation section to enhance accessibility for readers less experienced in the field. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explore the potential of generating synthetic data using large language models and compare this approach with their proposed method to highlight its advantages. Finally, we advise the authors to refer to the simplified task as "EDH-Plan-Only" to avoid misleading comparisons with other studies utilizing the full EDH setting.
