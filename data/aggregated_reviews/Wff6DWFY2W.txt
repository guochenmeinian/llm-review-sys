Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for automating diagnosis coding using tree-based contrastive learning, specifically addressing the segmentation of clinical notes into sections. The authors utilize the MIMIC-III dataset and demonstrate that their approach enhances the performance of existing models, particularly under limited training data conditions. The paper includes comprehensive comparative performance evaluations and ablation studies, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and clearly explains the research motivation, related work, experimental configuration, and results.
- It employs a well-chosen range of machine learning methods, with clear and thorough descriptions of the methodologies.
- Empirical results are obtained with multiple baseline models on the benchmark dataset MIMIC-III, and code is provided.

Weaknesses:
- The qualitative analysis is lacking; extending Section 5 with a mixed-method approach would enhance the evaluation of experimental methods.
- The paper does not adequately discuss limitations, ethical considerations, or the broader context of the study.
- Result tables and plots lack confidence intervals, which are necessary for illustrating variance in model comparisons.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the qualitative analysis by extending Section 5 to include a mixed-method approach. Additionally, we suggest adding a dedicated discussion section to address limitations, ethical considerations, and the broader implications of the study. It would also be beneficial to connect this work to prior shared tasks and datasets in natural language processing to contextualize the findings. Finally, we advise including confidence intervals in result tables and plots to better illustrate the variance and significance of the results.
