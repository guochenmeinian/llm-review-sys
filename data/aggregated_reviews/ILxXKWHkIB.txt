### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to biomedical entity normalization, focusing on improving model performance for unseen entities. The authors propose a method that utilizes a mention and entity embedder to generate embeddings from training data, supplemented by a GAN model to create fake mention embeddings for unseen entities. This approach is further refined through a re-ranking step to enhance performance. The authors demonstrate improved results on unseen entities compared to strong baselines, supported by comprehensive ablation studies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed method is novel and effectively addresses the challenge of unseen entity normalization.  
- The presentation is clear and comprehensible, making the methodology accessible.  
- The ablation studies and analyses provide thorough insights into the model's components and their significance.  
- The experimental results show a marked improvement over previous models.

Weaknesses:  
- The presentation could benefit from refinement to enhance elegance and naturalness in expression.  
- The paper lacks a detailed discussion on the key motivation and novelty of the proposed framework.  
- There is a need for more robust significance analysis in the experimental results.  
- The potential application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this context is not addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the overall presentation by refining the language with the assistance of a native English speaker. Additionally, we suggest that the authors elaborate on the key motivation and novelty of their work. Including a robustness analysis in the experiments would strengthen the findings. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to discuss the implications of LLMs, such as GPT-4, for their proposed method.
