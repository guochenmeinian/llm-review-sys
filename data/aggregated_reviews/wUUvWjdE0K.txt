### Key Points
This paper presents the implementation of Legendre Spiking Neural Networks (LSNN) on the Loihi 2 neuromorphic system for time series classification, utilizing both Neuro-Cores and Lakemount CPUs. The authors describe modifications to the LSNN architecture to align with Loihi 2's capabilities, detailing the implementation of the Legendre Delay Network (LDN) on Lakemount cores, which support only 32-bit integer operations. The study evaluates 15 different time series classifications in terms of model accuracy, energy, and latency. While the methodology is thoroughly described, it is challenging to follow due to excessive acronyms. The contribution of different cores to latency and energy is analyzed, but a comparison of energy consumption with other systems is absent.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- LSNN implementation on Loihi 2 for time-series classification.  
- Utilization of Lakemount cores alongside Neuro-Cores.  
- Detailed assessment of various model variants, including accuracy, energy, and latency.  
- Code has been shared.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks clarity due to the overuse of acronyms.  
- The significance of findings is unclear as comparisons to state-of-the-art methods are incomplete.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by reducing the number of acronyms and technical details, particularly in Section 2.3 on LDN, which is very dense. The second bullet point of the contributions in the introduction should be checked for grammar. Additionally, prefixes such as “slyr,” “l2sim,” “l2h2,” and “LSTM-FCN” should be introduced in the table caption of Table 1. The authors should clarify why they only compare their results to LSTM-FCN and not more recent works. In Section 4.3, the criteria for highlighting results in bold should be explained, and the lack of highlight for E5000 should be addressed. We suggest moving detailed profiling information to an appendix to focus on energy and latency results in the main text. Finally, for a 6-page conference paper, we recommend reducing the number of benchmarks to allow for a more comprehensive explanation of the research.
