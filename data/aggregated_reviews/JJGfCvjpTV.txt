Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new generative modeling approach called Hamiltonian Score Matching (HSM), which is based on classical Hamiltonian mechanics. The authors propose a framework that interprets the score function as a force field, optimizing parameters to achieve a score-matching objective. They demonstrate that both Flow Matching and diffusion models are special cases of their framework and introduce Oscillation Hamiltonian Generative Flows (HGFs). Theoretical insights are validated through experiments on various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The formulation is novel, implying conservation of energy and volume.
- The theoretical foundation is solid, with clear derivations connecting diffusion models and flow matching to HGFs.
- The writing is clear and the presentation is easy to follow, with instructive figures.

Weaknesses:
- The resulting algorithm is somewhat similar to existing second-order methods, limiting its novelty.
- Experimental results are limited, particularly in image generation, where performance lags behind the EDM model.
- The use of harmonic oscillators lacks strong motivation, and the scalability of the approach is restricted by necessary trajectory simulations and min-max optimization.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by providing more diverse and robust results across different tasks, beyond the current limited scope. Additionally, we suggest elaborating on the motivation for using harmonic oscillators and considering alternative force field forms. It would also be beneficial to include a comparison of runtime and memory consumption with state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the influence of Hamiltonian dynamics on image generation, particularly regarding the roles of x and v.
