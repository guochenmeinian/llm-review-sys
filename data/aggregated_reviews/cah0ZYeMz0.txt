### Key Points
This paper presents BandRank, a novel ranking approach for dynamic graphs that utilizes a band-pass disentangled representation (BPDR) and a Harmonic Ranking (HR) loss. The authors propose that existing ranking methods struggle with modeling multi-scale temporal patterns and face gradient vanishing issues. BandRank addresses these challenges by decomposing temporal features into multiple frequency bands and employing non-shared frequency-enhanced MLPs for independent processing. The method demonstrates significant improvements in ranking performance across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is original and well-organized, with clear motivations and detailed schemes addressing prior method limitations.
2. The theoretical guarantees for the multi-scale learning capability of BPDR and the robustness of the HR loss enhance the credibility of the proposed method.
3. Extensive empirical results validate the effectiveness and robustness of BandRank compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The significance of Figure 2 in Challenge 1 is unclear, and the computational complexity of the proposed method is not discussed.
2. The definitions and determination of the three frequency bands lack clarity, hindering understanding of the learning process.
3. The interpretability of the BandRank model is not addressed, and a more detailed analysis of individual components is needed.
4. Comparisons with recent frequency-domain methods and time-domain methods are sparse, potentially weakening the assessment of BandRankâ€™s novelty.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the significance of Figure 2 and provide a detailed discussion on the computational complexity of BandRank, especially for large-scale dynamic graphs. Additionally, the authors should clarify how the frequency bands are determined and explore the interpretability of the model by identifying key features influencing ranking scores. A more thorough analysis of the impact of individual components, such as the band-pass filter and HR loss, would enhance understanding of their contributions. Finally, we suggest including comparisons with recent approaches and discussing the limitations of frequency-domain modeling to provide a balanced perspective.
