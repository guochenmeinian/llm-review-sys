Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a graph-based approach for Few-shot Semantic Segmentation (FSS) utilizing the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The authors propose a Positive-Negative Alignment module for point prompt selection and a Point-Mask Clustering module to align mask granularity with selected points. The method outperforms state-of-the-art models on COCO-20i and LVIS-92i datasets and shows strong performance on One-shot Part Segmentation and Cross Domain FSS datasets. Notably, the method is hyperparameter-free and efficient.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses the challenging problem of prompt engineering for vision foundation models, filling a significant gap in the research community.
2. The systematic design of the method, comprising three well-designed and novel modules, enhances its contribution.
3. The clarity of writing allows for easy comprehension of the modules.
4. Comprehensive experiments yield convincing results, particularly the significant performance improvement on COCO-20i and robust cross-domain validation.
5. The hyperparameter-free nature of the method increases its practical applicability.
6. The completeness of the submitted code enhances reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
1. The authors should provide visualization examples or experiments to support the claim regarding the efficacy of the PMC module, as stated in L173.
2. The definitions of weak or strong connected components in Table 4 are unclear, and further analysis is needed. Additionally, clarification on the hyperparameter for K-means++ and whether different hyperparameters were tested is required.
3. More experiments on part segmentation are necessary to further demonstrate the hyperparameter-free advantage, especially since previous SOTA Matchers require different hyperparameters.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of visualizations, particularly in Figures 1 and 2, to ensure consistency and informativeness. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on the mask merging process, detailing whether each point generates a mask individually or if clusters of points are used collectively. Finally, we suggest conducting further experiments on part segmentation to validate the proposed method's advantages over existing approaches.
