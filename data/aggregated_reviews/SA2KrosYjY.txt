Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for improving out-of-distribution (OOD) detection by learning both perceptual and spurious contexts. The authors propose a new loss function that integrates these contexts to enhance classification accuracy for both in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. The empirical validation demonstrates strong performance on various OOD benchmarks, indicating the method's effectiveness in addressing the challenges of OOD detection.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The empirical validation is robust, showcasing strong performance across OOD tasks.
- The integration of insights from previous works, such as the use of perturbed examples and learning prompts, adds originality to the approach.
- The writing is generally clear, and the experiments are comprehensive.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the proposed technique, CATEX, appears incremental compared to existing methods like NPOS, lacking distinct insights.
- Clarity issues exist, particularly regarding the methods section, which does not sufficiently explain the perturbation guidance or the hierarchical context mechanism.
- The paper does not adequately address the implications of using a single spurious context for diverse ID categories, nor does it provide sufficient visualizations of generated samples.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methods section by providing more detailed explanations of the perturbation guidance and how it differs from existing techniques. Additionally, we suggest including visualizations of generated samples to enhance understanding. The authors should also clarify the concept of hierarchical contexts and their role in OOD detection, as well as address the implications of using a single spurious context for varying ID categories. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore the sensitivity of the masking ratio in perturbation guidance, as this could significantly impact performance.
