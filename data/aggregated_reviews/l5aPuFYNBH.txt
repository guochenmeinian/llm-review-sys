### Key Points
This paper presents a Genre-aware Personalized neural Topic Model (GPTM) that integrates genre information into topic modeling to enhance the relevance of mined topics to product genres. The authors employ user-aware contrastive learning to improve user preference modeling, demonstrating superior performance on Amazon review datasets compared to nine baseline models. The results indicate improved coherence and diversity in topics while maintaining strong correlations with genres.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents innovative ideas that effectively combine personalization with topic modeling.
- The evaluation is extensive, utilizing three datasets and multiple metrics to validate the proposed method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The notation used throughout the paper is complex and inconsistent, making it difficult to follow.
- The definition and significance of "genre" are not clearly articulated, leading to potential confusion regarding its role in the modeling process.
- The dataset configuration and preprocessing steps lack clarity, particularly concerning the selection criteria for users and the statistical tests applied in the evaluation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the notation used in the paper, possibly by consolidating terms and providing clearer definitions. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed discussion on the concept of genre, including its definition and relevance to topic modeling. It would be beneficial to elaborate on the choices made regarding dataset preprocessing, including the rationale for retaining users with a specific number of comments. Finally, we suggest including information about the statistical tests performed in the evaluation to enhance the robustness of the results presented.
