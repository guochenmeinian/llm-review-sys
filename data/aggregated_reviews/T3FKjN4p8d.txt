### Key Points
This paper presents a multimodal dataset obtained using Intelligent Knee Sleeves for human pose estimation, proposing a baseline model that utilizes time-series data to predict 3D positions of major lower body joints, achieving an average error of 7.21 degrees. The authors evaluate the model's generalization ability through tests on unseen exercises and individuals, highlighting the dataset's potential for applications in healthcare and sports. Additionally, the authors introduce a novel approach to joint rotation prediction using machine learning-based wearable sensors, specifically targeting healthcare applications for patients with joint-related conditions. They emphasize the importance of precise joint angle rotation estimation over location error, focusing on quaternion predictions and Mean Squared Derivative (MSD) results. The integration of IMUs and pressure sensors is detailed, illustrating the contribution of each modality to model performance and arguing that their integrated device improves accuracy and simplifies calibration compared to traditional systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces a multimodal dataset for lower body motion estimation, integrating pressure sensors, IMU, and marker-based MoCap data, which may significantly benefit research in human pose estimation.  
- The trained ML model demonstrates effective generalization to unseen scenarios, showcasing the potential of knee-sleeve-based motion capture.  
- The unique focus on joint rotation estimation has potential healthcare applications, particularly for musculoskeletal patients.  
- The integration of IMUs and pressure sensors significantly enhances data accuracy and model performance.  
- The authors provide a thorough analysis of their methodology and results, including smoothness metrics.

Weaknesses:  
- The study lacks an evaluation of the performance of each sensor modality and how they contribute to the overall task, which is crucial for multimodal tasks.  
- Only rotation error is reported as an evaluation metric; mean per joint position error (MPJPE) and the smoothness of predicted results are also necessary metrics.  
- The paper does not adequately compare with existing works on lower-body/full-body pose estimation from sparse sensors, limiting the contextual understanding of its contributions.  
- The paper does not adequately address position error as a metric, which is essential for general human pose estimation.  
- The use of Mean Squared Derivative (MSD) as a measure of smoothness may not be appropriate; jerk is typically preferred for assessing jitter.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by investigating the contribution of different sensory channels, particularly the pressure data. Additionally, the authors should include mean per joint position error (MPJPE) and assess the smoothness of predicted results as evaluation metrics. It would also be beneficial to discuss existing related works as baseline models and highlight the differences between them and the presented work. Furthermore, diversifying the types of exercises included in the dataset and exploring hierarchical networks for independent treatment of IMU and pressure data could enhance the robustness of the findings. Lastly, we recommend that the authors improve the focus on position error as a metric to align with broader human pose estimation standards and consider incorporating jerk as a measure of smoothness, as it is more commonly used in the field. While the MSD is justified in the context of joint rotation, exploring the relevance of jerk could enhance the robustness of the analysis.
