Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a multi-objective optimization framework aimed at enhancing fairness in the estimation of graphical models, specifically Gaussian, Gaussian Covariance, and Binary Ising models. The authors argue that traditional graphical models often propagate biases and do not inherently consider fairness. They propose integrating a pairwise graph disparity error and a tailored loss function into a non-smooth optimization problem to systematically mitigate these biases while balancing loss minimization and pairwise graph disparity. The method is theoretically grounded, achieving weak Pareto optimality and demonstrating convergence rates. The authors also highlight the computational complexity of their approach, particularly in high-dimensional settings, and discuss real-world applications of their method. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach reduces bias while maintaining model performance across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Originality in addressing fairness in graphical models, a relatively under-explored area in fair machine learning.
- Theoretical robustness, with proofs of weak Pareto optimality and global convergence rates.
- Clear motivation and innovative integration of fairness metrics into a multi-objective optimization framework.
- Practical applications demonstrating the relevance of the proposed method in real-world scenarios.
- Acknowledgment of computational challenges with proposed strategies to enhance efficiency.

Weaknesses:
- The optimality analysis relies on the convexity of the loss function, leaving the impact of non-convex loss functions unclear.
- Limited experimental baselines, with only one baseline from 2012, which could be strengthened by including more contemporary methods.
- Insufficient discussion on fairness metrics and their implications, particularly regarding the choice of disparity error.
- The justification for the trade-off between fairness and accuracy is not sufficiently addressed, particularly in light of existing literature.
- The learning algorithm is noted to be time-consuming, raising concerns about scalability and applicability to larger datasets.
- The focus on only three types of graphical models limits the generalizability of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the implications of using non-convex loss functions and how this might affect the performance of their method. Additionally, we suggest incorporating more modern baselines in the experimental section to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed framework. Clarifying the choice of fairness metrics and addressing the potential impact of small sample sizes on local graph estimates would enhance the paper's rigor. We also recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the trade-off between fairness and accuracy by explicitly addressing findings from the literature, such as the work by S. Dutta et al. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide a more detailed complexity analysis, particularly regarding high K and P values and the implications of having numerous protected groups. Lastly, we recommend that the authors clarify the rationale for focusing solely on Gaussian models and consider discussing the applicability of their method to directed graphs and alternative fairness criteria beyond equal loss among subgroups.
