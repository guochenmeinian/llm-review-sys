### Key Points
This paper presents a benchmark suite for evaluating machine learning models in enzyme function prediction, focusing on two tasks: classification of protein sequences by Enzyme Commission (EC) number and retrieval of EC numbers from chemical reactions. The authors propose a new contrastive learning framework, CREEP, for the retrieval task, demonstrating its effectiveness against existing baselines without data leakage. However, the datasets used for these tasks have been previously curated, limiting the novelty of the contribution.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a novel task for enzyme retrieval based on reactions.
- Carefully designed train-test splits that evaluate out-of-distribution generalization.
- A well-documented codebase and clear presentation of figures, enhancing interpretability.

Weaknesses:
- The datasets for both tasks lack novelty as they have been curated in prior works.
- The new model CREEP does not incorporate structural data, which is crucial for understanding protein function.
- The small number of test samples raises questions about the robustness of the evaluation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset by addressing the filtering criteria for protein sequences, specifically clarifying the rationale behind excluding sequences longer than 650 amino acids. Additionally, the authors should consider including recent models like ProTrek in their benchmarks and explore the potential benefits of incorporating structural data into the CREEP framework. Furthermore, providing a naive baseline for EC label prediction could enhance the understanding of class balance in the dataset. Lastly, we suggest clarifying the methodology for generating test sets and the implications of the promiscuous test set configuration.
