Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for reconstructing large-scale 3D scenes from a sparse set of posed images, utilizing a two-stage approach. The first stage involves voxel grid reconstruction based on the XCube model, incorporating image conditions. The second stage employs a feedforward appearance prediction model to generate Gaussians for each voxel, complemented by a GAN-based post-processing step to enhance visual quality. Evaluated on the Waymo self-driving dataset, the method demonstrates superiority over existing 3D reconstruction techniques and showcases applications such as LiDAR simulation and text-to-scene generation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method effectively addresses the challenge of reconstructing large-scale 3D scenes from sparse images, leveraging a pre-trained 3D diffusion generative model to mitigate ill-posedness.
- The framework combines voxel grid reconstruction with appearance prediction, yielding promising results.
- The paper is well-written, providing clear explanations of the methodology and experiments.

Weaknesses:
- The abbreviation "VoxSplats" is confusing, as "splatting" typically refers to a rendering technique rather than a 3D representation; a more accurate term is recommended.
- The separation of foreground and background is unclear, particularly regarding the treatment of buildings as background in the supplementary video; further explanation is needed.
- Inconsistencies in lighting, exposure, and white balance are evident in the reconstructed scenes, necessitating a discussion of these limitations.
- The consistency of rendered views in SCube+ is uncertain, and the time-consuming GAN-based post-processing may compromise real-time rendering performance; these issues should be addressed.
- The evaluation of geometric accuracy of the reconstructed scenes is missing, which is crucial for application viability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the term "VoxSplats" to better reflect the representation used. Additionally, provide a detailed explanation of how foreground-background separation is achieved, particularly regarding the treatment of buildings. Discuss the limitations related to lighting, exposure, and white balance variations in the input images. Address the consistency of rendered views in SCube+ and the impact of the GAN-based post-processing on rendering performance. Finally, include a thorough evaluation of the geometric accuracy of the reconstructed scenes to enhance the paper's contributions.
