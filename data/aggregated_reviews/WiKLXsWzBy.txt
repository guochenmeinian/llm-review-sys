### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the multilingual capabilities of LLMs, focusing on performance disparities across languages. The authors propose a novel prompt back-translation method to systematically assess these disparities, categorizing language-dependent abilities into Reasoning, Knowledge Access, and Articulation. The study provides both quantitative and qualitative analyses of LLMs' multilingual abilities and situates its findings within the linguistics typology of bilingualism and multilingualism.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces a systematic approach for analyzing multilingual abilities in LLMs using the response back-translation (RBT) method, offering valuable insights into LLM performance across languages.  
- The experimentation is carefully designed, and the questions posed are highly relevant to current research in computational linguistics.  
- The analysis of language models based on linguistic learning typologies is particularly suggestive and interesting.

Weaknesses:  
- The findings are based on experiments conducted on a specific LLM (GPT-3.5), raising concerns about the generalizability of the results across different models.  
- There is a lack of analysis of the state of the art in multilingualism literature, and the figures are not intuitive, which may hinder understanding.  
- The conclusions drawn from the experiments are debatable, and the paper may lack in-depth analysis of the underlying factors contributing to performance patterns.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the results presentation, particularly in distinguishing between the three types of multilingualism (translation-equivariant and translation-variant tasks). Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments on a broader range of LLMs to enhance the generalizability of the findings. A more thorough examination of calque effects would strengthen the argument regarding English-subordinate multilingualism. Finally, we encourage the authors to include a more in-depth discussion on the underlying factors influencing observed performance patterns and to clarify the relationship between articulation, access, and reasoning in their task categorizations.
