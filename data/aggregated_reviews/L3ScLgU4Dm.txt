### Key Points
This paper presents a study on long-term fairness in recommendation systems, specifically addressing retention depolarization through a proposed RL-based framework, ReFair. The authors aim to ensure long-term retention fairness while optimizing recommendation performance. The work formulates the problem as a constrained MDP and introduces a surrogate optimization problem to enhance policy effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The focus on long-term fairness, particularly retention depolarization, is novel and practically significant.
2. The proposed method outperforms various baselines, including short-term fairness methods and RL-based heuristics, in both fairness and performance.
3. The paper includes both empirical results and theoretical analysis, providing a solid foundation for its claims.

Weaknesses:
1. Key concepts such as “groups” and “retention fairness” are not clearly defined early in the paper, which may hinder reader comprehension.
2. Notations and descriptions require improvement for clarity, particularly regarding the initial user state distribution and the varied meanings of the notation “a.”
3. The assumption that retention depolarization is always beneficial is questionable, as it may lead to harmful content exposure for certain user groups.
4. The reliance on offline datasets for environment modeling may not adequately capture real-world dynamics, raising concerns about the applicability of the findings.
5. The methodology does not sufficiently address the complexities of user preferences and intersectionalities within and between groups.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of key terms such as “groups” and “retention fairness” by providing upfront definitions. Additionally, we suggest refining notations to avoid ambiguity, particularly regarding the initial user state distribution and the diverse meanings of “a.” It would be beneficial to empirically validate the assumption that retention fairness is crucial for long-term success through case studies or literature. The authors should also address how their model adapts to rapidly changing user preferences and consider the implications of intersectionality in user groups. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore the feasibility of their approach in real-world scenarios, particularly regarding the limitations of offline datasets and the potential drawbacks of retention depolarization.
