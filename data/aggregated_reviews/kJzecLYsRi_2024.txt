Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a rigorous analysis of the convergence rate of spectral methods, specifically kernel ridge regression (KRR) and kernel gradient flow (KGF), in large-dimensional settings where the sample size $n$ is comparable to a power $\gamma$ of the input dimension $d$. It identifies a saturation effect unique to large dimensions, demonstrating that KRR experiences this effect while KGF does not. The authors utilize analytic filter functions to characterize regressors from various spectral algorithms and apply standard concentration results on the bias-variance decomposition of excess risk.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides solid theoretical results that enhance previous literature and reveal novel phenomena, such as the interpolation of the learning rate between KRR and KGF and the descriptions of *periodic plateau behaviour* and *polynomial approximation barrier*.
- It includes numerical validations supporting its claims.
- The manuscript identifies several phenomena in large-dimensional spectral algorithms, illustrated effectively through figures.

Weaknesses:
- Concerns arise regarding the novelty of the results, as some theorems appear to be extensions of previous work, raising questions about the technical contribution and suitability for conference publication.
- The presentation of results is slow, particularly on page 7, which may hinder clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their contributions by clearly delineating how their results extend beyond existing literature. Additionally, consider conducting preliminary experiments to confirm the saturation effect in KRR, as this could enhance the manuscript's empirical support. We also suggest revising the presentation to ensure that key results are stated more succinctly and clearly, particularly in the early sections of the paper. Lastly, addressing the technical questions raised, such as the independence of terms in Eq (62) and potential typos in Eq (42), would strengthen the manuscript's rigor.
