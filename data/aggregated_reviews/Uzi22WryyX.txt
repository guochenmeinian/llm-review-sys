Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of how label noise affects the Rashomon ratio, which is the fraction of models in the Rashomon set that perform similarly. The authors argue that increased label noise leads to higher expected variance in the performance of empirical risk minimizers (ERMs), prompting practitioners to favor simpler models that exhibit higher Rashomon ratios. Additionally, the authors introduce a pattern diversity metric to quantify the diversity of prediction patterns within the Rashomon set and provide empirical evidence supporting their claims across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and organized, addressing an important topic with significant implications for fields like criminal justice and healthcare.
- The theoretical results are empirically validated, enhancing the credibility of the findings.
- The introduction of a new Rashomon metric and the concept of pattern diversity are noteworthy contributions.
- The limitations section effectively contextualizes the study and outlines avenues for future research.

Weaknesses:
- The definition of a "simple model" is not provided, which could enhance clarity.
- Some claims lack broad proof, particularly regarding the generalization of results beyond the specific scenarios tested.
- The paper relies on a patchwork of assumptions, which weakens the overall conclusions.
- The connection between label noise and the Rashomon ratio needs more direct empirical evidence.
- Certain bounds presented are non-computable, and the implications of using different loss functions are not adequately discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction by defining or providing examples of "simple models." Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide empirical evidence directly linking label noise to the Rashomon ratio, possibly through a noise-to-metric plot. Clarifying the assumptions made in the analysis and discussing the implications of using various loss functions would strengthen the paper. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the motivation for defining pattern diversity and its connection to larger Rashomon ratios, as this is currently unclear. Lastly, including extensive experiments comparing black-box and interpretable models would bolster the practical applicability of the findings.
