### Key Points
This paper presents a diffusion model-based approach to address inverse problems in High Energy Physics (HEP), specifically for reconstructing kinematic quantities. The authors propose a unified framework that combines the latent diffusion model and variational diffusion model, achieving state-of-the-art performance through end-to-end training. The methodology is benchmarked against other algorithms, demonstrating significant improvements in unfolding semi-leptonic tt events.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-structured, with clear definitions and figures.  
- The proposed VLD algorithm significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms, as evidenced by extensive testing on an important HEP inverse problem.  
- The authors provide a deliberate construction of their network, explaining the advantages of each component.  

Weaknesses:  
- Limited testing of the proposed architecture raises concerns about its generalizability; further benchmarks on different event topologies are needed.  
- The technical novelty appears limited, primarily revolving around the introduction of an extra loss term in the diffusion model.  
- The experiments do not sufficiently support the claim that the benefits of VLD stem from the unified training process, particularly regarding the comparison with LDM.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the testing of their unifying architecture by including at least one more benchmark on different event topologies to enhance confidence in the algorithmâ€™s performance. Additionally, please clarify the definitions of variables such as energy, mass, and momentum, and discuss the reasons behind the performance differences between UC-VLD and VLD. It would be beneficial to present results for VLD alongside UC-VLD in the figures to clarify which model is preferred. An ablation study should be conducted to justify the claim regarding the deterministic encoder's superiority over the variational encoder. Finally, explicitly state the limitations of the proposed model to provide a clearer understanding of its applicability.
