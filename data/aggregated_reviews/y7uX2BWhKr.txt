### Key Points
This paper presents the Adaptive Neural Ranking Framework (ARF) as a novel approach to optimize cascade ranking systems in online advertising and recommendation scenarios. The authors propose a multi-task learning framework that combines the optimization of relaxed and full targets, utilizing a permutation matrix and differentiable sorting techniques. The introduction of the LRelaX surrogate loss is a significant contribution, addressing limitations of traditional learning-to-rank methods. The effectiveness of ARF is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on various datasets, including real-world applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles the important problem of optimizing business metrics in cascade ranking systems.
- The introduction of the LRelaX surrogate loss offers a novel method for optimizing rankings.
- The ARF framework robustly optimizes both relaxed and full ranking targets using multi-task learning.
- Comprehensive experiments validate the proposed methods' effectiveness across public and industrial datasets.

Weaknesses:
- Some implementation details, such as model architecture and training methodology, are missing.
- Additional ablation studies could provide insights into the contributions of individual components.
- The public datasets require substantial pre-processing for cascade ranking, but the impact of these alterations is not analyzed.
- Certain hyperparameters appear arbitrarily set, lacking justification; a sensitivity analysis could help identify optimal configurations.
- Online experiments utilize a single baseline, and comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods would enhance the analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by including a pseudocode section or a framework diagram to outline the algorithmic steps of the ARF multi-task learning framework. Additionally, exploring whether ARF outperforms more advanced differentiable sorting methods would add depth to the discussion. To enhance the rigor of the evaluation, the authors should provide insights into the training, inference, and storage overhead associated with ARF. Finally, addressing the writing issues, such as using an updated template and ensuring proper spacing between citation numbers and content, would improve the overall presentation.
