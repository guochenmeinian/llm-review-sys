Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of multicalibration algorithms to achieve distributional robustness concerning both concept and covariate shifts. The authors propose that subgroups can be defined as functions of both features \(X\) and labels \(Y\). They provide numerous theoretical results, including theorems demonstrating the conditions under which multicalibration guarantees good predictive performance across various distributions. Additionally, the authors introduce an optimization framework for post-processing models to achieve multicalibration and validate their approach through experiments on datasets like PovertyMap and ACSIncome.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work is original, particularly in considering maximal grouping function spaces and providing unique function space decomposition results.
- The paper develops substantial theoretical insights, particularly regarding density ratios in subgroup function classes.
- The proposed MC-Pseudolabel algorithm simplifies model selection and integrates well with existing frameworks.

Weaknesses:
- The empirical work is limited and may not convincingly demonstrate the robustness properties claimed.
- The complexity of the mathematical theories and assumptions may hinder broader audience comprehension.
- Clarity, organization, and discussion throughout the paper require significant improvement, particularly in the introduction and sections detailing results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by clearly motivating the connection between multicalibration and out-of-distribution generalization, addressing questions such as what benefits arise from applying multicalibration. An explicit discussion of related work in the introduction would also enhance clarity. 

We suggest providing more intuitive explanations and interpretations of results, especially in Section 4, to aid reader comprehension. The authors should clarify the implications of the grouping functions being a linear space and the significance of the decomposition in Theorem 4.3. 

Additionally, we encourage the authors to address the feasibility of the MC-PseudoLabel algorithm, including its correspondence with weak agnostic learning and the necessary assumptions for convergence. Finally, minor edits for clarity and precision throughout the paper should be made, particularly in the definitions and theorem statements.
