### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into measuring and mitigating hallucinations in multilingual summarization, particularly in cross-lingual transfer scenarios. The authors propose mFACT, a multilingual faithful metric developed from four English faithfulness metrics to detect hallucinations. They analyze the impact of cross-lingual methods on low-resource summarization, revealing that while these methods can enhance performance, they also exacerbate hallucinations. A novel mitigation approach is introduced, which weights training samples based on their faithfulness scores, demonstrating effectiveness in reducing hallucinations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is the first to study hallucination in cross-lingual transfer settings, potentially advancing related research.  
- The mFACT metric shows high accuracy in detecting hallucinations (95.3%).  
- The proposed mitigation method effectively reduces hallucinations in generated summaries.  
- Extensive experiments support the findings, and the paper is mostly well-written and easy to follow.  

Weaknesses:  
- The mFACT metric requires substantial English data for training, raising concerns about its generalization ability.  
- The experiments do not sufficiently support the claim that hallucinations are more prevalent in low-resource languages compared to English.  
- The complexity of the mFACT metric's creation and its practical application, including associated costs, are not adequately addressed.  
- Mixed results in Hindi and Turkish lack further clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of the mFACT metric by exploring its performance across various datasets beyond English. Additionally, the authors should conduct experiments to substantiate the claim that hallucinations are more pronounced in low-resource languages compared to English. Clarifying the complexity and practical application of the mFACT metric, including detailed discussions on costs and challenges, would enhance its usability. Finally, we suggest providing more insights into the mixed results observed in Hindi and Turkish to strengthen the overall analysis.
