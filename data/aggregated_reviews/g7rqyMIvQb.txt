### Key Points
This paper presents a study on machine learning for predicting Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using the MIMIC-IV dataset. The authors propose a methodology that incorporates demographic data and ICD codes, demonstrating the effectiveness of classical machine learning techniques, particularly the Random Forest Classifier, which achieved notable accuracy and AUC metrics. The paper provides a thorough background and detailed data analysis, with the code made available online.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Addresses a significant healthcare challenge with a robust methodological framework.
- Well-designed experiments with balanced training and test datasets across CKD stages.
- Clear statistical analysis supported by tables and figures.

Weaknesses:
- Limited to classical machine learning approaches without incorporating pre-trained models or advanced techniques like gradient boosted trees.
- Lacks a comparative analysis with state-of-the-art methods and does not address cost-effectiveness.
- The real-world application of the model is vague, and the chosen time point for prediction limits its clinical utility.
- Relies on ICD codes for ground truth, which may not accurately reflect clinical reality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the study by incorporating more advanced models, such as gradient boosted trees, to enhance performance comparisons. Additionally, a comparative analysis with state-of-the-art methods, including a cost reduction analysis, would enrich the paper's contribution. The authors should clarify the intended real-world application of their model and consider using traditional diagnostic criteria, such as creatinine and eGFR values, as a baseline for comparison instead of solely relying on ICD codes. This would strengthen the clinical relevance and accuracy of the predictive model.
