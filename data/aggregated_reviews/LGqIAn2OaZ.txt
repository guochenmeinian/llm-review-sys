Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for generating dynamic embeddings for multi-entity interactions, utilizing neural diffusion-reaction processes to model temporal high-order interactions. The authors propose a dynamic embedding approach based on a diffusion-based ODE model, which employs a multi-partite graph to coevolve trajectories while modeling individual object evolution through a reaction process. The proposed model effectively captures temporal dynamics, as demonstrated through comparisons with existing methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The ODE-based model provides a reasonable representation of embedding dynamics.
2. Dynamic embeddings are generated in continuous time, distinguishing this work from most existing approaches.
3. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed method outperforms baselines on three real-world datasets.

Weaknesses:
1. The presentation requires improvement; some phrases are unnecessarily repeated, while other points are covered too briefly. Additional proofreading is recommended.
2. The absence of source code complicates the reproducibility of results.
3. The novelty of the approach is questioned due to existing work on dynamic tensor decomposition not being adequately discussed or compared.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the text through thorough proofreading to eliminate redundancy and enhance the coverage of key points. Additionally, providing the source code would facilitate reproducibility. It would also be beneficial for the authors to discuss existing works on dynamic tensor decomposition, such as TANGO, to clarify the novelty of their approach. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors define notations more clearly, particularly the adjacency tensor W, and articulate the necessity of using multi-partite graphs in their model.
