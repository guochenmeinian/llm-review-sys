Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents BrainBits, an information-bottleneck pipeline designed to evaluate reconstruction performance from fMRI data by projecting it into a lower-dimensional space. The authors aim to discern whether advancements in fMRI-to-image/text reconstruction stem from improved signal extraction or enhancements in generative models. The method introduces a bottleneck of varying sizes to assess how reconstruction performance correlates with the bottleneck size, revealing that performance plateaus at a surprisingly small size, suggesting that current methods may rely more on model contributions than on effective neural information extraction.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a crucial question regarding the sources of progress in fMRI-based reconstruction, providing a novel method to characterize decoding performance.
- The quality of the work is generally high, with sufficient experimental results supporting the authors' claims.
- The writing is clear and well-organized, making the paper easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
1. The claim that better reconstruction can be achieved with fewer brain signals is questionable, as all signals are utilized in the models, and compressing signals does not guarantee fewer inputs.
2. The reliance on diffusion-based models for image decoding may skew results, as these models can generate images with significant randomness, complicating general conclusions.
3. The performance of brain-to-image generation is often unsatisfactory, with generated images lacking detail and structure compared to stimuli.
4. Limited sample sizes across subjects may affect the generalizability of results, as individual differences can lead to significant variability in reconstruction performance.
5. The adaptability of BrainBits to various neural recording modalities is uncertain, lacking experimental support.
6. Some figures, such as Figure 5, lack clear labeling, and others, like Figure 4, require explicit clarification regarding effective dimensionality.
7. Text occlusion in Figures 3 and 11 detracts from clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction, particularly in addressing the contradiction regarding signal requirements for reconstruction. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explore the implications of neural coding redundancy on their findings, particularly in relation to the effective dimensionality of neural activations. It would be beneficial to clarify the methods used for calculating the dimensionality of fMRI inputs and to address how much of this dimensionality reflects stimulus-related variability versus noise. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to consider generating images based on specific brain regions to strengthen their claims about the contributions of different areas to reconstruction performance. Lastly, enhancing the readability of figures, particularly Figure 3c and ensuring all text is legible, would improve the overall presentation of the paper.
