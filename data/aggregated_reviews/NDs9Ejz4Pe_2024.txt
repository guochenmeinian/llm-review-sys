Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Dispersing Prompt Expansion (DiPEx) approach aimed at enhancing class-agnostic object detection using vision-language models (VLMs). The authors identify that semantic overlap in manually crafted text queries can lead to undetected objects and propose a method to learn distinct, non-overlapping prompts. DiPEx begins with a generic parent prompt, expands it into child prompts, and employs dispersion losses to maintain inter-class discrepancy. The method utilizes maximum angular coverage (MAC) for prompt expansion and demonstrates significant improvements in average recall (AR) and average precision (AP) on MS-COCO and LVIS datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The DiPEx approach is innovative and addresses a critical issue in class-agnostic object detection.
2. The paper is well-structured, providing clear explanations of concepts, techniques, and experimental setups.
3. Extensive experimental results indicate the method's potential to advance the state-of-the-art in class-agnostic object detection.

Weaknesses:
1. The claim regarding "semantic overlap" as a cause for performance degradation lacks sufficient investigation, undermining the paper's fluidity. The authors should test the hypothesis by comparing semantically similar and dissimilar queries.
2. The motivation for merging queries to reduce computational cost would be more convincing with a comparison of inference costs between the proposed method, naive query-merging, and prediction-merging methods.
3. Some technical details are unclear, and there are numerous typos and inconsistent notations, particularly regarding subscripts in different sections.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the investigation of the "semantic overlap" hypothesis by conducting experiments comparing semantically similar and dissimilar queries. Additionally, including an inference cost comparison among the proposed method, naive query-merging, and prediction-merging would strengthen the paper's arguments. Clarifying technical details and ensuring consistent notation throughout the paper will enhance readability. Finally, providing more visualizations of the learned prompts and addressing the concerns regarding pseudo label updates during training would further solidify the contributions of this work.
