Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Multi-Task Diffusion Model, a diffusion-based method that integrates Transformer backbones and prompt learning for generative planning and data synthesis in multitask offline settings. The authors demonstrate the model's performance on the Meta-World and Maze2D benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over prior state-of-the-art baselines. The approach effectively combines planning and synthetic data generation, utilizing task-specific prompts to guide the diffusion model.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, providing a clear presentation of the method.
- It includes a thorough set of baselines and strong evaluations on challenging benchmarks like MT50.
- The method elegantly removes the need for one-hot task encoding through transition prompting, showing positive multi-task transfer in both planning and data generation.

Weaknesses:
- The distinction between the proposed model and PromptDT is inadequately explained, and additional environment and ablation experiments would strengthen the findings.
- The experiments primarily focus on custom settings with large datasets, lacking insights into minimum data requirements and evaluations on pre-existing offline datasets.
- The connection between multitask planning and synthetic data generation is not clearly established, as they utilize different RL algorithms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the differences between the proposed model and PromptDT. Additionally, conducting more comprehensive environment and ablation experiments would enhance the paper's credibility. It would be beneficial to evaluate the model on pre-existing offline datasets and report the minimum data required for effective performance. We also suggest including quantitative results for Maze2D unseen maps and clarifying the criteria for task selection in experiments. Lastly, addressing the limitations discussed in the appendix within the main text would improve clarity.
