### Key Points
This paper presents an integration of Bayesian Optimization (BO) with Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). However, the connection to MAML is not clearly articulated, particularly regarding its role in the fine-tuning stage. The authors propose a loss function that varies in its parameters, but the notation and explanation surrounding it are inconsistent and unclear. Additionally, the use of Probability of Improvement is noted as an uncommon choice in BO, warranting further justification and comparison with established methods like Expected Improvement (EI) and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The integration of BO with MAML is an interesting concept that could contribute to the field.  
- The topic has potential, indicating that the authors are addressing a relevant area of research.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks clarity in explaining key concepts, particularly MAML and the dataset D.  
- Notation inconsistencies create confusion regarding the loss function and its parameters.  
- The choice of Probability of Improvement is surprising and lacks justification.  
- The kernel description raises questions about its appropriateness, and the fitting of the GP to the regularized loss function is unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the connection to MAML, especially in the fine-tuning stage. It is essential to provide a comprehensive explanation of the dataset D, including its perturbations and noise. The authors should ensure consistent notation throughout the paper, particularly regarding the loss function parameters. We suggest justifying the choice of Probability of Improvement and comparing it with EI and UCB to address potential reader concerns. Additionally, a clearer explanation of the kernel's parameters and the fitting process for the GP, particularly in relation to regularization, would enhance the paper's rigor.
