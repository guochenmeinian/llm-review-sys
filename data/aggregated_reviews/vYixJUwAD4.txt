### Key Points
This paper presents a critical examination of the assumptions underlying the “Unified Theory” for the origin of grid cells, utilizing biological place cells derived from in vivo two-photon calcium imaging experiments. The authors claim that the unified theory presupposes translational invariance in place cells as a population and center-surround tuning in individual cells. Their findings indicate that biological place cells lack these properties, as evidenced by data in Figures 2 and 3. The authors suggest that biological grid cells may originate differently than the grid-like representations in artificial neural networks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The study provides an intriguing comparison between artificial and biological place cells, challenging the mathematical assumptions of the unified theory. The paper is well-structured, with robust experimentation and analysis, making it relevant to the workshop.

Weaknesses:  
The data analysis, particularly in Figure 3, lacks thoroughness and resembles a literature review rather than presenting original results. Concerns are raised regarding the use of virtual reality in studying grid and place cells, as the biological place cells are derived from head-fixed mice, which may not accurately represent free-moving rodents. Additionally, some statements, such as those in line 57, are difficult to understand.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental conditions and data collection in the manuscript to address Reviewer yHNMs' concerns. Additionally, please clarify how the projection step to Toeplitz matrix manifolds is performed in Eq. (1) and provide justification for using the l2 distance as the metric for projection and evaluating deviation from the assumption, given the specific PSD structure of autocorrelation matrices. Lastly, please clarify the meaning of "over-represent" in line 57.
