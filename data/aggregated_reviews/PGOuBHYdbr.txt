Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Thompson Sampling (TS) algorithm for linear combinatorial semi-bandit problems with sub-Gaussian rewards, achieving improved finite-time regret without exponential dependency on problem dimensionality. The authors explore the "mismatched sampling paradox," where divergence between assumed and actual reward distributions can enhance performance. Theoretical bounds and experimental results support the claims made.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant limitation in existing TS algorithms by avoiding exponential regret scaling, contributing meaningfully to the field.
- It establishes new regret bounds that enhance finite-time performance, supported by experimental validation.
- The organization and clarity of the presentation are commendable.

Weaknesses:
- The focus on the "mismatched sampling paradox" may overshadow the core contribution regarding exploration in CTS.
- The integration of the exploration boost into the analysis is not sufficiently clarified, and the proof strategy lacks synthesis.
- The paper's notation is dense, making it challenging for those outside the specific research area to follow.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how the exploration boost is integrated into the analysis and synthesize the proof strategy more effectively. Additionally, we suggest providing a summary of the algorithms as figures to enhance accessibility. It would be beneficial to clarify the specific conditions under which the results improve upon existing bounds, particularly in relation to [18]. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to offer intuitive explanations for the presented paradox and to highlight key techniques in the proof, distinguishing between standard and novel contributions. Lastly, consider addressing the notation-heavy aspects to facilitate understanding for a broader audience.
