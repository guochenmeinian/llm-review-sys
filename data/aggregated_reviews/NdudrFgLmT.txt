Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the security vulnerabilities within the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) caused by inconsistencies in the normalization process, particularly focusing on homoglyph attacks. The authors propose a method for automatically detecting and analyzing ENS normalization functions, highlighting the severity of these attacks compared to DNS. The analysis covers over 200 real-world Web3 applications, revealing that more than 60% exhibit inconsistencies, which could leave them vulnerable to exploitation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study is well-motivated and addresses a pertinent issue within the ENS ecosystem.
- The methodology for detecting normalization inconsistencies is sound and covers various cases.
- The paper is well-structured, making it easy to follow, and includes a novel tool for detecting discrepancies without source code access.

Weaknesses:
- The analysis lacks depth and does not yield significant insights into the practical implications of the findings.
- The dataset construction and selection of applications are unclear, raising concerns about representativeness and potential bias.
- The paper does not adequately discuss the exploitability of identified inconsistencies or provide a detailed description of the proposed tool's functionality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the dataset construction process and provide details on how the selected applications were chosen. Additionally, the authors should clarify which inconsistencies are exploitable and under what conditions. A more in-depth analysis of the practical implications of the findings, including the frequency and success rates of potential attacks, would strengthen the work. We also suggest that the authors explore potential mitigation strategies that could be implemented at the protocol level and provide a more detailed description of the tool's functionality. Lastly, a thorough review for grammar and spelling, particularly in Section 4, is advised.
