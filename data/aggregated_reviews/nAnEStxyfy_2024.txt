Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative approach to de-novo protein design by extending FrameFlow with projective geometric algebra for protein backbone generation. The authors propose a method that utilizes equivariant neural networks, specifically adapting the Invariant Point Attention (IPA) architecture with geometric algebra to enhance expressivity and performance. The experiments demonstrate slightly improved performance on standard protein generation benchmarks, although the results are only incrementally better than existing baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- **Clarity:** The paper is well-written, with high-level intuitions clearly explained despite the complex underlying mathematics.
- **Originality:** The integration of geometric projective algebra into the IPA architecture for protein design is a novel contribution.
- **Quality:** The experiments and baseline comparisons are appropriate, and the overall quality of the paper is commendable.
- **Significance:** The introduction of new architectural ideas is timely for the protein design field.

Weaknesses:
- The performance improvements are marginal, particularly on the designability metric, and the method does not outperform baselines in terms of diversity and novelty.
- The scalability of the proposed approach remains uncertain, as the trained models are small and the generated protein backbones are short.
- Lack of detailed information on model parameters and training hyperparameters limits understanding of the method's efficiency and scalability.
- The paper lacks comprehensive experiments on larger datasets, such as PDB, and does not adequately address the performance of the model on longer proteins.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the number of parameters in their model and provide detailed training hyperparameters, such as learning rates and batch sizes. Additionally, conducting experiments on the PDB dataset and increasing the protein length to 384 would provide valuable insights into the method's scalability and performance. We also suggest including an ablation study with different body orders and discussing relevant literature, such as the recent work by Mao et al., to strengthen the manuscript. Finally, a theoretical analysis comparing the proposed architecture with the original IPA would enhance the paper's robustness.
