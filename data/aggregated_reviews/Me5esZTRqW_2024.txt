Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to addressing covariate shift in conditional independence tests through the Covariate Shift Corrected Pearson Chi-squared Conditional Randomization (csPCR) test. The authors leverage importance weights and the control variates method to maintain asymptotic Type-I error control while enhancing power by reducing variance in the test statistic. The methodology is validated through theoretical and empirical studies, demonstrating superior performance in simulations and a practical application to a COVID-19 treatment dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces an original method for conditional independence testing under covariate shift, combining conditional randomization tests, importance weighting, and control variates.
- High-quality work is evidenced by rigorous statistical theories and comprehensive empirical validations.
- The paper is clearly written and well-organized, facilitating reader comprehension.

Weaknesses:
- The applicability of the csPCR method in real-world scenarios is limited, particularly when outcomes are easy to collect, raising questions about the necessity of the method in certain examples.
- The performance of the csPCR test is critically dependent on accurate density ratio estimations, which may be challenging in practical situations with limited or noisy data.
- The advantages of csPCR over simpler resampling methods are not clearly articulated, and the paper lacks experiments demonstrating Type-I error control in real datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of application examples by discussing more reasonable scenarios where csPCR is beneficial, supported by relevant references. Additionally, the authors should provide a detailed comparison between the csPCR test and traditional resampling methods that also utilize estimated density ratios, addressing the advantages of their approach. It would also be beneficial to include empirical validations across varied datasets to strengthen the claims of effectiveness. Lastly, we suggest that the authors clarify the assumptions regarding conditional independence in their problem setting to enhance reader understanding.
