Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel generalization bound that incorporates trajectory information during training, aiming to provide deeper insights into generalization error at various training stages. The authors analyze the increase in generalization error by linearizing the network and validate their theoretical assumptions through experiments on VGG13 trained on CIFAR-10. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, even with variations in learning rates and label noise levels.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- Originality: This is the first generalization bound utilizing the proposed approach, making it a significant contribution to the field.  
- Quality: The theoretical framework is solid, and the experiments are well-conducted, effectively validating the theoretical assumptions.  
- Clarity: The paper is generally understandable and well-structured.  
- Significance: The approach differs from existing works, providing a new set of theoretical techniques for practical generalization bounds in neural networks.  

Weaknesses:  
- The significance of the results is unclear without a numerical comparison of the bounds from Theorem 3.6 against prior work.  
- The small learning rate assumption is restrictive, aligning with some previous studies but limiting applicability.  
- Writing issues are present throughout the paper, including unclear phrases and typographical errors.  
- The experiments are limited in scope, lacking details on the models used for different datasets and the impact of learning rate schedulers on generalization error.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their writing by addressing the identified issues, such as unclear phrases and typographical errors. Additionally, we suggest providing a numerical comparison of the generalization bounds with prior work to establish significance. The authors should also consider expanding the experimental section to include more diverse neural network architectures and detailed descriptions of the models used. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to analyze the asymptotic behavior of the generalization bounds in common machine learning settings and to explore the applicability of their method to non-neural network models.
