Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new federated learning algorithm, EPISODE++, designed to enhance convergence speed while addressing client heterogeneity and allowing partial client participation. The authors provide theoretical proofs for the upper bound of convergence speed and demonstrate that EPISODE++ can achieve a linear speedup over standard methods like FedAvg. The extensive experimental results validate the theoretical findings, showing that EPISODE++ outperforms existing algorithms across various datasets and architectures.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The method improves upon the EPISODE algorithm by effectively addressing client heterogeneity and partial participation.
2. The authors provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of convergence properties, enhancing the credibility of the proposed algorithm.
3. The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the algorithm's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The experimental section lacks clarity on hyperparameter selection for baseline methods and does not explore performance with a larger number of clients.
2. The key motivation behind addressing bias from client heterogeneity is not clearly articulated, making it difficult to understand how the proposed algorithm mitigates this issue.
3. The experiments conducted with a limited number of clients (N=8) may not accurately reflect performance in large-scale federated learning scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by providing detailed explanations of how hyperparameters (learning rate, training steps) were selected for each method. Additionally, the authors should investigate and discuss the performance of EPISODE++ when the number of clients increases significantly, as well as its behavior with i.i.d. client data. Clarifying the motivation behind the bias introduced by client heterogeneity and how the proposed algorithm addresses this would also strengthen the paper. Finally, including error bars and indicating the number of repetitions in experiments would enhance the robustness of the reported results.
