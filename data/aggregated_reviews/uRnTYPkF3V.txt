Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on sequential probability assignment under logarithmic loss, focusing on adversarially generated contexts and labels. The authors introduce a new complexity measure, the "contextual Shtarkov sum," which characterizes the minimax regret and allows for the recovery and improvement of several known bounds with simpler proofs. They demonstrate that this minimax regret can be achieved using a contextual normalized maximum likelihood predictor, extending classical results to non-binary labels and arbitrary hypothesis classes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a fundamental problem in sequential probability assignment, providing significant results that could impact the community.
- It introduces a novel technique, Lemma A.3, which effectively characterizes the minimax value without relying on prior complexities.
- The robust characterization of minimax regret for arbitrary hypothesis classes is a notable strength.

Weaknesses:
- The contributions may be seen as somewhat incremental, with the Shtarkov complexity being well-known in transductive settings.
- The paper lacks experimental results to support theoretical findings, which could enhance its impact.
- Presentation issues exist, such as abrupt transitions to technical sections and insufficient motivation for concepts like multiary trees and the proposed cNML algorithm.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation by providing smoother transitions between sections and offering clearer motivations for key concepts, such as the utility of the cNML algorithm. Additionally, including experimental results comparing the performance of the cNML algorithm with traditional methods would strengthen the paper. Clarifying the novelty of the technical contributions and addressing the compactness condition in the proof of Theorem 3.2 would also enhance the clarity and rigor of the work. Finally, we suggest providing explicit examples, particularly regarding the multiary tree concept and the linear vs absolute-linear case, to illustrate the benefits of the new complexity measure.
