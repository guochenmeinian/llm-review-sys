Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the efficiency of first-price auctions, focusing on scenarios where bidders are either value maximizers or a mix of value and utility maximizers. The authors demonstrate that the price of anarchy (PoA) is 1/2 for all value maximizers and approximately 0.457 for mixed bidders. Additionally, they explore the implications of machine-learned reserves on bidders' values, providing various PoA guarantees based on these reserves.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant issue in the efficiency of first-price auctions, particularly in the context of auto-bidding, building on previous results by Jin and Lu (2022).
- It provides tight PoA results for both full and mixed auto-bidding scenarios, contributing solidly to the literature.
- The incorporation of machine-learned reserves is a valuable addition, with relevant results presented.

Weaknesses:
- The relationship between the PoA and the proportion of value and utility maximizers in mixed settings is unclear; the authors only provide the infimum of all PoAs without deeper analysis.
- The introduction lacks citations of relevant literature on auto-bidding, which diminishes the perceived significance of the contributions.
- The paper does not define the equilibrium considered for the PoA, leaving a gap in clarity.
- The proposed reserve price mechanism based on value is impractical, as it relies on unobservable bids.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the relationship between the PoA and the number of value versus utility maximizers in mixed settings by providing more detailed analysis. Additionally, we suggest that the authors enhance the introduction by including relevant literature on auto-bidding to better contextualize their contributions. It is also crucial to define the equilibrium considered in the PoA analysis explicitly. Finally, we advise the authors to reconsider the practicality of their reserve price mechanism, possibly exploring alternative methods that could be applied iteratively for more effective outcomes.
