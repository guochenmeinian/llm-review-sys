Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method called RealCompo for combining multiple diffusion models, specifically a text-to-image (T2I) model and a spatial-aware model, to enhance image realism and compositionality. The authors develop a balancer that dynamically merges predicted noise from both models during denoising, optimizing two sets of coefficients through a loss function that enforces spatial constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealCompo outperforms existing models in both realism and compositional generation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method bridges different models, supporting improved image generation.
2. It achieves state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative results.
3. The method is training-free and can be extended to stylized image generation.

Weaknesses:
1. The task definition is unclear, as different pre-trained T2I models yield varying realism, questioning the necessity of the proposed balancing method.
2. The motivation presented is unconvincing, relying heavily on a single existing method (GLIGEN) without considering other relevant approaches.
3. The contribution appears insufficient, as the optimization strategy resembles common practices in the field, with the primary distinction being the optimization of two coefficients rather than the latent variables.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the task definition, explicitly addressing why their method is necessary given existing models. Additionally, we suggest providing a more comprehensive motivation that includes a broader range of methods beyond GLIGEN. To enhance the contribution, the authors should clarify the differences between their approach and established techniques like "checkpoint merge" or "model ensemble." Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include a detailed explanation of Figure 1 and to elaborate on the computational efficiency of their method, particularly regarding gradient-based updates. Lastly, we recommend exploring the feasibility of a fixed coefficient strategy to eliminate the need for gradient backpropagation, potentially enhancing practical applications.
