### Key Points
This paper presents an algorithm called Graph Agnostic Causal Bayesian Optimization (GACBO), which performs Causal Bayesian Optimization (CBO) with unknown graphs for the cumulative regret objective. The authors maintain a model over the Structural Causal Model (SCM) using plausible models and graphs, which are utilized in the acquisition function to maximize the reward variable. The results indicate that GACBO is a promising approach, particularly when the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is unknown, as evidenced by its comparison with Model-Based Causal Bayesian Optimization (MCBO) using incorrect causal graphs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach of GACBO is innovative and addresses the challenge of unknown causal graphs effectively.
- The methodology is presented in a concise and readable manner, particularly in Section 3.
- The results demonstrate the robustness of GACBO compared to MCBO under incorrect assumptions about the causal graph.

Weaknesses:
- The definition of the posterior over graphs is unclear, and several formal assumptions are missing.
- The rationale for maximizing over plausible models and graphs instead of averaging is not provided.
- There are minor issues with terminology, notation, and clarity throughout the paper, including the use of "mutated graph" instead of "mutilated graph."

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definition of the posterior over graphs, making explicit the assumptions such as faithfulness and causal sufficiency. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on how they propose to calculate the expectations and variances in Equation 2. It would be beneficial to justify the definition of plausible graphs in greater depth and clarify how these graphs change over time, including the implications for convergence to the true graph. We also suggest that the authors address the computational complexity of their graph sampling algorithm and consider whether they are selecting both intervention variables and values. Lastly, we advise correcting minor issues related to terminology and notation throughout the paper.
