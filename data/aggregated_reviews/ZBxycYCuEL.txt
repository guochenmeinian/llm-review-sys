Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for measuring the stability of feature attribution methods in image classification tasks. The authors define "stable" explanations and introduce Multiplicative Smoothing (MuS) as a technique to ensure that classifier predictions remain consistent when features are added or removed. They propose the concepts of incremental stability and decremental stability to quantify this robustness. The efficacy of MuS is demonstrated through experiments, showing its ability to provide stability guarantees for classifiers.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper clearly articulates its objectives and provides a simple, well-explained solution with strong theoretical justification.
2. The introduction of incremental and decremental stability is novel and addresses inconsistencies in existing additive masking methods.
3. The empirical results effectively illustrate the benefits of the proposed approach, and the writing is generally clear and polished.

Weaknesses:
1. The definition of smoothness lacks clarity, particularly regarding its implications for classification outputs when features are removed.
2. The experiments require further clarification to elucidate what is being tested and the rationale behind it.
3. The accuracy penalty associated with multiplicative smoothing is significant, which may limit practical applicability, especially for critical classifiers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definition of smoothness and its implications for classification stability. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed explanation of the experimental setup and the specific aspects being tested. Addressing the accuracy drop associated with multiplicative smoothing is crucial; exploring denoising methods or augmentations that align with smoothing noise could enhance the practical significance of the results. Lastly, incorporating more illustrative figures or examples to convey the intuition behind stability would benefit the reader's understanding.
