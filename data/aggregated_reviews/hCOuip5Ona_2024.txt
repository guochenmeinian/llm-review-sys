Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CutSSL, a novel framework for graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) that addresses the limitations of Laplace learning algorithms, particularly their performance at low label rates and in imbalanced class scenarios. The authors propose a continuous nonconvex quadratic programming approach inspired by cardinality-constrained minimum-cut graph partitioning. The framework utilizes the ADMM method for optimization, demonstrating superior performance on various datasets, including image datasets and large-scale networks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a fresh perspective on graph-based SSL by framing it as a continuous nonconvex quadratic programming problem.
- The theoretical formulation is robust, and the use of ADMM is well-justified, providing solid convergence guarantees.
- The approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets, highlighting its practical relevance.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation and contribution of the paper are unclear, particularly the relationship between the proposed method and its technical design.
- Limited theoretical evidence supports claims regarding the effectiveness of the cardinality-constrained graph partitioning approach in low label rate and class imbalance scenarios.
- The choice of the hyperparameter \( s \) is inadequately justified, and its selection process remains ambiguous.
- The connection to mean-shifted Laplace learning lacks clarity, and the experimental validation could benefit from comparisons with a broader range of baseline methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation and contributions, explicitly linking them to the technical design of CutSSL. Additionally, providing more theoretical analysis on the effectiveness of the proposed method in low label rate and class imbalance scenarios would strengthen the paper. We suggest that the authors clarify the selection process for the hyperparameter \( s \) and ensure that its role is adequately justified. Furthermore, a more extensive experimental comparison with recent graph-based SSL algorithms, particularly GNN-based methods, would enhance the empirical validation of CutSSL. Lastly, a detailed analysis of the method's sensitivity to hyperparameters and its performance across different graph construction methods should be included.
