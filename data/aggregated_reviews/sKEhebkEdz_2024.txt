Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a semi-supervised knowledge transfer framework called DANCE, aimed at transferring cell type annotations from scRNA-seq data to unannotated scATAC-seq data under label scarcity. The authors propose a shared encoder, optimal transport for dataset expansion, a divide-and-conquer strategy, and cross-omic multi-sample Mixup to address the challenges of heterogeneous multi-omic data. Extensive experiments demonstrate DANCE's superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method is innovative and technically sound, outperforming existing methods on integration datasets.
2. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component in the methodology.
3. The paper is well-structured, clearly written, and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
1. The prevalence of the problem setting, where only a small subset of scRNA-seq data is annotated, lacks strong evidence; practical examples would enhance credibility.
2. The uniform distribution assumption in the optimal transport process may not hold due to imbalances in scRNA-seq data.
3. The methodology comparison lacks newer methods, and the use of symbols in equations may cause confusion.
4. The experimental results are based on subsets rather than full datasets, which may weaken the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evidence supporting the claim regarding the practical prevalence of partial annotations in scRNA-seq data by providing real-world examples. Additionally, including experimental results on full datasets would strengthen the findings. Clarifying the uniform distribution assumption in the optimal transport process and providing a more comprehensive description of the empirical hyperparameters would enhance the methodology's transparency. Finally, we suggest comparing DANCE with newer methods and addressing the potential confusion caused by repeated symbols in equations.
