Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new method, STDE, for computing high-order differential operators of neural network-represented functions, leveraging a generalization of Taylor-mode automatic differentiation (AD) and randomness. The authors demonstrate STDE's impressive performance in terms of speed and memory efficiency, particularly in applications involving physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The method allows for significant computational improvements, enabling the solution of high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) efficiently.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work addresses a significant challenge in physics-informed machine learning.
- Clear and comprehensive analysis of previous AD algorithms alongside STDE.
- STDE shows potential for improved computation of differential operators in terms of memory and efficiency.
- The introduction of randomness beyond traditional methods offers new insights.

Weaknesses:
1. STDE, being a random algorithm, does not provide precise derivatives, which may lead to unreliable solutions in precision-demanding tasks. A cost-accuracy curve should be included to enhance credibility.
2. The experiments primarily focus on Laplacians, lacking comparisons with other high-order operators and direct back-propagation. Broader applications beyond PINNs are needed to demonstrate the method's impact.
3. Several relevant works are not cited, including those discussing the forward rule for differential operators and geometric interpretations of Taylor-mode AD.
4. STDE's applicability to arbitrary high-order operators is limited, which constrains its potential use cases.
5. The authors do not clarify the implications of large $l$ for high $k$, which is necessary for assessing STDE's effectiveness.
6. Some terminological inaccuracies and confusing writing detract from clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the precision of STDE by including a cost-accuracy curve to validate its performance in precision-critical applications. Additionally, the authors should expand their experimental scope to include comparisons with modified forward-Laplacian methods and direct back-propagation, as well as target a wider range of applications beyond PINNs. It is crucial to cite relevant literature that discusses the forward rule and geometric interpretations of Taylor-mode AD to clarify the novelty of their contributions. The authors should also address the limitations of STDE regarding arbitrary high-order operators and provide clarity on the implications of large $l$ for high $k$. Finally, we suggest revising the manuscript to correct terminological inaccuracies and improve overall clarity in writing.
