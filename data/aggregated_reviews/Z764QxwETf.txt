Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to solving spatial puzzles, specifically Cross-cut Jigsaw Puzzles (CJP), Voronoi Jigsaw Puzzles (VJP), and room layout arrangements, using a conditional diffusion model. The authors demonstrate that their method aligns all pieces in one pass, contrasting with previous methods that rely on pairwise alignment, which struggle with increased complexity. The proposed method shows superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, indicating its robustness against noisy data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The writing is clear and easy to follow.
- The method effectively showcases the potential of generative models in spatial puzzle solving, potentially inspiring solutions for more complex puzzles.
- The robustness of the proposed methods is validated through experiments with noisy spatial puzzles.
- The introduction of two new datasets enhances the applicability of the model.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for the application and methodology lacks clarity; the need for assembling multiple floorplan regions is not well justified.
- The complexity of the tasks presented (CJP and VJP) appears limited, raising questions about the necessity of a learning-based approach.
- The canonical diffusion model's requirement for numerous denoising steps is not addressed, impacting time efficiency.
- The evaluation metrics are not interpretable, and there are discrepancies in the presentation of results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for their applications, particularly regarding the assembly of multiple floorplan regions, to clarify its necessity. Additionally, we suggest providing more complex examples in the paper to demonstrate the method's capability in handling intricate cases. Enhancing the clarity of the evaluation metrics and addressing the discrepancies between figures and supplementary materials would also strengthen the paper. Finally, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the implications of their results and discuss the quality of outcomes more thoroughly.
