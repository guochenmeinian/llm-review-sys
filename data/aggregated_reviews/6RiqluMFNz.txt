Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of Lipschitz bandits under adversarial corruptions, considering both weak and strong adversaries. The authors propose Robust Zooming for strong adversaries with a known corruption budget and RMEL for weak adversaries, along with a two-layer framework BoB for strong adversaries with unknown budgets. The paper establishes both upper and lower bounds for cumulative regret, demonstrating that Robust Zooming is theoretically optimal for strong adversaries. The authors also introduce a series of algorithms, including Zooming, RMEL, and BoB Robust Zooming, evaluated across various budgets and scenarios. Detailed tables summarize the performance metrics, including regret values and mean functions, confirming the algorithms' effectiveness compared to classical methods. Experimental results validate the practical performance of RMEL and BoB, particularly in the context of the system model outlined in Section 3.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- This is the first work to address robust Lipschitz bandits.
- The study encompasses various adversary types and corruption budget scenarios.
- The paper provides both algorithmic upper and lower bounds.
- The authors conducted additional experiments that validate the performance claims of their algorithms.
- The detailed tables provide clear and comprehensive data supporting the findings.
- The authors addressed reviewer comments effectively, enhancing the paper's quality.

Weaknesses:
- There exists a gap between the upper and lower bounds for both weak and strong adversaries when the budget is unknown.
- In experiments, while RMEL and BoB outperform baselines, their cumulative regrets do not converge in several settings.
- The assumption that \(c_t(x)\) is bounded by 1 is questioned, as it is not straightforward to ignore cases where \(c_t(x) > 1\).
- Some proposed algorithms rely heavily on existing techniques, which diminishes the novelty of the work.
- Some conclusions drawn from the mathematical proofs could be clearer, particularly regarding the relationship between \(d_z\) and \(d_z'\).
- A few reviewers expressed concerns about the technical novelty and contributions of the work, indicating room for improvement in these areas.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the assumptions in Section 3, particularly regarding the boundedness of \(c_t(x)\). Additionally, we suggest that the authors address the gap between upper and lower bounds for unknown budgets more thoroughly. It would be beneficial to clarify the definitions of covering and zooming dimensions, ensuring consistency with prior works. We encourage the authors to consider incorporating explicit corruption functions that adhere to the proposed adversarial model in their simulations, as this would enhance the evaluation of their algorithms. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their mathematical proofs, particularly the conclusion regarding \(d_z\) and \(d_z'\), by presenting a more straightforward derivation. Finally, we encourage the authors to further emphasize the technical novelty and contributions of their work to address reviewer concerns effectively.
