Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework called Proactive Infeasibility Prevention (PIP) aimed at enhancing neural methods for complex Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) with interdependent constraints, specifically the Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Window (TSPTW) and TSP with Draft Limit (TSPDL). The authors propose integrating the Lagrangian multiplier method and preventative infeasibility masking into the solution construction process to improve solution feasibility and optimality. An enhanced version, PIP-D, utilizes an auxiliary decoder to predict infeasibility masks, potentially lowering computational costs during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate PIP's effectiveness in reducing infeasible rates and improving solution quality. Additionally, the paper includes a comparative analysis of various methods, including LKH3 and POMO*+PIP, under different hardness levels and inference time constraints, highlighting significant differences in total inference time and objective values, particularly for POMO*+PIP-D. The authors address previous reviewer comments and incorporate additional results to strengthen their conclusions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The PIP framework offers an innovative approach to integrating constraint awareness and preventative measures in neural VRP solvers.
- The use of an auxiliary decoder for predicting infeasibility masks is a commendable effort.
- The paper provides extensive empirical validation, clearly presenting the problem, proposed solutions, and experimental results, supported by effective figures and tables.
- The authors provide comprehensive results across multiple configurations, demonstrating the effectiveness of their proposed methods.
- The response to reviewer feedback is thorough, indicating a willingness to improve the manuscript based on constructive criticism.

Weaknesses:
- The concepts of the Lagrangian multiplier and preventive mask functions are not novel.
- The absence of provided code limits reproducibility.
- The method for obtaining training labels for infeasibility masks is unclear, and the computation may be expensive.
- The paper lacks discussions on recent related work in AI and Operations Research.
- Additional experiments on a broader range of VRP variants and real-world datasets are needed for better generalizability.
- The presentation could improve by contextualizing this work within the current state-of-the-art in neural VRP solvers.
- A thorough analysis of the computational efficiency of the PIP-D framework, particularly regarding scalability, is necessary.
- The theoretical foundations of the proposed methods and their implications for combinatorial optimization require deeper exploration.
- Some reviewers express concerns about the theoretical analysis of PIP and its application, suggesting it remains an area for future work.
- There is a need for clearer distinctions in the conclusions regarding the proposed approach versus LKH.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how to obtain training labels for infeasibility masks and address the computational costs associated with this process. Additionally, the authors should include comparisons between different step numbers in PIP, such as zero-step and two-step PIP, to evaluate the impact of the "looking ahead" masking strategy. Expanding the experimental scope to include various VRP variants and real-world datasets would enhance the validation of the proposed methods. Furthermore, a more comprehensive discussion on the theoretical justifications for PIP and its scalability to larger datasets is essential. We also suggest providing comparisons with classical methods like LKH3 under consistent time limits to ensure fair evaluations. Lastly, improving the clarity of the conclusions by explicitly contrasting their proposed approach with LKH would strengthen the manuscript.
