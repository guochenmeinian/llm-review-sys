Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents several extensions to functional diffusion models, specifically focusing on geometric inputs such as manifold values and symmetries. The authors propose a generative model over vector fields that integrates ideas from neural diffusion processes and equivariant learning. The model is defined via an Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck process and is trained using a denoising score matching loss. Additionally, the authors introduce a conditional sampling method that generalizes existing approaches. The proposed GeomNDP model incorporates symmetries and is evaluated through experiments on both synthetic and real data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed methodology effectively extends functional diffusion models, particularly for geometric data relevant to Earth science.
- The paper is well-written and presents clear experimental results demonstrating the model's competitive performance and efficiency in training.
- The conditional sampling method shows strong empirical performance and addresses limitations of previous methods.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments primarily involve small-dimensional data, raising questions about the model's scalability to higher dimensions.
- Some experimental results, particularly in Table 1, suggest that the alternative diffusion formulation does not significantly outperform previous formulations on standard datasets.
- The exposition of the conditional sampler and certain technical aspects, such as the definition of the noising process, lack clarity and require careful reading.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the exposition, particularly in Section 3.3 regarding the conditional sampler, to enhance reader comprehension. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons against recently proposed function-space diffusion models as additional baselines to strengthen the evaluation. To address the scalability concerns, we encourage the authors to conduct experiments on higher-dimensional datasets. Finally, we advise the authors to provide clearer definitions and references for key concepts and results throughout the paper, particularly in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, to aid understanding.
