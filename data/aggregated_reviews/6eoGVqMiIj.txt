Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a dual strategy for real-world image restoration: GenIR and DreamClear. GenIR is a novel data curation pipeline that generates a large-scale dataset of one million high-quality 2K images, addressing dataset limitations. DreamClear is a Diffusion Transformer-based model that utilizes generative priors from text-to-image diffusion models and multi-modal large language models for photorealistic restorations, incorporating the Mixture of Adaptive Modulator (MoAM) to manage various real-world degradations. Extensive experiments validate DreamClear's superior performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The writing and structure of the paper are clear and well-organized, facilitating understanding of the authors' methodologies.
2. The introduction of a privacy-safe dataset curation pipeline is significant, particularly in the context of large models where data privacy is crucial.
3. Experimental results convincingly demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness in real-world image restoration scenarios.

Weaknesses:
1. The quality assessment of the newly constructed dataset is insufficient, lacking both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, raising concerns about its effectiveness for real-world image restoration.
2. The ablation studies do not adequately discuss the interaction between the dual branches, necessitating further explanation of the design choice.
3. The paper does not sufficiently compare its approach with SUPIR using more challenging examples to demonstrate robustness and applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the quality assessment of the dataset by including both quantitative and qualitative evaluations to substantiate its effectiveness. Additionally, a more detailed discussion on the interaction between the dual branches in the ablation studies is necessary to clarify the rationale behind the design. Finally, we suggest that the authors compare their approach with SUPIR using more challenging examples to better illustrate the robustness and applicability of their method.
