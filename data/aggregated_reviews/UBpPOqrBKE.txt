Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel federated framework, FedGCDR, aimed at addressing privacy preservation and negative transfer in Broader-Source Cross-Domain Recommendation (BS-CDR) scenarios. It includes two key modules: the positive knowledge transfer module and the positive knowledge activation module, which utilize differential privacy and feature mapping techniques. The framework is validated through extensive experiments on the Amazon dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Innovation: The dynamic attention mechanism and HVH pipeline enhance the efficiency of multi-domain training while ensuring privacy through differential privacy.
2. Theoretical Analysis: The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation, particularly regarding the Gaussian mechanism's effectiveness in protecting high-order embeddings from inference attacks.
3. Comprehensive Empirical Evaluation: Extensive experiments across sixteen domains validate the model's performance, addressing both soft and hard negative transfer.

Weaknesses:
1. Inconsistencies in terminology, particularly regarding "intra-domain" and "inter-domain" privacy, may obscure the paper's motivation and clarity.
2. The emphasis on "Broader-Domain CDR" involving more than three domains lacks clear justification, potentially leading to misunderstandings.
3. The experimental section does not adequately discuss privacy preservation, despite its significance as a contribution.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the consistency of terminology throughout the paper, particularly in defining intra-domain and inter-domain privacy. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the significance of emphasizing "Broader-Domain CDR" over "multi-domain CDR" to avoid confusion. Finally, we encourage the authors to include a discussion on privacy preservation in the experimental section to highlight this critical aspect of their contribution.
