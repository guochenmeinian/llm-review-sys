### Key Points
This paper presents SummIt, an LLM-based summarization framework that utilizes iterative summary generation rather than a single-pass approach. The authors employ LLM self-evaluation and feedback to enhance output quality, with a separate knowledge extraction model guiding the editing process. SummIt demonstrates superior performance in human evaluations on CNN/DM and XSum datasets, although ChatGPT outperforms it in some factuality metrics. The framework also shows improved controllability in query-focused summarization tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- SummIt is a simple and efficient technique for iterative summarization improvement.
- The paper is well-written and includes thorough experiments across multiple meaningful metrics, not limited to ROUGE scores.
- SummIt exceeds state-of-the-art models in several aspects and shows strong human preference in evaluations.

Weaknesses:
- The knowledge extractor's performance in faithfulness evaluations is mixed.
- SummIt has a lower ROUGE score compared to other models and only compares to zero-shot and few-shot learning models, raising questions about its performance against fine-tuning approaches.
- The experiments are conducted on limited datasets, raising concerns about adaptability to more complex scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the effects of the five refinement operations used in the model, particularly regarding the impact of removing "Keep the summary unchanged." Additionally, we suggest providing explanations for the less common metrics G-Eval, FactCC, and DAE in the appendix to enhance clarity. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore the upper bound performance of SummIt if fine-tuned, as this could provide valuable insights into its capabilities.
