### Key Points
This paper presents a study that trains the RoBERTa model to predict whether individuals discussing anxiety in their posts will subsequently express interest in ADHD, achieving a high performance of 76% correct. The authors propose that this model can provide insights into the comorbidity of anxiety and ADHD. However, the implications of the model's classification capabilities remain unclear, particularly regarding the potential causal relationships versus mere associations between anxiety and ADHD symptoms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a clear understanding of the problem statement and necessary background information regarding the challenges of detecting co-morbid ADHD.
- The data collection and processing methods are sound, particularly the six-month gap in user posting history, which is a reasonable choice.
- The study's quality is good, and it presents a significant comparison of three models, identifying one that significantly outperforms the others.

Weaknesses:
- The implications of the model's classification ability are not clearly stated, and the potential for selection bias is acknowledged but not adequately addressed.
- The proxy task of subreddit posting behavior is a weak link to actual comorbid ADHD, with no method for verifying this connection.
- The practical benefits of the study for future ADHD diagnosis are not discussed, and visualizations mentioned in the text are absent.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the implications of their findings, particularly regarding the causal relationships between anxiety and ADHD. Additionally, the authors should discuss the significance of their work in the context of clinical diagnosis more thoroughly. Clarifying the data collection process, especially regarding the removal of posts from the ADHD subreddit, is essential. We also suggest including the promised visualizations and addressing the absence of referenced figures in the manuscript. Finally, utilizing a Chat-GPT or equivalent LLM to refine the ground truth for the proxy task could enhance data quality.
