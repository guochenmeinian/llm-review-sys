### Key Points
This paper presents LLaRD, a novel framework that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the denoising process in recommender systems, addressing the challenge of noisy implicit feedback data. LLaRD integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and the Information Bottleneck principle to improve recommendation accuracy. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through empirical evaluations on multiple datasets, highlighting its potential to provide more personalized user experiences.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The innovative application of LLMs for denoising in recommendation systems is a significant contribution.
- The manuscript is well-structured and clearly articulated, facilitating reader comprehension.
- Extensive empirical validation supports the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks sufficient evaluation models, particularly regarding its applicability to sequential recommendation tasks, leaving questions about its effectiveness in dynamic contexts.
- There is inadequate analysis of the time complexity and computational efficiency of the proposed method, raising concerns about practical applicability.
- The manuscript does not provide a comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art methods, nor does it include a detailed case study on the denoising aspect.
- Certain hyperparameters are not adequately discussed, and the backbone models used may not represent the current state-of-the-art.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by providing a more detailed comparison with specific state-of-the-art methods to clarify how LLaRD uniquely addresses existing challenges. Additionally, a comprehensive case study on the denoising process should be included. We also suggest that the authors enhance the experimental setup and validation processes to bolster the credibility of their findings. Furthermore, a thorough analysis of the time complexity and computational efficiency of the proposed method is essential. Lastly, discussing the roles and sensitivity of hyperparameters introduced in the framework would aid in understanding their contributions.
