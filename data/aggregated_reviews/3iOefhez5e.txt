### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the hardness of broadcasting on trees for low-degree polynomials. The main result demonstrates that log(N) degree polynomials of the leaf values exhibit vanishing correlation with the root, addressing a significant open question posed by Kohler and Mossel (NeurIPS 2022). The broadcasting problem involves a d-ary depth ℓ tree T, an ergodic Markov chain M over state space [q], and a root distribution ν over [q]. The authors show that for any function f of the leaf states with bounded Efron-Stein degree, the variance of f conditioned on the root state is limited, indicating that low-degree polynomials cannot be correlated with the root as tree depth increases.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a mathematically natural question regarding the correlation between low-degree statistics of the leaves and the root, supported by recent works on low-degree polynomials in statistical-computational gaps.  
- The introduction of fractal capacity and the inductive method for low-degree functions may have independent significance.  
- The authors provide a clear overview of their method in the symmetric linear case, which is helpful for understanding the more complex low-degree case.

Weaknesses:  
- There are numerous typographical and syntax errors that hinder readability.  
- While the results are significant, the paper could benefit from a more thorough exploration of lower bounds against super-logarithmic degree polynomials, as seen in the λ=0 case.  
- The presentation, particularly in the introduction, may be challenging for non-experts, necessitating additional context.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the overall presentation by addressing the numerous typographical and syntax errors to enhance readability. Additionally, we suggest including a related work section focused on low-degree techniques to provide context and balance the content. Clarifying the definitions of concepts such as fractal capacity and ensuring that all terminology is consistent and well-defined will also strengthen the paper. Finally, we encourage the authors to consider expanding their discussion on the implications of their results, particularly regarding the optimality of their findings in the fractal sense.
