Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Poseidon, a new PDE foundation model based on a multiscale vision transformer architecture. The authors propose a data augmentation method leveraging the semi-group property of time-dependent PDEs to enhance training data. Poseidon demonstrates superior accuracy across various fluid dynamics benchmark problems compared to existing models like the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and Multiple Physics Pretraining. The model's performance improves with increased size, aligning with established scaling laws in large language models. Furthermore, a comparative analysis reveals that Poseidon models require significantly fewer fine-tuning trajectories to achieve comparable accuracy, with Poseidon-T needing only 106 trajectories versus FNO's 1024. Fine-tuning times for Poseidon models are also substantially lower, with Poseidon-T taking approximately 1.1 hours on an RTX4090 GPU compared to FNO's 16.6 hours. The authors explore the performance of fine-tuned FNO models on different tasks, showing that Poseidon models outperform FNO in most scenarios, particularly in tasks involving the Wave Equation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of Poseidon as a novel PDE foundation model utilizing a multiscale vision transformer is a significant contribution.
- The incorporation of data augmentation based on the semi-group property effectively scales training data.
- Extensive evaluations across 15 challenging downstream tasks show Poseidon's strong empirical performance and sample efficiency.
- The paper provides a thorough analysis of the computational efficiency of Poseidon models, highlighting their sample efficiency.
- The authors effectively demonstrate the superior performance of Poseidon models across diverse tasks and datasets.
- The response to reviewer feedback shows a commitment to addressing concerns and improving the paper.

Weaknesses:
- The robustness of Poseidon to noisy or incomplete training data is inadequately explored, which is critical for real-world applications.
- The paper lacks a thorough analysis of computational costs and memory usage compared to baseline models.
- Clarity issues exist in the approach section, with many terms and acronyms undefined, making it difficult to follow.
- The model's significantly higher inference time compared to benchmarks is not adequately highlighted in the main text.
- The fine-tuning times were not conducted in a controlled environment, which may affect the reliability of the reported results.
- The focus on Cartesian geometries limits the applicability of the findings, though the authors acknowledge plans to expand into irregular geometries in future work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the approach section by defining key terms and operations, and minimizing references to the appendix for critical information. It would be beneficial to provide an overview of the training dataset and downstream tasks to clarify their relevance. Additionally, the authors should explicitly consider the learning of solution operators that account for varying PDE parameters, not just different initial conditions. We suggest including a comprehensive analysis of computational resources required for fine-tuning compared to baseline models. The authors should also address the model's inference time in the main paper and provide statistical significance for key results. Finally, we recommend that the authors improve the rigor of their fine-tuning time evaluations by conducting tests in a controlled environment to enhance reliability and expedite their plans to include tasks involving irregular geometries to broaden the applicability of their findings. Conducting ablation studies to justify the inclusion of the ConNeXt block and comparing Poseidon with other recent PDE foundation models would further strengthen the paper.
