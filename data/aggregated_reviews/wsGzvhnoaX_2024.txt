Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents quantum algorithms for stochastic optimization, specifically targeting the $(\delta,\epsilon)$-Goldstein stationary point of potentially nonconvex and nonsmooth objective functions. The authors propose a zeroth-order quantum estimator that utilizes quantum variance reduction techniques, leading to the development of two algorithms, QGFM and QGFM+, which achieve quantum speedups on the order of $\epsilon^{-2/3}$. The paper demonstrates improved query complexities compared to classical methods, achieving rates of $\tilde O(d^{3/2}\delta^{-1}\epsilon^{-3})$ and $\tilde O(d^{3/2}\delta^{-1}\epsilon^{-7/3})$ for finding Goldstein stationary points, and discusses the construction of quantum oracles and variance reduction techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper initiates the study of quantum algorithms for finding Goldstein stationary points, a significant problem in continuous optimization.
- It proposes a new zeroth-order quantum estimator, leading to quantum algorithms that show speedup compared to classical counterparts.
- The construction of quantum sampling oracles is explicit, with a detailed discussion on qubit requirements.

Weaknesses:
- The specific speedup from the quantum method is not entirely clear, particularly in Section 3, which is hard to follow.
- The overall technical approach remains straightforward, lacking novelty in the quantum mean value estimation procedure.
- The dimension dependence of the algorithms is suboptimal, with potential improvements suggested by existing literature.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 3 by providing a deeper discussion on the quantum speedup, including whether it is a consequence of the Deutsch-Josza theorem. Additionally, addressing the dimension dependence issue by exploring the substitution of the quantum estimator into the online-to-non-convex (o2nc) framework may yield better results. We also suggest ensuring consistency in the notation used throughout the paper, particularly with big-O notation and the quantum oracle notation. Finally, the authors should clarify the practical feasibility of their quantum oracle implementation and provide a detailed analysis of the actual time complexity in terms of gate counts.
