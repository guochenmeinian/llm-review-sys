Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to the imbalanced node classification problem in graph neural networks (GNNs) by establishing a theoretical connection between model variance and dataset imbalance through Bias-Variance Decomposition. The authors propose a regularization term derived from this theory to approximate model variance, utilizing graph data augmentation techniques. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through extensive experiments across various datasets, showing significant performance improvements over baseline methods. Additionally, the authors provide clarifications in their rebuttal that address some technical concerns raised by reviewers, although the overall contribution is viewed as limited.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The idea is novel with solid theoretical motivation, establishing a relationship between imbalance and variance.
- The proposed method shows strong empirical results and performance improvements, supported by extensive experimental results.
- The paper is clearly written and well-structured, making it accessible.
- The authors effectively clarify their approach in response to reviewer feedback.

Weaknesses:
- The related work section lacks comprehensiveness, and the method shares similarities with existing techniques, such as "confidence-based label-guided consistency regularization" and intra-class aggregation in contrastive learning. A discussion on these similarities would enhance originality.
- The contribution of the paper is perceived as limited.
- Some reviewers express unfamiliarity with the field, impacting their confidence in the evaluation.
- The paper contains numerous typos and notation inconsistencies that may hinder readability.
- Strong assumptions regarding the distribution of embeddings may not hold in practice, particularly in poorly trained models, and this concern is not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section to provide a more comprehensive overview of existing techniques and clarify the distinctions between their method and established approaches. Additionally, addressing the numerous typos and notation issues throughout the manuscript will enhance clarity. It would also be beneficial for the authors to discuss the implications of their strong assumptions regarding embedding distributions and how these might affect the regularization's effectiveness, particularly in early training stages. Furthermore, we suggest conducting more ablation studies to demonstrate the relationship between the theoretical results and the performance of the proposed method. Finally, enhancing the discussion around the benchmarks used in node classification may help address reviewers' concerns regarding familiarity with the field and improve the perceived contribution of their work.
