Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework that utilizes GPT-4V to assign material information to 3D objects with a known base color, leveraging a pre-established material library. The authors propose an automated recognition and indexing system, employing Semantic-SAM for segmentation and hierarchical prompting for material retrieval. The pipeline aims to generate SVBRDF maps, enhancing the photorealism of 3D models under dynamic lighting conditions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The system's reliance on retrieval rather than generation from a generative model enhances controllability and interpretability.
2. The results demonstrate decent quality, particularly for metallic or specular materials, and the paper is well-written, facilitating reproduction.
3. The hierarchical prompting technique proposed for material retrieval improves query efficiency.

Weaknesses:
1. The requirement for a base color limits the applicability of the method, as generating a base color remains a significant challenge in 3D generation.
2. The assumption that parts with the same base color share the same material is overly simplistic and restricts the method's effectiveness.
3. The technical contributions are minimal, primarily leveraging GPT-4V, and the implementation details are insufficiently detailed in the main text, particularly regarding material retrieval.
4. The evaluation lacks robustness, as it is difficult to assess material assignment quality, and the results do not show significant differences compared to albedo-only baselines.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their method by addressing the limitations associated with the requirement for a base color. Additionally, the authors should clarify the assumptions made regarding material properties and provide a more nuanced approach to material classification beyond color similarity. We suggest including key implementation details in the main text to enhance clarity, particularly regarding the retrieval process. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to strengthen their evaluation metrics and consider alternative methods for assessing material quality that do not rely solely on user preference for enhanced lighting effects. Lastly, a discussion on the performance of the method with low-quality input albedo maps would be beneficial.
