Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies the robustness of threshold algorithms in the classic prophet inequality problem, incorporating strategic manipulations by players who signal their rewards. The authors characterize optimal signaling schemes for players and demonstrate that the threshold \( T_\mathsf{KW} \) achieves a \( (1 - 1/e)/2 \)-approximation, which is tight. They also show that for i.i.d. distributions, no threshold \( T \in (N - \alpha_1, N + \alpha_2] \) can guarantee at least a \( 1/2 \) competitive ratio in non-strategic settings when \( \alpha_1 \in (0, 1) \) and \( \alpha_2 \) is large, establishing that the only threshold achieving a competitive ratio of at least \( 1/2 \) must satisfy \( T \le N - \alpha_1 \). The work effectively transforms the decision-making problem into a game, highlighting the interaction between strategic players and the searcher, while also discussing the limitations of existing thresholds for achieving a \( (1-1/e) \) competitive ratio.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of incentives into online decision-making is well-motivated and relevant to real-world scenarios.
- The paper is well-structured, balancing technical proofs with intuitive explanations.
- The results are significant, providing insights into the performance of threshold policies in strategic settings.
- The paper provides a comprehensive proof of Proposition 5.2, demonstrating the limitations of threshold policies in IID cases.
- The authors effectively engage with reviewer feedback, indicating a willingness to refine their work and clarify their findings.

Weaknesses:
- Major questions remain unanswered, such as the implications of requiring a \( \beta < 1/2 \) approximation and exploring the Pareto frontier of \( (\alpha, \beta) \).
- The optimal revealing strategy is only characterized under threshold policies, limiting the generality of the findings.
- The assumption that the searcher maintains a competitive ratio of \( 1/2 \) in the IID case is questionable, as the optimal ratio is \( 1 - 1/e \).
- The analysis does not explore the optimality of the proposed threshold policy compared to dynamic policies, which could enhance the paper's contributions.
- The authors acknowledge that their current work does not address the potential for other thresholds to achieve a \( (1-1/e) \) competitive ratio, leaving a gap in the analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the model's assumptions, particularly regarding the searcher's commitment power and the implications of the signaling schemes. Additionally, the authors should explore the possibility of achieving a \( 1 - 1/e \) competitive ratio in the IID case, as this would enhance the robustness of their results. Clarifying the definition of threshold policies in relation to the signals observed by the searcher would also strengthen the paper. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors improve the discussion on the optimality of their threshold policy in comparison to best dynamic policies, as this could provide valuable insights into the robustness of their approach. Finally, including a more explicit statement of the limitations of their work, particularly regarding the IID case, would enhance clarity for readers.
