### Key Points
This paper presents "SEGAUGMENT," a data augmentation method for speech-to-text translation (S2TT) that generates multiple sentence-level versions from document-level datasets. The authors propose a three-step process: segmentation of document-level speech using the "SHAS" algorithm, CTC-based force alignment with transcripts, and translation of aligned transcripts. The method is evaluated on diverse datasets, including MuST-C, mTEDx, and CoVoST-2, demonstrating strong improvements over competitive baselines, particularly in low-resource settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized, clearly written, and easy to follow.
- It shows significant improvements over baselines and includes thorough experimental design across various datasets and architectures.
- The evaluation of "SEGAUGMENT" on both manually-segmented and automatically-segmented speech highlights its robustness.

Weaknesses:
- The procedures of "SEGAUGMENT" closely resemble those of "Lam et al. 2022," which may undermine its novelty.
- The method's reliance on machine translation (MT) models trained on limited data can affect translation quality and alignment effectiveness.
- Comparisons with other methods are insufficient, as the baselines used are not strong, and the parameter sizes of the models compared are imbalanced.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison by including stronger baselines and addressing the limitations of the MT model used. Additionally, consider exploring or combining other data augmentation methods, such as SpecAugment or speed perturb. We also suggest adding more details in the relevant research section and discussing potential future work to enhance the paper's depth. Lastly, it may be beneficial to clarify the meaning behind symbols in flow diagrams, such as in Figure 3.
