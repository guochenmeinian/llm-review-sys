Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DiffGS, a novel diffusion-based generative model for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that reconstructs 3DGS using structured triplanes representing Gaussian probabilities, colors, and transformations. The authors propose a VAE to encode 3DGS into latent vectors, enabling the training of a diffusion model on these vectors. DiffGS enhances flexibility, efficiency, and diversity in 3D Gaussian representation and generation, significantly improving upon previous methods like TriplaneMeetsGaussian and LGM. The method demonstrates improved performance on various tasks, including unconditional and conditional generation from text and images, and uniquely addresses Gaussian completion and Point-to-Gaussian generation. DiffGS shows good performance across multiple tasks, including text and image conditional generation, and achieves superior generation efficiency and diversity compared to reconstruction-based methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
2. The idea of representing 3DGS with disentangled functions is novel and practical, addressing the challenges of diffusing unstructured data.
3. DiffGS demonstrates significant improvements in Gaussian quality, generation efficiency, and diversity.
4. The ability to generate arbitrary numbers of Gaussians enhances rendering quality.
5. Extensive experiments show that DiffGS outperforms existing methods in terms of speed and generation quality.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation for using a VAE to predict Gaussian splatting over simpler methods is unclear, despite experimental validation.
2. The generated 3DGS may exhibit holes and incomplete shapes, suggesting limitations in the Gaussian extraction algorithm.
3. The continuity of Gaussian properties such as colors and rotations remains a challenge, with reliance on spatial interpolation methods.
4. Some results, particularly those from EG3D, appear to be less favorable than originally reported.
5. The inference efficiency and the impact of optimization on inference speed are not adequately addressed.
6. Important baselines, such as Splatter Image, are missing from the comparisons.
7. The evaluation metrics and protocols used may not align with those of significant prior works, raising concerns about the robustness of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind using a VAE for Gaussian splatting prediction. Additionally, addressing the inference efficiency and providing details on the optimization process during inference would strengthen the paper. We encourage the authors to elaborate on how continuous versions of Gaussian properties (colors, rotations, etc.) are constructed from context, particularly the use of spatial interpolation with spatial kernels like RBFs. Addressing the performance discrepancies observed in EG3D results in the revised manuscript would also enhance the paper's credibility. Including comparisons with missing baselines, such as Splatter Image, and ensuring alignment with evaluation protocols from significant prior works would enhance the robustness of the findings. Finally, we suggest conducting experiments on larger datasets, such as Objaverse, to further validate the scalability and practical applications of DiffGS.
