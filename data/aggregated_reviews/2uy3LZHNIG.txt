Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SMART, a novel motion generation framework that utilizes a decoder-only Transformer architecture for multi-agent traffic simulation. The authors propose a method that combines road and proxy trajectory labeling schemes, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Sim Agents Challenge (WOSAC) leaderboard. The model demonstrates zero-sample generalization ability and effective scalability across datasets, with a single frame inference time under 15 milliseconds, meeting real-time requirements for autonomous driving applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- SMART introduces an innovative approach for generating autonomous driving actions, effectively modeling real driving behavior through a unified token design for motion and map.
- The framework ranks first on the WOSAC leaderboard, showcasing solid performance and efficient inference speed.
- Comprehensive analysis on scalability and zero-shot transferability provides valuable insights into the model's generalization capabilities.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the proposed method is limited due to the established scale law ability of transformer-based models.
- Results in "Table 4" indicate that certain components ("RVT", "NAT", and "NRVT") are detrimental to models trained on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD).
- The paper lacks detailed comparisons with existing methods like Trajeglish and MotionLM, as well as evaluations on the road-vector NTP task.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the differences and advancements of SMART compared to previous works, particularly in relation to Trajeglish and MotionLM. Additionally, providing results on NuPlan and comparisons with the latest works would strengthen the paper. Clarifying the definition and learning process for road-vector NTP, as well as the inference process for SMART, including any sampling techniques employed, would enhance the methodology section. Finally, we suggest a thorough review of notations and writing for clarity, particularly addressing the suspected unintended sentence found in line 508.
