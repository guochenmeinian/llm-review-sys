### Key Points
This paper presents a novel contribution to Arabic Dialect Identification by manually annotating a large corpus to define the Arabic Level of Dialectness (ALDi) Score, quantifying dialectness on a continuum. The authors argue that traditional binary approaches overlook the nuanced spectrum of dialect usage. They introduce the AOC-ALDi dataset, derived from the Arabic Online Commentary, where each sentence is labeled with its ALDi level, showcasing its potential for sociolinguistic analyses.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of the ALDi concept offers a continuous measure of dialect usage, enhancing the understanding of dialect variations.
- The extensive effort in creating the AOC-ALDi dataset provides a robust foundation for evaluating dialectness.
- The paper is well-written and presents clear case studies demonstrating the utility of ALDi.

Weaknesses:
- The agreement among annotators is only moderate, raising concerns about the reliability of the annotations.
- The proposed dataset presents only a marginal contribution over existing resources, and the task of measuring dialectalness may conflate formality with dialect usage.
- The paper lacks sufficient details on replicability and guidelines for applying the ALDi framework to other languages.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Table 5 by specifying whether the ALDi scores are from three annotators. Additionally, please clarify if every sentence was labeled thrice and whether the ALDi predicted label is always in the set of {0, 1/3, 2/3, 1} or can take values between 0 and 1. When evaluating, specify if RMSE is computed against the average or the closest value from multiple annotators. We also suggest addressing the broken image links in Figure A1 and considering the use of morphological analysis tools from Camel Lab for further refinement. Lastly, please clarify the distinction between dialectalness and formality, particularly in Table 1, to enhance the conceptual clarity of your work.
