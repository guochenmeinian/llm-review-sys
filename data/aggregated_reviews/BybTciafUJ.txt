### Key Points
This paper presents Shape Arithmetic Expressions (SHAREs), which integrate the flexibility of Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) with the capability to capture complex feature interactions typical in mathematical expressions. The authors propose SHAREs to overcome the limitations of Symbolic Regression (SR), which struggles with non-closed-form expressions, and GAMs, which fail to model intricate interactions. The paper outlines rules for constructing transparent SHAREs and includes a comparative analysis against SR and GAM, demonstrating improved performance across various settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The introduction of SHAREs offers a novel approach that enhances interpretability and flexibility in modeling.  
- The paper effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods (SR and GAM) and provides a clear framework for constructing SHAREs.  
- The comparative analysis shows improved performance, adding credibility to the proposed method.

Weaknesses:  
- The complexity and scalability of SHAREs require further exploration.  
- Additional comparative analyses are necessary for a more comprehensive evaluation of SHAREs against other modeling approaches.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the exploration of the complexity and scalability of SHAREs. Additionally, we suggest conducting further comparative analyses to provide a more thorough evaluation of SHAREs in relation to other modeling techniques.
