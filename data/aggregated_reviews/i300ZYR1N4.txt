Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive examination of user perception regarding adversarial phishing webpages through two user studies involving 470 participants. The authors propose that adversarial phishing poses significant threats to both users and machine learning-based phishing detection (ML-PWD) systems, revealing that not all perturbation techniques are equally effective. The findings contribute valuable insights into the relationship between user awareness and adversarial phishing, highlighting a critical gap in existing literature.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a novel area of research focused on user awareness of adversarial webpages, which is rarely explored.
- The large-scale approach, with 470 participants, enhances the study's credibility.
- The findings challenge existing assumptions in adversarial machine learning by demonstrating that significant visual perturbations can evade detection.

Weaknesses:
- The practical relevance of adversarial phishing webpages is questionable, as they often differ significantly from typical phishing attempts that replicate legitimate pages.
- The lack of detailed demographic information on participants raises concerns about the diversity and representativeness of the sample.
- Potential bias in the experimental design may have influenced participant responses, as they were aware of the phishing detection focus.
- The selection of specific adversarial webpage types lacks justification, leaving questions about their representativeness.
- The choice of the Random Forest algorithm in the ML model is not adequately explained.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification of the practical application of adversarial phishing webpages, addressing how findings can be effectively utilized in real-world anti-phishing strategies. Additionally, providing detailed demographic information about the participant pool would enhance the representativeness of the findings. 

To mitigate potential bias, we suggest employing a two-stage experimental design where participants first engage with the study without prior knowledge of its phishing focus. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the rationale behind the selection of specific adversarial webpage types and how they relate to real-world phishing scenarios. 

Lastly, we recommend a more explicit justification for the choice of the Random Forest algorithm in the methodology section and a comprehensive description of the perturbation mechanisms used in the study to enhance methodological transparency and generalizability of the findings.
