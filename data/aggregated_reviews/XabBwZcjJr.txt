### Key Points
This paper presents the integration of Bayesian experimental design with deep neural networks and normalizing flows to optimize measurements for quantum technology platforms, specifically focusing on arrays of coupled cavities and qubit arrays. The authors emphasize the significance of active learning in efficiently determining quantum system parameters, particularly in the presence of measurement noise.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel approach that combines Bayesian experimental design with machine learning, providing fresh insights into quantum characterization.
- It addresses the challenges of characterizing quantum devices and highlights the importance of active learning and Bayesian techniques.
- The authors acknowledge measurement noise in quantum systems and propose strategies to mitigate its impact, a topic often overlooked in similar studies.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental section lacks clarity and would benefit from a more detailed presentation of the setup, datasets, and specific results, particularly for readers less familiar with quantum many-body physics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by expanding it with detailed data, metrics, and visual representations to illustrate results more effectively. Additionally, incorporating visualizations to clarify the quantum systems and their characterizations would be beneficial. Further exploration and detailed explanations of the methods and techniques used could enhance understanding. The paper mentions challenges in evaluating expected information gain and nested Monte Carlo estimates; providing practical solutions or alternatives to these challenges would be advantageous. Lastly, specifying the availability of datasets, code, or implementation details would aid in assessing the reproducibility of the results.
