Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DMNet, a Difference Matrix-based Neural Network for subject-independent seizure detection using intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG). The authors propose a self-comparison mechanism to address the domain shift in iEEG signals across different subjects, allowing the model to learn universal seizure patterns. DMNet utilizes contextual and channel-level references to effectively capture changes in seizure activity and demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models across multiple datasets. Additionally, the authors provide a detailed methodology for global hyper-parameter selection in deep learning models applied to clinical datasets, proposing a systematic approach to divide subjects into training and validation groups while ensuring that the test data remains unseen during hyper-parameter selection. They acknowledge the potential risk of domain information leakage but argue that the benefits of global hyper-parameter selection enhance model scalability and facilitate deployment in clinical scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. DMNet effectively addresses the critical challenge of domain shift in iEEG signals, enhancing the model's generalization capabilities.
2. The self-comparison mechanism allows for the learning of subject-independent representations of seizure patterns.
3. The paper is well-structured and presents clear methodology, supported by helpful figures.
4. The methodology for hyper-parameter selection is clearly articulated, allowing for reproducibility.
5. The authors effectively address concerns regarding information leakage and model generalization.
6. The systematic approach to cross-dataset experiments demonstrates thoroughness in experimental design.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks extensive experimental validation across diverse datasets, limiting the demonstrated generalizability of DMNet.
2. The theoretical foundations of DMNet are not thoroughly explained, which could enhance the rigor of the research.
3. The model's architecture, characterized by a limited number of parameters, may hinder its adaptability in diverse scenarios.
4. The original manuscript lacked explicit mention of the chronological split between validation and test sets.
5. There was insufficient detail on whether all baselines followed the same hyper-parameter selection methodology.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the data division and hyper-parameter selection process, ensuring that hyper-parameters are chosen based on validation sets in each fold rather than globally. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed explanation of the theoretical underpinnings of DMNet, including assumptions and proofs. To strengthen validation, conducting experiments on larger and more varied iEEG datasets would be beneficial. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors explicitly state the chronological split between validation and test sets in the revised manuscript. It would also be beneficial to include a detailed description confirming that the same hyper-parameter selection process was applied consistently across all baselines, ensuring transparency and facilitating proper replication of experiments. Finally, consider exploring alternative architectures, such as Transformers, to process differences more effectively.
