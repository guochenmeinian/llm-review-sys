Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new algorithm for multi-armed bandit problems, utilizing the FTRL framework and the flexible $\beta$-Tsallis entropy family of regularizers, where $\beta \in [0,1]$. The authors propose a novel learning rate schedule that provides best-of-both-worlds guarantees across various regularization parameters, removes the uniqueness assumption of the optimal arm, and enhances stochastic bounds for Shannon entropy and Log-barrier regularization. The work extends prior analyses by Ito (2021) and addresses unresolved questions regarding BOBW guarantees without the unique optimal arm assumption.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of new learning rates for $\beta$-Tsallis entropy offers a best-of-both-worlds guarantee.
- The generalization of regret analysis by removing the uniqueness assumption is a significant contribution.
- The paper is well-organized and clearly written, advancing the theory of BOBW algorithms.

Weaknesses:
- The results for the plain multi-armed bandit lack significance, as no improvement in regret bounds is demonstrated compared to existing algorithms.
- The bounds in intermediate regimes appear suboptimal, failing to interpolate effectively between stochastic and adversarial optimal bounds.
- Several notations remain undefined, leading to inconsistencies that require clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical evaluation of their algorithms to validate theoretical results against existing BOBW algorithms. Additionally, we suggest addressing the implications of removing the uniqueness assumption on algorithm performance and clarifying which components of the algorithm contribute to resolving the issues raised in previous works. Furthermore, we advise revising the analysis to ensure consistent notation and addressing the concerns regarding the added log-barrier term's impact on the results.
