Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on approximation methods for data influence, identifying a fundamental theoretical drawback in existing Influence Function (IF) approximations due to their bilinear form, which limits their expressive power. The authors propose a novel interpretation of these approximations as a specific form of Laplace approximation (LA) and introduce a new IF approximation method, GEX, which alleviates the issues related to linearity of gradients and singularity of Hessians. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements in various applications, including noisy label detection and dataset pruning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written, with a smooth narrative and attractive conceptual development.  
- The identification of a common drawback in existing IF approximations is novel and insightful, supported by helpful visualizations.  
- Comprehensive evaluations across various use cases show satisfactory empirical performance.  

Weaknesses:  
- The definition of Influence Function (IF) and the terminology used, such as "I_{Hess}", are inaccurately presented.  
- Key sections, particularly the transition to Section 4.1 and the introduction of LA, lack sufficient elaboration.  
- Some important equations, such as Eq. 9 and Eq. 10, are unclear in their implementation and interpretation.  
- The method's effectiveness on larger datasets remains unverified, as most experiments focus on smaller datasets like MNIST and CIFAR10.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definitions and terminology used, particularly regarding the Influence Function and its notation. Additionally, the transition to Section 4.1 should be elaborated to provide a thorough discussion of GEX before addressing the limitations of other methods. An introduction to Laplace approximation is necessary to ground the development of the proposed method. Furthermore, we suggest including more detailed explanations of key equations, particularly Eq. 9 and Eq. 10, to enhance understanding. Finally, we encourage the authors to validate their method on larger datasets, such as ImageNet1K, to strengthen the generalizability of their findings.
