### Key Points
This paper presents a method to rerank an LLM's responses based on time information, classifying responses as always (un)suitable or temporarily (un)suitable. The authors investigate how this time awareness can enhance dialogue systems, introducing relevant notation and metrics, and demonstrating improvements in time-appropriate responses for a Japanese dataset. The study confirms that people prefer responses that are contextually natural at specific times.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposal addresses an interesting research question regarding time-aware dialogue models.
- The introduction of the NUTA category for assessing time-aware responses is valuable for future research.
- The careful notation and mathematical explanations facilitate understanding of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- The results indicate that improvements are primarily seen in weaker models, with no significant benefits for stronger models like GPT-4.
- The experiments rely on proprietary Twitter-sourced data, raising concerns about reproducibility.
- The paper may be too narrow in scope, as the approach could be extended to other contextual information beyond time.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their approach by evaluating how their method performs with various contextual factors beyond time. Additionally, please provide more details on the selection of "experts" and the prompts used for GPT models. It would be beneficial to assess the impact of using time intervals instead of single hours and clarify the relevance of measuring lengths and n-grams to the paper's goals. We also suggest including the actual Japanese data as examples, along with English translations, to enhance accessibility. Lastly, please address the numerous typos and clarify the definitions of terms and abbreviations to improve readability.
