### Key Points
This paper presents an approach termed NODE2BINARY, which aims to represent nodes in networks using binary vectors to reduce storage overhead. The authors propose converting graphs into a hierarchical partition tree and computing embeddings through a combinatorial optimization task. The methodology is novel, and the authors conduct extensive experiments on various datasets, demonstrating promising performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper constructs an intuitive hierarchical structure based on community detection.
2. The authors conduct a variety of experiments across four datasets, effectively showcasing the performance of the NODE2BINARY approach.
3. The method offers substantial memory efficiency by using binary vectors instead of traditional floating-point representations.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation for using binary embeddings is not clearly articulated, and the advantages of hashing over random projection are not discussed.
2. The proposed method achieves optimal performance on node classification tasks only 50% of the time and does not significantly outperform the best baseline.
3. Efficiency claims are not fully substantiated, as performance metrics do not show clear superiority over existing methods.
4. The selected non-binary baselines are outdated, which may weaken the evaluation of the proposed method.
5. The paper lacks necessary ablation analysis experiments to demonstrate the role of different components of the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for using binary embeddings and provide a detailed comparison of memory usage between NODE2BINARY and the baselines. Additionally, the authors should include more recent studies in the related work section and analyze their characteristics to clarify the contribution of this paper. We suggest conducting ablation studies to demonstrate the impact of various components of the method and providing a clearer definition and theoretical proof of the NP-hard problem. Finally, the authors should address the limitations of the transductive nature of NODE2BINARY and discuss its applicability in dynamic graph environments.
