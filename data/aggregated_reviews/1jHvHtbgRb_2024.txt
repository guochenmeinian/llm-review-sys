### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method to enhance the robustness of deep neural networks against distribution shifts by utilizing task-relevant class covariance derived from manifold capacity theory. The authors propose the AnchorBlock, which achieves competitive performance compared to larger architectures designed for robustness. Experimental results indicate that scaling representations along directions of maximal discriminability yields promising classification outcomes under distribution shifts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is interesting and well-grounded in theory, effectively applying manifold capacity theory to identify task-relevant features.
- The writing is clear and well-motivated, with detailed experimental sections demonstrating that ResNet18 + AnchorBlock outperforms larger models like ResNeXt + TENET.
- The approach is adaptable and simple to implement, enhancing robustness without major architectural changes.

Weaknesses:
- The results are reported primarily in terms of mCE against ResNet variants, lacking comparisons with current state-of-the-art performances and assessments on additional datasets.
- The mathematical formulation in Eq. 1 is unclear, particularly regarding the terms $\mathbf{g}$ and $\lambda$, which are not discussed in the text.
- There is a potential computational overhead due to multiple parallel class covariance heads that is not analyzed, and the method's dependence on labeled data for training covariance matrices could limit its applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the mathematical formulation in Eq. 1 by discussing the terms $\mathbf{g}$ and $\lambda$. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with recent state-of-the-art robustness techniques and testing the proposed method on more complex datasets, such as CIFAR100. Incorporating real-world distribution shifts, like adversarial examples, would provide practical insights into the effectiveness of task-relevant covariance for robustness. Finally, an evaluation of the computational efficiency during training and inference would be beneficial.
