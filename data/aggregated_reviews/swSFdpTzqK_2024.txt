### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework that integrates Federated Learning (FL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict stroke severity using EEG data while preserving patient privacy. The authors propose a model that allows multiple medical institutions to collaboratively train a GNN on local EEG data without sharing sensitive information. The framework incorporates explainability through EdgeSHAP and demonstrates competitive predictive accuracy compared to human experts, achieving a Mean Absolute Error of 3.23.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for using Federated Learning to address privacy concerns in collaborative hospital settings is well-articulated.
- The combination of EEG data with GNNs effectively leverages brain network patterns for accurate predictions.
- The inclusion of EdgeSHAP enhances model explainability, crucial for clinical applications.
- The framework is validated on real-world EEG datasets from multiple institutions.

Weaknesses:
- The term 'rewiring' in GATv2 may be a misinterpretation of sparsification, as no rewiring strategy is indicated.
- Some sentences, such as those describing graph transformations, may be confusing or miswritten.
- Equation 1 lacks clarity regarding the term 'com' and introduces unnecessary terms like h_{new} without definition.
- The attribution of Figure 1 is unclear.
- The focus on 'unifying representations' may not adequately reflect the primary purpose of Federated Learning, which is to enable collaborative and privacy-preserving learning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the problem definition and learning objectives, particularly in the introduction, by properly introducing terms like "EEG" and "MQTT protocol." The dataset description should be relocated to the methodology section. Additionally, please ensure that all references are accessible and properly listed.

Clarification is needed on how "stroke severity" is quantified, including whether a standard metric like NIHSS is used. The task of the prediction model should be explicitly defined, including whether it is a classification or regression task.

We suggest that the authors justify their choice of Mean-Squared Error for performance assessment and consider including additional evaluation metrics to provide a more comprehensive view of model performance. Lastly, enhancing the explanation of brain network visualizations and their clinical relevance would improve the paper's readability and impact.
