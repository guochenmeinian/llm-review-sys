Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the problem of prediction with expert advice in the bandit feedback setting, allowing for abstention. The authors propose the Confidence-rated Bandits with Abstention (CBA) algorithm, an adaptation of the exponential weighted scheme, which achieves guarantees in the form of an upper bound on expected cumulative regret. The paper explores applications of CBA in adversarial contextual bandits, providing both upper and lower bounds on cumulative rewards.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The problem addressed is interesting and relevant, particularly the ability to abstain, which is crucial in high-risk decision-making scenarios.  
- The CBA algorithm achieves near-optimal upper regret bounds in adversarial contextual bandits.  
- The paper presents reward bounds that can improve upon existing algorithms and offers insights into constructing basis functions for contextual bandits with abstention.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper is often unclear and difficult to follow, particularly in sections discussing covering classes and the purpose of experiments.  
- Comparisons with existing algorithms, such as EXP4, lack clarity and concrete examples.  
- The upper bound does not include the approximation error of interval bisection, and there is a significant gap between upper and lower bounds in Section 5.  
- The contextualization relative to prior work is inadequate, with insufficient details about the SpecialistExp algorithm.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper, particularly in sections that abruptly introduce complex concepts. A more thorough discussion of the comparisons with existing algorithms, including concrete examples, would enhance understanding. Additionally, the authors should include a detailed discussion of the limitations of their work. It would also be beneficial to clarify the intuition behind applying CBA to adversarial contextual bandits with abstention and to ensure that the upper bound accounts for the approximation error of interval bisection.
