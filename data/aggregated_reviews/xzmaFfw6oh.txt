Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents MoleculeJAE, a pretraining method for molecule joint auto-encoding that integrates 2D molecular topology and 3D molecular geometry. The authors propose a novel approach that leverages SE(3) symmetry and trains the model by fitting the joint distribution of trajectories from the diffusion model's forward process. The model treats 2D structures and 3D geometries as continuous objects perturbed by Gaussian noise, optimizing the task through a reconstruction loss, a contrastive loss, and a surrogate model. Experimental results demonstrate that MoleculeJAE achieves competitive performance on property prediction and dynamics prediction tasks across the PCQM4Mv2, QM9, and MD17 datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work is well-motivated, addressing the joint learning of 2D and 3D molecular representations, which is still developing.
- The model's ability to learn both 2D bond topology and 3D conformation while respecting SE(3) symmetry is a significant contribution.
- The integration of contrastive and generative learning approaches from a trajectory perspective provides a versatile molecular representation applicable to various downstream tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The treatment of 2D graph topology as a continuous object may not be justified; previous works suggest a discrete representation is more appropriate.
- The experimental results show only marginal improvements over existing methods, and comparisons regarding model parameters, training time, and error bars are lacking.
- The motivation for modeling diffusion trajectories is unclear, and the significance of the contrastive loss in the ablation studies appears limited.
- The presentation of the paper, including figures and background information, could be improved for clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for treating 2D graph topology as a continuous object and consider extending the auto-encoding framework to a discrete representation, as this may yield better results. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons of model parameters, overall training time, and error bars to clarify how MoleculeJAE performs relative to existing methods. Further explanation of the motivation behind modeling diffusion trajectories and additional ablation results would enhance understanding. Lastly, we advise refining the presentation of figures and background information to improve clarity and accessibility for readers.
