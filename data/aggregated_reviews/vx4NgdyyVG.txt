Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a dynamic re-weighting method for imbalanced learning, termed Re-weighting with Density Ratio (RDR). The authors define the ratio of the balanced data set distribution to the training set distribution and estimate it using an iterative update method. The effectiveness of this approach is validated through extensive experiments on various large-scale, long-tailed datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in model generalization, particularly under severe imbalance conditions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper identifies a critical issue with distribution differences that can lead to missing feature patterns in general re-weighting methods.
2. The proposed RDR method is novel, utilizing density ratio estimation for dynamic re-weighting.
3. Extensive experiments validate the proposed method's effectiveness, showing it outperforms other methods in addressing overfitting issues for minority classes.
4. The analysis of weight changes during training reveals a strategic focus on minority classes, enhancing generalizability.

Weaknesses:
1. The formula derivation in Sec. 3.3 lacks detail; it is recommended to explain how formula (7) is obtained in the appendix.
2. The introduction may overlook key articles, such as the work by Wang et al., which should be discussed.
3. There is a lack of theoretical analysis for the RDR method; further insights are needed regarding its theoretical boundaries compared to general re-weighting methods.
4. The paper's readability is hindered by unclear terminology and definitions, particularly regarding the distribution parameters.
5. Typos and unclear references in the experimental section detract from the overall presentation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the formula derivation in Sec. 3.3 by including a detailed explanation of how formula (7) is derived in the appendix. Additionally, the authors should address the oversight of key literature in the introduction and provide a more thorough theoretical analysis of the RDR method, particularly its boundaries compared to general re-weighting methods. To enhance readability, we suggest clarifying the definitions of terms such as P and providing a symbol table. Finally, correcting typos and ensuring clear references in the experimental section will improve the overall presentation of the paper.
