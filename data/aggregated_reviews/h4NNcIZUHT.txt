### Key Points
This paper presents DiSTRICT, a dialogue state tracking (DST) system that employs in-context fine-tuning to enhance DST performance. The system retrieves semantically similar dialogue examples from the training corpus for use during training and testing, performing few-shot evaluations. The authors claim improvements over previous zero/few-shot approaches, demonstrating effectiveness on MultiWOZ 2.0 and 2.1 datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The writing and experiments are clear, and the method is straightforward and replicable.
- The proposed system outperforms several recent auto-regressive DST systems without requiring extensive training data or large model parameters.
- The paper includes appropriate comparisons to baselines and thorough experiments, suggesting the utility of the approach in low-resource scenarios.

Weaknesses:
- The method lacks novelty, as in-context learning has been previously explored in other domains.
- Evaluation is limited to the MultiWOZ dataset, which is considered outdated; more recent and challenging benchmarks should be included.
- The formulation has limitations, such as overwhelming input lengths with more examples and the computational inefficiency of predicting one slot value at a time.
- The hypothesis regarding hand-crafted templates is unconvincing, as automated approaches could reduce preparation time for domain/slot descriptions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty aspect by discussing how their approach differs from existing methods in more detail. Additionally, we suggest evaluating the system on more recent DST benchmarks, such as Schema-guided DST, to demonstrate its robustness. The authors should also address the limitations of input length and computational efficiency by considering methods that allow for predicting multiple slot values simultaneously. Furthermore, we encourage a more thorough discussion on the advantages of their system compared to automated approaches for preparing domain/slot descriptions. Lastly, including confidence intervals in the experiments would enhance the reliability of the results and provide a more comprehensive assessment across multiple domains.
