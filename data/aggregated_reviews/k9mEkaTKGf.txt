### Key Points
This paper presents WavePulse, a real-time framework for monitoring and analyzing radio livestreams, specifically applied to political discourse during the 2024 Presidential Elections. The authors describe the deployment of a comprehensive system that captures, transcribes, and analyzes content from 396 radio stations, generating time-stamped, diarized transcripts. The framework's effectiveness is illustrated through three case studies that explore political narratives, content syndication, and candidate favorability trends, demonstrating its potential for large-scale content analytics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The extensive dataset of nearly 500,000 hours of radio content provides a robust foundation for analysis, showcasing the framework's scalability and relevance to political science.
- The integration of large language models (LLMs) for real-time transcription and analysis represents a significant technological advancement, enhancing the framework's capabilities.
- The paper is well-structured, with clear methodologies and results that effectively illustrate the practical utility of WavePulse in real-world scenarios.

Weaknesses:
- There is insufficient discussion regarding the methodological challenges faced in diarization and transcription, particularly concerning speaker identification errors and audio quality.
- The paper lacks a comparative analysis with existing frameworks, which would help contextualize WavePulse's advantages and limitations.
- Potential biases in the dataset and the generalizability of results are not adequately addressed, raising concerns about the representativeness of the selected radio stations.
- The absence of quantitative evaluation metrics limits the ability to assess the framework's performance and effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the methodological challenges associated with diarization and transcription, including how they addressed issues like speaker identification errors and audio quality. Additionally, we suggest providing a comparative analysis with existing tools to better highlight WavePulse's unique contributions. To enhance the robustness of the findings, consider expanding the dataset to include a more diverse range of radio stations and addressing potential biases. Finally, we encourage the authors to include quantitative evaluation metrics for transcription and analysis accuracy to provide clearer benchmarks for future research.
