### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for financial volatility prediction (FVP) that integrates knowledge-enhanced adaptive pre-training (KePt) to incorporate financial metrics into pre-trained language models (PLMs). The authors propose a conditional time series prediction module to effectively combine text and price information. Evaluations on three real-world earnings call datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, albeit with only marginal improvements over existing baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- The proposed KePt dataset enhances PLMs for financial tasks and will be made publicly available.
- Comprehensive analysis, including ablation studies and case studies, supports the claims.

Weaknesses:
- The use of weak baselines, such as BERT-base-uncased, which has existing alternatives like FinBERT and FLANG-BERT that could provide a more robust comparison.
- The dataset time period is limited, covering only one year, and lacks high volatility periods, which may weaken the conclusions.
- Performance improvements over baselines are minimal, raising questions about the significance of the results.
- Some sections lack detail, and there are formatting issues with font sizes in figures and tables.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the baseline comparisons by including stronger alternatives such as FinBERT or FLANG-BERT, as well as non-text baselines like logistic regression or GARCH models to assess the added value of text data. Additionally, extending the dataset to include more diverse time periods, particularly those with high volatility, would strengthen the findings. We suggest clarifying the methodology for isolating financial metrics in the corpus and conducting multiple runs of experiments to report mean and standard deviation. Lastly, addressing the formatting issues and ensuring a balanced literature review that includes relevant financial journals would enhance the overall quality of the paper.
