### Key Points
This paper presents ChaosBench, a novel benchmark aimed at extending the predictability range of data-driven weather and climate emulators to the Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (S2S) timescale. It includes an extensive dataset comprising variables from land, ocean, and cryosphere reanalysis products over the last 45 years, incorporating physics-based constraints for enhanced explainability. The authors rigorously evaluate the benchmark against existing AI forecast models and national weather agency forecasts, addressing a significant gap in data-driven weather forecasting.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Novel S2S benchmark for climate prediction.
- Comprehensive dataset covering a wide range of variables and long time horizons.
- Rigorous evaluation against multiple physical model baselines and AI-based weather forecast models.
- Thoughtful selection of scoring metrics that prevent overfitting and ensure robustness.

Weaknesses:
- Uncertainty regarding support for multi-resolution forecasting approaches.
- Potential issues with temporal resolution of ocean variables, as the method of replicating monthly data for daily use may hinder model learning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity on how the benchmark can adapt to other datasets, such as MERRA-2, and address the temporal resolution concerns regarding ocean variables. Additionally, we suggest that Figures 4 and 5 be aligned on the same y-axis for better comparison, and that a visual aid be added to Figure 3b to clarify changes in power at high-k.
