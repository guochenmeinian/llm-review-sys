### Key Points
This paper presents a method for Deformable Linear Object Instance Segmentation by combining SAM and CLIPSeg through an adapter network. The authors created a dataset of industrial cables using Blender and achieved state-of-the-art results. The architecture includes a prompt encoder network and a mask classification network, demonstrating effective zero-shot generalization capabilities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
* The paper is well-organized and easy to follow.  
* The proposed approach is simple yet effective, combining the strengths of two segmentation models without requiring model retraining.  
* The authors provide a new dataset for the community and justify their architectural choices with experiments.  

Weaknesses:  
* The inference time is noted as a limitation, and a comparison with reference methods would be beneficial.  
* The rationale for the architecture's alignment with the DLO segmentation problem is unclear, and the training process requires more detailed description.  
* The experimental evaluation relies on a blended dataset, raising concerns about potential biases towards artificial cases; results on real datasets would be valuable.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the architecture's relevance to the DLO segmentation problem and provide a more detailed description of the training process. Additionally, we suggest expanding the application of their method beyond DLO to other domains such as cell imagery and medical imagery. Finally, we advise citing and drawing parallels with ideas on LSC, as this could enhance the paper's contributions and acceptance potential.
