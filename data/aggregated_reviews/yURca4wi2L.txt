Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ConVRT, a novel method for video atmospheric turbulence mitigation (ATM) that improves temporal consistency in turbulence-affected videos. The authors propose a neural video representation that decouples spatial and temporal information, utilizing MLP layers to model deformations caused by atmospheric turbulence. The method integrates supervised and self-supervised learning, enhancing the performance of existing ATM techniques on real-world datasets. However, the method appears to be an add-on to existing turbulence restoration methods, requiring further validation of its standalone effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written.
- The MLP-based network effectively maintains temporal consistency in video restoration.
- Qualitative evaluations demonstrate improvements in videos with moving objects.
- The use of KLT tracking for visualizing temporal variability is a valuable contribution.

Weaknesses:
- ConVRT is limited to handling short video clips, making it less effective for longer sequences or significant motions.
- The related work section lacks completeness, missing comparisons with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and relevant prior works.
- Quantitative evaluation results are confusing, with discrepancies between metric scores and visual improvements.
- The computational efficiency of test-time optimization is not adequately discussed.
- Limited visualization of intermediate results and real-world cases reduces the clarity of algorithm effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the completeness of the related work section by including more SOTA methods and relevant prior works, such as those by Li et al. and Mao et al. Additionally, the authors should clarify the quantitative evaluation results, providing visual comparisons for "no base results" to enhance understanding. It would be beneficial to include more intermediate results and real-world case visualizations to demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness. Furthermore, discussions on the computational efficiency of test-time optimization and the handling of larger motions should be included. Finally, we suggest conducting ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the proposed components, especially the loss function's contribution.
