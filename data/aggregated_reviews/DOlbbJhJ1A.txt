### Key Points
This paper presents a position piece that critically analyzes three main criticisms of large language models (LLMs): their perceived limitations in grasping concepts beyond distributional semantics, their lack of functional language competence, and their role in human language acquisition. The authors argue for a nuanced understanding of LLMs and propose a philosophical perspective that justifies attributing mental states to these models based on pragmatic considerations, aiming to shift the focus from ontological debates to practical value.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and thought-provoking, effectively addressing timely issues surrounding LLMs and bridging the gap between NLP and philosophy.
- It presents convincing arguments that challenge simplistic views of LLM capabilities and emphasizes the importance of sophisticated evaluation methods.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clear connections to concrete applications for NLP, focusing more on philosophical perspectives than on actionable insights for practitioners.
- Some arguments, particularly regarding the attribution of mental states to LLMs, require further justification, especially concerning the implications of such attributions and their societal context.
- Sections of the paper, such as those discussing language acquisition and thought, are confusing and may contradict themselves, necessitating clearer articulation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their arguments, particularly in Section 2.3 regarding language acquisition and in Section 2.2.1, where contradictions arise. Additionally, the authors should engage more deeply with the societal implications of attributing mental states to LLMs and provide a clearer justification for why such attributions are beneficial. Finally, we suggest that the authors strengthen the connection between their philosophical insights and practical applications in NLP to enhance the paper's relevance for both researchers and practitioners.
