Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for aggregating visual tokens in text-video retrieval, extending the ToMe method. It aims to address limitations in video processing for video-to-language tasks by proposing an end-to-end video language learning method that utilizes sufficient input video frames. The authors validate their approach through experiments on paragraph-to-video retrieval and long-form VideoQA benchmarks, achieving comparable performance with reduced computational burden.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method addresses significant practical issues in video language tasks.
- It demonstrates good efficiency and performance on long-form video tasks, with clear ablation studies and visualizations supporting its claims.
- The novel aggregation strategy using bipartite matching effectively reduces computational costs.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks original technical contributions and thorough analysis, primarily extending existing work without sufficient differentiation.
- Results on VideoQA are not particularly impressive compared to other methods, raising questions about the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed token aggregation.
- There are inconsistencies in the reported pre-training data and architecture comparisons, which may mislead readers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions by explicitly differentiating their method from ToMe, including a direct performance comparison. Additionally, please provide baseline results in all relevant tables and clarify the inference time, as GFLOPs alone do not adequately represent speed. It is essential to address the confusion regarding the #PT Data by specifying the data type and ensuring accurate reporting. We also suggest including results on MSRVTT for both retrieval and video QA to facilitate a better evaluation of the method. Finally, please clarify how temporal aggregation handles discontinuous frames to ensure the preservation of temporal relationships in fine-grained video datasets.
