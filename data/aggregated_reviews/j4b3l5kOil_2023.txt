Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a large dataset called AndroidInTheWild, designed to enhance mobile device control systems through over 700k episodes and 30k unique prompts across various Android versions and device types. The authors contribute a detailed analysis of the dataset's generalization capabilities and evaluate two baseline models using Behavioural Cloning and LLMs. The paper concludes with a checklist for authors to ensure accurate representation of contributions and scope, while also discussing potential limitations and future work.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
- The dataset is comprehensive, significantly larger than existing datasets, making it a valuable resource for researchers.
- The authors provide two baseline models that serve as useful starting points for evaluating device automation models.
- The paper is well-organized, clearly written, and effectively outlines related work and methodology.

**Weaknesses:**
- The authors do not sufficiently address potential biases in user demographics within the dataset.
- Limitations of the baseline models, particularly regarding their reliance on detected UI elements and OCR/Icon detection, are not adequately discussed.
- The evaluation of generalization capabilities has limitations, including small test splits and incomplete assessments of unseen scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset description by providing more details on user demographics to address potential biases. Additionally, the authors should explicitly mention the limitations of the baseline models, particularly their inability to interact with arbitrary screen locations and reliance on OCR detection. Future versions could benefit from implementing a <x,y> coordinate-based output for enhanced flexibility. We also suggest expanding the evaluation to include larger test splits and a more comprehensive assessment of unseen scenarios. Lastly, including a statement regarding the ethical clearance process within Google Research would strengthen the ethical considerations of the study.
