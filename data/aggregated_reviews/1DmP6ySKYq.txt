Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a text-to-avatar creation pipeline that builds upon dreamfusion and magic3d, addressing geometric ambiguity by replacing vanilla stable diffusion with a landmark-conditioned diffusion model fine-tuned with controlnet. The authors utilize textual inversion for back view generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating diverse 3D human heads while incorporating identity-aware editing.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The generation results are impressive, producing avatars across various domains, including photo-realistic and anime styles.
- The writing is clear and easy to follow, with a high-quality presentation that motivates the problem and delineates contributions effectively.

Weaknesses:
- Generated avatars lack detail and exhibit artifacts, particularly in hair and clothing, with noticeable noise in zoomed-in results.
- The diversity of generated avatars from the same text prompt is unclear, and the method does not address animation capabilities for the avatars.
- Some figures, such as Fig. 2, are confusing and could benefit from clarification.
- The editing performance is inconsistent, particularly for side and back views, and there are concerns about the representativeness of the results shown in the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the detail and quality of generated avatars, particularly in hair and clothing, to address the observed artifacts. Additionally, the authors should explore methods to enhance generation diversity and clarify how the generated avatars can be animated or edited for expressions. We suggest revising Fig. 2 for clarity and providing more comprehensive visualizations of the geometry. Furthermore, including randomly sampled results rather than cherry-picked examples would strengthen the evaluation. Lastly, the authors should justify claims regarding the stability of their training method with quantitative evidence.
