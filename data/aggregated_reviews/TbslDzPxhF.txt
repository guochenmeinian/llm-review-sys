### Key Points
This paper presents the Job-SDF dataset, a comprehensive resource for job skill demand forecasting compiled from 10.35 million public job advertisements in China. The dataset includes monthly skill demand for 2,324 skills across 52 occupations, 521 companies, and 7 regions. The authors employ a range of forecasting models, including statistical, RNN-based, and Transformer-based approaches, while addressing structural breaks in the data. The paper aims to fill a significant gap in existing datasets, facilitating detailed analysis of labor market dynamics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is extensive and innovative, covering a wide range of job advertisements and skill requirements.
- The paper is well-written and clearly presented, with a logical flow of ideas.
- It provides robust benchmarking of various forecasting models, enhancing the understanding of model performance across different granularities.

Weaknesses:
- The authors have not adequately addressed potential biases in the dataset or the limitations of their work, such as the impact of structural breaks and the lack of fairness testing.
- The temporal scope is limited to 2021-2023, which may not capture longer-term trends.
- The dataset's geographic limitation to China may restrict its applicability to other regions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the transparency of the NER extraction process by providing details on the language of job postings, the performance of the NER model, and any inter-rater agreement from manual annotations. Additionally, highlighting the best results in the result tables could enhance clarity. The authors should also consider discussing potential biases in the dataset and how they might affect generalization. Implementing fairness-aware algorithms and including fairness metrics in the evaluation process would be beneficial. Finally, expanding on the ethical considerations and acknowledging the overlap with the COVID-19 period could strengthen the paper.
