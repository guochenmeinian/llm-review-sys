### Key Points
This paper presents an information entropy aware diffusion model for non-autoregressive text generation, proposing a "key info-first" generation strategy that aligns with human language representation. The authors revise the diffusion model's schedule and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on less commonly-used datasets. The findings indicate improvements in generation quality, diversity, and sampling efficiency compared to baseline models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The approach effectively addresses the gap between diffusion models and human text generation processes by prioritizing keywords.  
2. The integration of an information-entropy aware noise schedule enhances the model's performance.  
3. Experimental results using automatic metrics show positive outcomes against selected baselines.

Weaknesses:  
1. The abstract lacks clarity and organization, leading to confusion regarding key disparities and contributions.  
2. Continuous diffusion may not effectively capture discrete semantic information, increasing text generation costs.  
3. The novelty of the proposed schedule is questionable, as it resembles existing methods like diffusionBERT, and the use of self-conditioning is not new.  
4. The experiments are conducted on less popular datasets, lacking comparisons with commonly-used datasets in summarization and dialogue tasks.  
5. The paper does not include human evaluations to substantiate its claims.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and organization of the abstract to better convey the paper's contributions. Additionally, consider exploring discrete diffusion methods to enhance the model's effectiveness and reduce generation costs. It is crucial to provide a more thorough comparison with existing methodologies, particularly those addressing decoding order in diffusion models. We also suggest incorporating additional experiments and analyses from the rebuttal period and including human evaluations to strengthen the claims made in the paper.
