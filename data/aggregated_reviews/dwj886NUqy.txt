### Key Points
This paper presents an unsupervised approach called "GreedyCAS" for the automatic segmentation of conclusions from non-structured scientific abstracts. The method optimizes segmentation boundaries using Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) and treats each abstract as a recurrent cycle of sentences. The authors have evaluated their approach on two datasets, demonstrating promising results and a strong correlation between NMI and other evaluation metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of a novel approach provides a fresh perspective on abstract segmentation.
2. The theoretical foundation utilizing NMI enhances the credibility of the method.
3. Extensive evaluation against baselines supports the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

Weaknesses:
1. The segmentation approach is limited to two parts (premise and conclusion), which may lack the granularity needed for comprehensive analysis.
2. High time and space complexity may hinder practical efficiency due to the large volume of scientific papers.
3. The datasets used for testing are relatively small and may not represent a broad range of scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the method section by providing a more detailed description to enhance reproducibility, particularly regarding the six possible segmentations mentioned. Additionally, exploring the efficiency of segmenting abstracts into two halves before applying the current methods could be beneficial. The authors should also elaborate on the motivation for limiting segmentation to two subsections rather than a more fine-grained approach. Finally, addressing the concerns regarding the small dataset size and discussing the lack of advantage for structured abstracts would strengthen the paper.
