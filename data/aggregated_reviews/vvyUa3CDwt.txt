Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SELFCLEAN, a methodology for addressing data quality issues such as off-topic images, near duplicates, and label errors using self-supervised representation learning and distance-based indicators. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of SELFCLEAN through extensive experiments across 12 image classification datasets, showing its superiority over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in various scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The relevance of data cleaning aligns well with current research needs, and SELFCLEAN has significant potential for enhancing image classification datasets.
- Extensive experimental results across diverse datasets support the claims of the proposed methodology.
- The innovative use of self-supervised learning and distance-based indicators provides a unique approach to data cleaning.

Weaknesses:
- The analysis of data quality types is insufficient, particularly regarding hidden stratification and the impact of near duplicates on model performance.
- Important baselines, such as the AQuA benchmark for label error detection, are missing from comparisons.
- The methodology may not scale well with large datasets, and the dependence on hyperparameters could introduce subjectivity.
- Ethical concerns regarding the CelebA dataset usage need to be addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of data quality issues by discussing hidden stratification and the effects of near duplicates on model performance more thoroughly. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include comparisons with the AQuA benchmark and other relevant methods for a more comprehensive evaluation. To enhance reproducibility, we suggest providing a detailed tutorial or guidebook for reviewers. Furthermore, addressing the ethical implications of using the CelebA dataset is crucial. Lastly, consider discussing potential remediation strategies for identified data quality issues and the implications of hyperparameter tuning on the cleaning process.
