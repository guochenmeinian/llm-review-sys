### Key Points
This paper presents MeLLoC (Mechanism Learning for Lossless Compression), a novel approach that integrates high-order mechanism learning with classical encoding techniques to enhance lossless compression for scientific floating-point data. The authors propose treating data as discrete samples from a physical field described by differential equations, solving an inverse problem to identify compressible coefficients. Experimental results indicate that MeLLoC achieves superior compression ratios and computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1) Innovative Approach: Combines mechanism learning with classical encoding, effectively leveraging differential equations for scientific data compression.  
2) Superior Performance: Outperforms state-of-the-art lossless compression techniques in terms of compression ratios and computational efficiency.  
3) Comprehensive Experiments: Extensive testing on various datasets demonstrates the robustness and efficacy of the proposed method.  
4) Flexibility: Capable of handling diverse types of scientific data, including those with high-order information and noise.  

Weaknesses:  
1) Model Dependency: Performance heavily relies on the accuracy of the differential equation models representing the data.  
2) Complex Calibration: Precision control requires careful calibration, which can be challenging with diverse data characteristics.  
3) Computational Intensity: Despite improved efficiency, the method still demands significant computational resources for large datasets.  
4) Generalization: May not be as effective for datasets that do not conform well to the assumed physical models.  
5) Presentation Issues: The readability is weak, and more detailed explanations and experimental analyses are necessary.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation, particularly in Section 3, by providing a more detailed introduction to the concept of Mechanism Learning and clarifying the formulation of the difference operator $\mathcal{L}$ and the loss function $F$. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the experimental analysis by including comparisons with relevant methods such as [1] and [2], and by providing multiple concrete examples that cover different magnitudes of single-precision floating-point numbers to demonstrate the claimed lossless property. Furthermore, we advise the authors to elaborate on the calibration process for precision control and to address the challenges of applying MeLLoC to other domains, as mentioned in the conclusion.
