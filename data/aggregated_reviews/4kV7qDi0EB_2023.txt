Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Wisconsin Criminal Law Dataset (WCLD), a comprehensive recidivism dataset derived from publicly accessible criminal case records from Wisconsin's circuit courts, encompassing over 1.5 million rows compared to the COMPAS dataset's 7,000 rows. The authors detail the dataset's construction via the Wisconsin Circuit Courts Access (WCCA) API, including derived features such as prior criminal counts and sentence lengths. The paper discusses ethical considerations regarding the recidivism target variable and the quality control measures taken to redact sensitive information. Additionally, the authors propose to include a column on violent recidivism, acknowledging the complexities involved in its classification due to the lack of direct correspondence in existing datasets and the challenges posed by the large number of charge descriptions. They are exploring an online tool for crime classification but have faced delays in obtaining the source code.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The WCLD dataset is a significant contribution to the fairness community, offering a larger and more diverse dataset than COMPAS.  
- The dataset is a valuable resource for the research community and offers significant improvements over existing datasets.  
- The authors provide clear documentation and a comprehensive discussion of ethical implications, including data quality control measures.  
- The authors are responsive to reviewer feedback, committing to include additional ethical considerations and a column on violent recidivism.  
- The dataset's structure allows for studying data shifts over multiple years, and benchmarks are provided for reference.

Weaknesses:  
- The dataset lacks a detailed schema for column names and data types, which could enhance usability.  
- The follow-up period for recidivism is standard but lacks contextual justification, particularly for serious crimes.  
- The choice of general recidivism as the target variable raises ethical concerns, as it may not accurately reflect recidivism rates without comprehensive data on prison or jail records.  
- The authors have not yet provided the additional column on violent recidivism, which raises concerns about the dataset's completeness.  
- There is a lack of clarity regarding the dataset's access restrictions and compliance with ethical guidelines, particularly concerning the academic-use-only designation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset file by including an additional schema/key for column names, detailing the corresponding features and data types. Additionally, we suggest providing context for the two-year follow-up period for recidivism, particularly regarding its applicability to serious crimes. It may also be beneficial to conduct a descriptive analysis of how crime type and charge severity distributions change with different sentence length cut-offs. Furthermore, we urge the authors to reconsider defining general recidivism as the target variable and explore focusing on violent recidivism or other potential uses of the dataset. We recommend that the authors promptly include the violent recidivism column and provide a clear ethics statement that addresses known biases in recidivism prediction. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the access restrictions for the dataset, specifying whether it will be available through a registration process to ensure compliance with academic-use-only guidelines. Lastly, we encourage the authors to incorporate all suggested ethical discussions and considerations within the current review period to enhance the dataset's robustness.
