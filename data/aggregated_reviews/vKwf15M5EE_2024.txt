Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a deep learning-based method for cortical surface reconstruction (CSR) from brain MRI data, utilizing weak supervision from cortical segmentation maps. The authors propose a weak supervision framework that minimizes reliance on pre-computed pseudo ground truth (pGT) surfaces, particularly beneficial for challenging scenarios like infant data. They introduce several novel loss functions, including uni-directional chamfer loss, inter-mesh normal consistency loss, intensity gradient loss, and mesh quality loss, which address existing challenges in utilizing pGT segmentation maps. The methodology is well-explained, and extensive evaluations on multiple large-scale datasets demonstrate performance comparable to existing supervised methods, establishing a benchmark for weakly supervised CSR tasks and highlighting broad applicability across adult and infant datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The approach significantly reduces dependence on pGT surfaces, marking a departure from traditional methods.  
2. The introduction of innovative loss functions and regularizations enhances flexibility and generalizability in CSR, tackling challenges not previously explored in the literature.  
3. The experimental setup is comprehensive, covering multiple datasets and showcasing adaptability and robustness.  
4. The paper is well-structured, with clear problem descriptions and effective illustrations of results.  
5. The method addresses a critical bottleneck in CSR, potentially broadening its applicability.

Weaknesses:  
1. The technical novelty is limited, with significant similarities to existing works, particularly in architecture and loss functions.  
2. The use of ribbon segmentations as both input and pGT is confusing, as they are claimed to be inaccurate.  
3. The experimental results lack reliability, with concerns about unfair comparisons and inconsistencies in reported metrics.  
4. The paper does not adequately compare with concurrent work published after submission, limiting contextual understanding.  
5. The method's robustness and computational efficiency are not adequately analyzed, and the impact of segmentation quality is not explored.  
6. Some aspects of the methodology may require clearer differentiation from existing approaches to emphasize unique contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their approach by clearly delineating the differences from existing works, particularly [1], [2], and [3]. Clarifying how the proposed boundary surface loss function enhances performance over traditional methods is essential. Additionally, we suggest providing more details on the overlay of predicted meshes on original images and conducting cross-validation on the BCP dataset to ensure fair performance evaluation. A breakdown of runtime comparisons with state-of-the-art methods should be included, along with a discussion on the implications of segmentation quality on reconstruction accuracy. Finally, further exploration of the trade-offs regarding inter-mesh consistency and anatomical fidelity is necessary, and the authors should emphasize the unique contributions of their loss functions and regularization techniques to further highlight the novelty of their approach.
