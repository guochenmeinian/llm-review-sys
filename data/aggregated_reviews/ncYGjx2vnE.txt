Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Chimera, a novel two-dimensional State Space Model (SSM) designed for multivariate time series modeling and forecasting. The model addresses challenges such as nonlinear dynamics, inter-variate dependencies, and efficient training, featuring a unique discretization process and employing a two-dimensional parallel selective scan for rapid training. The authors claim that Chimera achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across various tasks, including forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection, demonstrating improvements over traditional methods like ARIMA and ETS. Comprehensive experiments validate Chimera's effectiveness across multiple datasets, although the evaluation includes a variety of tasks that may not be cohesively integrated.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivations for the research are clearly articulated, and the writing is generally accessible.
- The method demonstrates promising results across multiple time series tasks, with significant improvements over traditional forecasting methods.
- The proposed 2D SSM is innovative, effectively addressing variate relationships, and the authors provide a comprehensive evaluation using multiple datasets and tasks.
- Ablation studies are conducted to support claims regarding the contributions of different components of Chimera.

Weaknesses:
- Several writing issues need clarification, particularly in the introduction of Multi-Dimensional State Space Models and the notation used for variables.
- The soundness of the 2D SSM is questionable, especially regarding the representation of variable relationships and the evaluation metrics for forecasting tasks, which do not adequately reflect model performance at the target horizon.
- The evaluation protocol lacks a thorough investigation into the appropriateness of the datasets used, which may affect the validity of the conclusions, and there are concerns regarding the variability in performance improvements across different tasks.
- The paper attempts to cover too many directions without cohesive integration, potentially diluting its contributions, and it lacks a discussion of limitations and does not provide code implementations for reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing, particularly in Section 2, by elaborating on the 2D grid and avoiding ambiguous notation. Additionally, please clarify the meanings of $N_i$ and $\tau_i$ in Line 93, and unify the terminology used for "variable" and "variate." 

To enhance the soundness of the model, we suggest providing experiments on shuffled variates to address concerns about non-causal transitions and conducting a more robust ablation study to analyze the reasons behind the observed underperformance in certain tasks. A comparison with Koopman-based deep models would also strengthen the discussion of related works. 

For the experiments, we recommend specifying whether classification is performed at the series or point level and incorporating additional evaluation sets using more robust time series forecasting datasets, as exemplified in WITRAN. Including na√Øve forecasting baselines, such as ARIMA and ETS, would strengthen the comparative analysis. Finally, discussing the model's limitations explicitly and including code implementations would significantly improve the paper's contribution to the field.
