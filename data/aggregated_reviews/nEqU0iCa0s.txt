Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Self-Distilled Depth Refinement (SDDR) framework aimed at enhancing depth refinement by inferring high-resolution depth maps from low-resolution estimations. The authors model depth refinement as a noisy Poisson fusion problem, addressing local inconsistency and edge deformation noises. The SDDR framework incorporates depth edge representation and edge-based guidance, utilizing coarse-to-fine self-distillation to generate low-noise depth edge representations that guide the refinement process. The method shows significant improvements in accuracy, edge quality, efficiency, and generalizability across five benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The innovative approach of modeling depth refinement as a noisy Poisson fusion problem effectively addresses common issues in depth refinement.  
2. The self-distillation technique enhances robustness against noise, resulting in high-quality depth maps with accurate edges.  
3. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance across various scenarios.  
4. SDDR achieves higher efficiency compared to two-stage tile-based methods, reducing computational costs while maintaining or improving accuracy and edge quality.  
5. The framework exhibits strong generalizability on both synthetic and real-world datasets.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The paper lacks a discussion on the sensor or modality used for depth estimation.  
2. The authors' categorization of depth prediction errors into local inconsistency noise and edge deformation noise is unclear; accurate sources of error and their significance should be analyzed.  
3. The motivation behind the study is not compellingly justified, and the logic connecting previous works to the current motivation is weak.  
4. The edge-guided gradient loss proposed has been previously used in other works; differences should be clarified.  
5. The paper does not thoroughly explore the method's performance in real-world applications or extreme edge cases.  
6. More detailed ablation studies are needed to understand the contributions of each component within the SDDR framework.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the sensor or modality used for depth estimation. Additionally, the authors should provide a more thorough analysis of the sources of error and their significance. We suggest enhancing the motivation section to offer a stronger justification for the study. Clarifying the differences in the edge-guided gradient loss compared to previous works is also necessary. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore the method's performance in real-world applications and extreme edge cases, and to include more detailed ablation studies to elucidate the contributions of each component in the SDDR framework.
