Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents AbDiffuser, a new equivariant diffusion model aimed at efficiently generating full antibody structures with high quality, specifically targeting HER2. The authors propose several innovations, including Euclidean diffusion with frame averaging for SE(3) equivariance, antibody sequence alignment for standardization, and atom-to-rigid body projections to maintain physical constraints. They introduce APMixer, a neural network for processing proteins, claiming its non-relational architecture offers advantages over existing models. Experimental validation indicates that the generated antibody binders exhibit high affinity, particularly enhancing a cancer drug's effectiveness, with binding results validated through the gold standard SPR assay. However, the evaluation lacks comparisons to state-of-the-art baselines, which limits the assessment of AbDiffuser's performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed approach outperforms baseline methods across various antibody design metrics, suggesting its effectiveness in generating high-quality structures.
- The novel APMixer architecture significantly reduces memory usage during training, enhancing efficiency and scalability.
- The integration of theoretical results with experimental validation adds credibility to the design choices made in the study.
- The use of SPR assay for binding validation provides reliable and reproducible results.

Weaknesses:
- Core components of the model closely resemble existing reference models, raising questions about the novelty of the proposed modifications.
- The claim of generating "full-atom" antibodies is not fully justified by the results presented.
- The novelty of APMixer is questioned, as it relies on existing components with only incremental improvements.
- The presentation is poor, with excessive reliance on the appendix for critical details, making it challenging for readers to grasp the full methodology.
- The experimental setup and metrics are poorly defined, leading to confusion regarding the training dataset and evaluation methods.
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion of limitations and does not adequately address the implications of its findings beyond the specific case study of HER2 binders.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by integrating key methodological details into the main text rather than relegating them to the appendix. Additionally, providing a clearer motivation for frame averaging and addressing the complexities associated with it would enhance understanding. The authors should also expand the "Related Work" section to include comparisons with state-of-the-art antibody diffusion models and clarify the limitations of their approach. Furthermore, we suggest improving the clarity of the experimental setup and metrics in the main text, ensuring that definitions are easily accessible, and providing a more detailed explanation of the training dataset. Including a metric on the diversity and novelty of the sequences in the main text would also be beneficial. To enhance the justification for each component of the model, we encourage the authors to conduct head-to-head experiments with baselines for each new element introduced. Lastly, we recommend that the authors consider providing an updated manuscript that incorporates these clarifications and additional results to strengthen their submission.
