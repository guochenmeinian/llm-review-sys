Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a meta-corpus of six surface EMG (sEMG) gesture detection datasets and a benchmarking approach for evaluating algorithms on generalization across participants and adaptation within participants. The authors contribute a new high-density sEMG dataset and provide detailed documentation of the existing datasets, including gesture types and counts. They evaluate various featurization methods, such as raw, RMS, and time-frequency decomposed features, comparing gesture classification accuracy and area under the curve for generalization and adaptation tasks. The manuscript aims to harmonize algorithm benchmarking in the EMG field, addressing the challenges of generalization and adaptation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The manuscript is clear and easy to follow, with effective visual storytelling elements in the figures.
- It addresses critical problems in EMG research, facilitating common ground across various approaches and datasets.
- The appendix contains a comprehensive table summarizing the datasets, which is beneficial for the EMG community.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution primarily involves refactoring existing datasets rather than introducing entirely new datasets.
- Performance differences across various featurizations are minimal, indicating potential saturation in algorithmic breakthroughs.
- The datasets are limited in gesture types and lack challenging or real-world conditions.
- The benchmark's design assumes prior knowledge of gesture occurrences, which may not reflect real-world applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the originality of their contribution by introducing more novel datasets. Additionally, they should extend the benchmarking to include OOD generalization methods to clarify unresolved challenges. It is suggested to conduct experiments with multiple random seeds to enhance the robustness of the results. The authors should also address the model training overfitting issue related to early stopping and consider incorporating phase information between electrodes in their feature extraction methods. Lastly, we advise including a section on societal impacts and providing a model card or datasheet for the dataset to align with the track's recommendations.
