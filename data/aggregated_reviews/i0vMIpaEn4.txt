### Key Points
This paper presents a study on Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT), proposing a flexible approach that decouples the adaptive policy model from the translation model. The authors introduce DaP, a divergence-based adaptive policy that efficiently makes read/write decisions based on prediction discrepancies. Experimental results demonstrate that their method improves the translation accuracy and latency trade-off, outperforming the state-of-the-art ITST model. The paper is well-written and easy to understand, providing a novel method for constructing read/write supervision signals from a parallel training corpus.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed divergence-based policy is original and shows interpretability.
- The method achieves promising results, surpassing the current state-of-the-art ITST.
- The approach is memory and computation efficient, enhancing the trade-off between translation accuracy and latency.
- The paper is well-structured and presents the motivation clearly.

Weaknesses:
- The improvement in translation quality over the state-of-the-art ITST model is not significant but systematic across tasks and latency values.
- Potential issues with divergence-based policies may arise due to language pair differences, which could affect model performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 4.3 by adding formulas to explain the training objective of the R/W Policy Net. Additionally, the authors should provide a clearer explanation of the "READ or WRITE" terminology in Figure 5, as it may confuse readers regarding the learning process of the R/W Policy Net. We also suggest that the authors explore the joint fine-tuning of the Multi-path Wait-k Model and R/W Policy Net to enhance translation performance. Furthermore, experiments on the accuracy of the R/W Policy Net in predicting divergence and the statistical properties of the divergence matrix should be included. Lastly, a systematic analysis of whether to use an offline, frozen Multi-path Wait-k or a trainable version in the proposed method would be beneficial.
