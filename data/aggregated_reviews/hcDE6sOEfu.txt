Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents *HackAPrompt*, a large-scale, crowdsourced prompt hacking challenge aimed at understanding the manipulation of user input to make LLMs leak private information and override designer intentions. The authors provide a dataset of over 600k adversarial prompts generated during the competition, demonstrating that prompt hacking is feasible with a 54% success rate across 10 challenges on three LLMs (GPT-3, ChatGPT, FLAN-T5-XXL). Additionally, the authors develop an ontology of attack exploits and utilize GPT-4 to classify 200 prompts within this framework.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The competition is well-conceived and executed, raising awareness of the risks associated with prompted LLMs.
- The dataset of adversarial prompts is a valuable resource for further research on prompt hacking.
- The paper is well-organized and engaging, providing insightful analysis and examples of prompt attacks.

Weaknesses:
- The distinction between *goal hijacking* and *harmful information generation* is not convincingly addressed, and the claims regarding the coverage of six intents of prompt hacking lack sufficient support.
- The methodology for creating the ontology of attacks is not adequately described, and the introduction of terms in the appendix complicates comprehension.
- The paper contains typos, awkward phrasing, and formatting issues that hinder readability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their claims regarding *goal hijacking* and *harmful information generation* by providing additional discussions on how their results generalize to these areas. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors describe the methodology used to create the ontology of attacks more thoroughly and consider restructuring this section for better clarity. Additionally, addressing the identified typos and formatting issues will enhance the overall readability of the paper.
