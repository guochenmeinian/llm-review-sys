Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an Uncertainty-aware Inverse Propensity Score estimator (UIPS) aimed at improving off-policy learning by addressing the uncertainty in the estimated logging policy. The authors propose a closed-form solution for per-sample weight derived from a minimax optimization problem, which is crucial for understanding the non-linear relationship between uncertainty and sample weight. UIPS is theoretically analyzed for convergence and is shown to outperform several state-of-the-art baselines on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The authors also acknowledge the importance of incorporating historical data alongside newer data to better capture user preferences.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles a significant problem in off-policy learning and introduces a theoretically grounded method (UIPS) that enhances the quality of policy discovery.
- The theoretical foundation of the UIPS algorithm is rigorously established, enhancing its credibility and providing convergence guarantees.
- The integration of historical data with newer data is well-justified, offering a comprehensive approach to user preference modeling.
- The experimental methodology is solid, with sufficient detail for reproducibility, and the results indicate UIPS consistently outperforms numerous baselines.

Weaknesses:
- The practical importance of the problem addressed is questionable, as logging propensities are often available, raising concerns about the necessity of UIPS.
- The performance improvements of UIPS over existing methods are not substantial, leading to uncertainty about its practical utility.
- The manuscript is dense and lacks clarity in some sections, with insufficient discussion on the implications of uncertainty handling and the relationship between uncertainty and sample weights.
- The explanation of the "partial depiction" argument may require further clarification for readers, and the non-linear relationship between uncertainty and sample weight may need more intuitive exposition for broader understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the manuscript by providing more intuitive explanations and pedagogical examples to elucidate the method's workings. Additionally, a more thorough discussion on the practical implications of UIPS compared to existing methods, particularly in scenarios where logging propensities are available, would strengthen the paper. The authors should also consider including results that demonstrate the performance of baseline methods when combined with calibrated logging policy estimators, as well as addressing the potential computational costs associated with estimating uncertainties. Furthermore, we suggest improving the introduction by incorporating discussions about the problem's importance and expanding the section on the derived closed-form solution of the per-sample weight. Lastly, a clearer explanation of the "partial depiction" argument and elaboration on the non-linear relationship between uncertainty and sample weight would enhance reader comprehension and accessibility.
