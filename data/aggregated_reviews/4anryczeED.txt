Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for constructing confidence sequences using the likelihood ratio approach, suitable for well-specified likelihood problems. The authors analyze the geometry of likelihood ratio confidence sets for generalized linear models (GLMs) and propose a reweighting scheme to mitigate bias in estimators. They demonstrate the practical applicability of their method through numerical simulations in bandit problems, highlighting connections to online convex optimization and regret analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The integration of likelihood ratios into online decision-making is innovative and broadens the applicability of existing algorithms.  
- The adaptive reweighting scheme is well-justified and enhances practical bias estimation.  
- The theoretical insights regarding the geometry of confidence sets and their implications for regret bounds in GLM applications are valuable.

Weaknesses:  
- The absence of a concrete regret analysis for bandit problems undermines the proposed method's benefits, as the focus on regret is crucial in this context.  
- The organization of the paper could be improved, particularly in merging related contributions and clarifying claims.  
- Some experimental results lack statistical significance, raising concerns about their reliability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the integration of contributions by merging related sections to enhance coherence. Additionally, we urge the authors to include a concrete regret analysis for simple bandit problems, such as the K-armed bandit and linear bandit, to substantiate the method's effectiveness. Clarifying the relationship between the geometry of likelihood ratio confidence sets and Bregman divergences in the main text would also strengthen the paper. Furthermore, providing theoretical performance guarantees for the reweighting scheme and addressing the clarity of claims regarding the confidence set radius would enhance the manuscript's rigor. Lastly, ensuring that experimental results demonstrate statistical significance will bolster the empirical findings.
