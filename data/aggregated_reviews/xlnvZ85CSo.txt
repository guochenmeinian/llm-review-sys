### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of using mathematical problem-solving (MPS) data to enhance reasoning abilities in large language models (LLMs). The authors propose three training strategies: continual pretraining on mathematical texts, instruction pretraining on synthetic QA pairs, and instruction tuning on benchmark datasets. The findings indicate that only continual pretraining on mathematical text reliably improves broader reasoning skills, while the other methods do not. The authors differentiate between “AI for math” and “math for AI,” emphasizing the latter's potential for enhancing general reasoning skills.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The authors pose a clear research question and provide a thorough analysis of the impact of mathematical problem-solving on general reasoning abilities.  
- The findings reveal that most open-source math datasets do not support broader reasoning tasks, suggesting a necessary shift in research focus.  
- The study effectively addresses overfitting by incorporating general instruction-following data into math-related training and employing hybrid training methodologies.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper identifies challenges but lacks concrete solutions to address the limitations found.  
- It would benefit from an overview discussion of the underlying mathematical concepts, more detailed information about the datasets used, and an increased literature review for better contextualization.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by providing concrete solutions to the identified challenges. Additionally, including an overview discussion of the underlying mathematical concepts, offering more detailed information about the datasets used, and expanding the literature review would enhance contextualization and depth.
