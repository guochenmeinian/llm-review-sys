### Key Points
This paper presents GAuGE, a genetic approach that employs a balanced fitness function, integrating a cross-encoder model for relevance and an n-gram overlap metric to enhance grounding. This method demonstrates improved response generation by grounding in context, thereby reducing hallucination.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is clearly written.
2. GAuGE significantly enhances grounded answer generation accuracy while maintaining high relevance.
3. The experiments conducted across various LLMs indicate the generalizability of the approach.
4. The paper is well-structured, and the experimental analysis is exhaustive.
5. The integration of genetic algorithms with prompt-based methods is novel and exciting.

Weaknesses:
1. More analysis of GAuGE is needed to elucidate the benefits of the approach.
2. A comparison with other methods aimed at mitigating hallucination, such as "Trusting Your Evidence: Hallucinate Less with Context-aware Decoding," is necessary.
3. To assess the true mitigation of hallucination, results over counterfactual or new knowledge datasets would be valuable.
4. The differences between GAuGE and GEN2IR are not clearly articulated, and the unique contributions of this paper should be highlighted.
5. The methodology in Section 2 lacks clarity.
6. The focus on answer generation while employing a lexical method for first-stage retrieval and a cross-encoder model for re-ranking raises questions about the paper's fit within the "generative IR" topic of the workshop.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of GAuGE to better illustrate its benefits. Additionally, the authors should include comparisons with other hallucination mitigation approaches and provide results over counterfactual or new knowledge datasets to substantiate claims of hallucination reduction. Clarifying the distinctions between GAuGE and GEN2IR, as well as emphasizing the unique contributions of this paper, would enhance its impact. Furthermore, the authors should articulate the methodology in Section 2 more clearly and reconsider the alignment of their focus with the "generative IR" topic of the workshop.
