### Key Points
This paper presents a cross-domain sequential recommendation method, specifically Heterogeneous Graph Transfer Learning (HGTL), which addresses the challenge of knowledge transfer across domains with limited overlapping users. The authors construct a cross-domain heterogeneous graph to model associations between users, items, and categories, and employ a category-aware sequential preference learning module to capture preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms baseline models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is organized and generally clear, with a well-explained methodology and rigorous experimental support.  
- The proposed method effectively facilitates knowledge transfer through categories without relying heavily on overlapping users.  
- The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in improving recommendation accuracy.

Weaknesses:  
- The concept of using heterogeneous graphs is not innovative and lacks citations of existing work.  
- There are syntax errors and overly complex sentences that hinder readability.  
- The evaluation metrics used (NDCG@10 and HR@10) are insufficient; NDCG@20 and HR@20 should also be included.  
- The model's complexity raises concerns about computational cost and accessibility for practitioners.  
- The paper does not sufficiently explore edge expansion and semantic similarity in graph construction.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing by addressing syntax errors and simplifying overly complex sentences. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments to evaluate the proposed methods using NDCG@20 and HR@20 metrics for a more comprehensive assessment. It would also be beneficial to include more recent baseline methods to enhance the paper's persuasiveness. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide a detailed explanation of the edge expansion process based on semantic similarity and co-occurrence probability, including how these factors are quantified and integrated into the graph construction. Lastly, clarifying the computational complexity of the model, particularly regarding graph construction and knowledge transfer, would strengthen the paper.
