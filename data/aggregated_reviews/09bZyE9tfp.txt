Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of an advertiser's online high-dimensional lever decision problem with long-term constraints under limited bandit feedback across various input models. The authors propose a universally applicable algorithm and provide a theoretical regret analysis. The algorithm utilizes dual gradient descent to decouple decisions over time, achieving good performance across different payoff evolution models, including stochastic and adversarial settings. The main contributions include model formulation, algorithm development, and regret analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed algorithm is agnostic to input models, achieving high performance without prior knowledge of the decision-making environment.
- The adoption of random perturbation and expert-based decision-making is novel, with the regret analysis demonstrating significant insights, particularly in the proof of lemma 4.6.
- The organization and clarity of the paper are commendable.

Weaknesses:
- The concept of solving problems in multiple worlds is not novel, as analogous proofs exist for various input models.
- Several errors and unclear statements are present, including typographical errors and ambiguous terminology, which detract from the overall clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their writing, particularly in the proofs, by providing more discussion and intuition. Addressing the identified typographical errors and ambiguities, such as clarifying the meaning of "uncertain" and ensuring consistent notation, is essential. Additionally, we suggest including examples to justify the existence of a safe action and enhancing the discussion on the implications of the proposed algorithm in practical settings. Finally, we encourage the authors to proofread the paper thoroughly to catch any remaining typos and ensure the technical contributions are clearly articulated, especially in relation to existing literature.
