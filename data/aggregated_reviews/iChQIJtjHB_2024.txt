Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on stochastic polynomial optimization, focusing on the adaptation of the Sum-Of-Squares (SOS) hierarchy to handle random parameters. The authors propose a new method called Stochastic SOS (S-SOS) and provide convergence proofs for this method and the standard Lasserre approach. They demonstrate that the S-SOS method yields strict lower bounds on the optimal value of the cost function \( f(x, \omega) \) and achieves convergence rates of \( O(\frac{\log s}{s}) \) and \( O(\frac{1}{s^2}) \) for different parameterizations. The paper includes applications to sensor network localization, showcasing the practical advantages of the S-SOS technique.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces S-SOS, a novel hierarchy of relaxations for stochastic polynomial optimization.
- It provides asymptotic convergence results, particularly noting the surprising \( O(\frac{1}{s^2}) \) convergence rate achieved through piecewise constant approximations.
- The cluster-basis hierarchy is a significant and practical contribution, reducing the computational burden of solving SDPs.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical analysis is limited to trigonometric polynomials, lacking discussions on extensions to other polynomial classes and the implications of this restriction.
- The experiments are poorly designed, using a very small number of sensors (less than 15), which is significantly lower than the state of the art.
- The paper does not adequately explain the core ideas behind its results, making it frustrating to read, and lacks a comprehensive discussion of the cluster basis hierarchy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the core ideas behind their results, including a careful examination of the theorems and their limitations. Additionally, it would be beneficial to expand the theoretical analysis to include other classes of polynomials and address the challenges associated with such extensions. We suggest that the authors enhance the presentation of the cluster-basis hierarchy to provide a more in-depth understanding of its significance. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to conduct more robust experiments with a larger number of sensors to better demonstrate the practical advantages of their method. Lastly, a dedicated section discussing the limitations of their theoretical results and practical applications would greatly enhance the manuscript.
