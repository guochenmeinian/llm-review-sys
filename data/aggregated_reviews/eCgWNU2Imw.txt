Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents sparse Hopfield networks that utilize sparse retrieval dynamics akin to sparsemax attention mechanisms, resulting in robust sparse patterns against noise. The authors demonstrate fast convergence similar to modern Hopfield networks and establish a tighter lower bound for memory capacity in the sparse model compared to its dense counterpart. They introduce altered sparse variations of Hopfield layers for Deep Learning applications, showing their effectiveness on various image classification and multiple instance learning tasks. The approach notably enhances memory robustness against Gaussian noise.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The theoretical results, including Theorems and Lemmas, are well-supported and may influence future research in associative and biologically plausible Deep Learning. The authors provide source code for reproducibility.  
- The research goals are clearly articulated, and mathematical formatting is generally clear, with high-quality language used throughout, despite some grammatical errors.

Weaknesses:  
- The originality is limited, as sparse computation is a well-established area in Deep Learning, and the work represents an incremental advancement. The connection between Hopfield networks and attention mechanisms has been previously explored.  
- The introduction of multiple instance learning (MIL) tasks lacks clarity, particularly regarding the bit pattern experiment and the real-world tasks, which are insufficiently explained.  
- The potential computational advantages of sparse patterns are only briefly mentioned in the introduction and not elaborated upon in the manuscript. Minor errors, such as missing figures and typos, detract from the overall quality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction of MIL tasks to provide clearer explanations, especially for readers unfamiliar with the subject. Additionally, we suggest that the authors elaborate on the computational efficiency and noise-robustness of their method, including experiments comparing their approach with baseline models. A nomenclature section in the appendix defining all mathematical notations would enhance clarity. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to discuss the theoretical advantages of their model over previously studied dense associative memories and to provide visual examples of the model's performance in experiments to aid reader understanding. Lastly, a thorough proofreading to correct grammatical errors and typos is essential.
