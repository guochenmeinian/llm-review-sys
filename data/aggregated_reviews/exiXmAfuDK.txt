Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an algorithm for adaptive learning in environments with changing distributions, without prior knowledge of the drift. The proposed method aims to determine the optimal sliding window size for empirical risk minimization, enabling the learning of classifiers comparable to those with prior knowledge of distribution changes. The algorithm achieves a drifting-instance-dependent bound and provides theoretical guarantees on learning error.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses the significant challenge of non-stationary sequential learning with unknown distribution shifts, which is an important problem in the field.  
- The theoretical results are solid, and the proof techniques are clear.  
- The algorithm's simplicity enhances its comprehensibility, and it offers a new approach to designing learning algorithms under drift.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks numerical experiments to validate the proposed method's effectiveness.  
- Key assumptions, particularly regarding the computability of distribution discrepancies and the practicality of estimating parameters, require further justification and discussion.  
- The algorithm's reliance on parameters that are difficult to estimate may limit its practical applicability.  
- The formulation of the problem and the learning objectives at each time step need clearer explanation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including numerical experiments to demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness and superiority over existing methods. Additionally, a thorough discussion on the assumptions made, particularly regarding the computability of distribution discrepancies and their practical implications, should be included. It would also be beneficial to clarify the problem formulation and the specific learning objectives at each time step. Finally, we suggest updating the references to include more recent works related to the topic.
