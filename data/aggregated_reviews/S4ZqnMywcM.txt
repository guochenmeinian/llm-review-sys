Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for reconstructing images from spiking camera data, termed the Spatio-Temporal Interactive Reconstruction network (STIR). The authors propose an efficient architecture that optimizes inter-frame feature alignment and intra-frame feature filtering through a coarse-to-fine approach, utilizing components such as a hybrid spike embedding representation, a symmetric interactive attention block, and a multi-motion field estimation block. The method demonstrates high performance and low model complexity across synthetic and real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The joint motion-intensity learning architecture is innovative and addresses limitations of previous methods.
2. The paper is clearly written and easy to read.
3. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies validate the proposed method's effectiveness.
4. The results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms related works.

Weaknesses:
1. The overall architecture is complex, potentially complicating implementation or adaptation.
2. Limited theoretical justification exists for why this approach works better than others.
3. Certain sections, such as the description of Spike-Based Image Reconstruction, are confusing and require clarification.
4. The experiments lack sufficient detail for reproducibility, particularly regarding tools and parameter values.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the confusing aspects in Section 2 regarding CNNs and SNNs. Additionally, in Section 4, it would be beneficial to provide a detailed top-level algorithm that describes all operations involved in the proposed methodology. For Section 5.1, please include comprehensive details about the experimental setup, including all tools and parameter values used to ensure reproducibility. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors discuss the theoretical foundations of their approach to strengthen the justification for its effectiveness. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore the generalization of their results across a wider variety of benchmarks beyond the SREDS dataset.
