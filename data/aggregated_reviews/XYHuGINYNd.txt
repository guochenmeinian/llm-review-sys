### Key Points
This paper presents the GraphHAM model, which addresses the challenge of timely detecting social events on social media by combining Hyperbolic space and automatic meta-path selection. The authors claim that this model efficiently selects meta-paths, converts them into vectors, and utilizes a Hyperbolic Multi-Layer Perceptron to capture semantic and structural information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphHAM achieves outstanding performance with only 20% of the dataset used for training, suggesting it is a promising solution for social event detection.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- A wide range of evaluations, including 7 research questions, 3 datasets, 6 baselines, performance comparisons, ablation studies, time efficiency, and parameter analysis.
- Clear illustration of the proposed framework.
- Fast training time despite graph representation learning.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for using hyperbolic space is unclear; examples illustrating its necessity for capturing unlabeled data would be beneficial.
- The novelty of the approach is questionable, as similar methods exist, such as GraphMSE, which also employs automatic meta-path selection.
- The intuition behind the framework is not well articulated, particularly regarding the selection of points for meta-path enumeration.
- The contribution appears incremental, combining existing techniques without significant innovation.
- The problem formulation lacks clarity, particularly regarding the specific social items being detected.
- Section 5.6 may be misplaced, as it discusses dataset statistics that could fit better in the experimental settings.
- The reasons for the model's performance with limited training data require further exploration.
- A summary of the end-to-end training and testing processes would enhance clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for using hyperbolic space by providing motivating examples. Additionally, the authors should clarify the novelty of their approach by discussing the challenges associated with applying hyperbolic space for social event detection. It would be beneficial to elucidate the intuition behind the framework, particularly the concept of selected points for meta-path enumeration. We suggest that the authors strengthen their contribution by highlighting unique aspects of their methodology compared to existing works. Clarifying the problem formulation in Section 3 is essential, as is the potential relocation of Section 5.6 to the experimental settings. We encourage the authors to investigate and explain why the model performs well with limited training data and to summarize the end-to-end training and testing processes for better comprehension.
