Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a formalization and experimental verification of the thesis that a quantum state $\vert\phi\rangle$ is the local minimum in the process of QNN training. The authors propose a no-go theorem revealing that the probability of avoiding local minima decreases exponentially with the number of qubits while increasing polynomially with circuit depth. The curvature of local minima is determined by quantum Fisher information and a loss-dependent constant. The findings provide insights into the scalability and learnability of QNNs, particularly in the context of quantum state learning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a rigorous and quantitative theoretical analysis of the limitations of QNNs in quantum state learning.
- It includes extensive numerical simulations that validate the theoretical results.
- The work explores the trainability of quantum neural networks and offers insights into the role of prior information.

Weaknesses:
- The significance of the results may be limited, as some conclusions appear expected and follow previous works.
- The theoretical analysis is primarily applicable to pure state learning, lacking generalization to mixed or noisy states.
- The paper does not adequately address how to avoid the observed effects of local minima, nor does it explore the implications of different loss functions or circuit structures.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the significance of their findings, particularly regarding the implications of their results for practical applications. Additionally, the authors should consider generalizing their theoretical analysis to include mixed states and explore the applicability of their conclusions to various loss functions. It would also be beneficial to provide a more detailed examination of strategies to avoid local minima and clarify the choice of circuit structures used in numerical experiments.
