### Key Points
This paper presents a model for human learning of abstract symbolic concepts through induction, utilizing a language model as a meta-prior, which is fine-tuned to create a task-specific prior over hypotheses from a limited number of human samples. The model integrates this prior into a Bayesian inference framework to address inductive reasoning tasks, demonstrating alignment with human judgments and suggesting that natural language serves as a superior hypothesis space compared to programming languages. Additionally, the authors introduce a structured Bayesian cognitive model that requires less "tinkering" and smaller sampling budgets compared to previous models. They emphasize the generalizability of their theoretical framework, balancing domain-specific modeling choices with the introduction of new degrees of freedom, while addressing concerns about terminology, particularly regarding "inference" and "utterance," and clarifying their alignment with existing literature on Bayesian Program Learning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach combines Bayesian inference with neural network models, leveraging their complementary strengths.
- The model demonstrates improved efficiency with less need for parameter adjustment and shows compelling alignment with human data.
- The paper is well-contextualized within existing literature and addresses significant questions regarding tractability versus expressivity.
- The authors provide a thoughtful discussion on the generalizability of their framework, suggesting it may require less domain-specific tinkering.
- Responses to reviewer feedback indicate a willingness to refine terminology and clarify concepts.

Weaknesses:
- The abstract lacks specificity and should be expanded to include key results and concepts like calibration.
- The reliance on natural language introduces ambiguity, which may complicate the inference process.
- Some terminology, such as "inference," may be misleading and requires careful reconsideration.
- The paper's main contribution is unclear; it should specify whether it proposes a new hypothesis about human learning or merely makes existing hypotheses tractable.
- The paper's reliance on specific language models and engineering decisions could limit its applicability in broader contexts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the abstract by elaborating on calibration and key results to enhance clarity. Additionally, providing more implementation details in Sections 4 and 5 would benefit future readers. It would be helpful to clarify the strength of the prior and likelihood functions, and to explore the implications of using different models for these components. We suggest including a discussion on potential adversarial tasks that could challenge the framework, as well as a more robust credit assignment analysis of the pipeline's components. Furthermore, we recommend improving the clarity of terminology by changing the title to exclude "Bayesian Inference over Natural Language" and considering the removal of "utterance" if it may mislead readers. Lastly, we suggest further elaboration on how the model's generalizability can be validated across different datasets and contexts, ensuring that the theoretical framework is robust against varying engineering choices.
