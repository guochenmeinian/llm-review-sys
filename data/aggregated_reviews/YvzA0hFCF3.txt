### Key Points
This paper presents a multimodal video summarization task and dataset, extending Activitynet captions to facilitate multi-modal video summarization. The authors propose a framework for selecting relevant frames and generating corresponding captions, addressing challenges in frame selection and evaluation metrics. They introduce a new benchmark dataset for Multi-VidSum, emphasizing the evaluation process with baseline methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors contribute a novel multimodal video summarization task and dataset, enhancing multimodal research.
- The manuscript is well-written, with a thorough literature review and solid baseline methods.
- The evaluation criterion for Multi-VidSum is straightforward and simple.

Weaknesses:
- The necessity and novelty of multimodal video summarization compared to dense video captioning are not clearly articulated.
- Evidence supporting the effectiveness of the median frame caption for keyframe selection is lacking; alternative methods like importance sampling could be explored.
- An ablation study for architectural changes is missing, and feeding all frames to the encoder may pose scalability issues.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the necessity and importance of their proposed task and datasets compared to dense video captioning. Additionally, the authors should provide evidence for the effectiveness of their iterative refinement approach and consider exploring alternative frame selection methods. Including an ablation study for architectural changes would strengthen the manuscript, and addressing scalability concerns by developing a model that selects frames for generating salient keyframes would be beneficial.
