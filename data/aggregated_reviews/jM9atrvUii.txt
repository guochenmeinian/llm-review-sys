Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a family of Gaussian process-based regression models for predicting protein variant effects, utilizing a "composite" kernel that incorporates structural information and embeddings from pre-trained models like ESM2 and ProteinMPNN. The authors demonstrate promising predictive performance on the ProteinGym benchmark, particularly regarding uncertainty metrics such as expected calibration error (ECE). The method shows substantial improvement over state-of-the-art predictions and includes a user-friendly codebase for practitioners.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors contribute significantly to a relevant problem in the NeurIPS community, integrating machine learning with protein modeling and addressing uncertainty quantification.
- The empirical evaluation is comprehensive, leveraging the ProteinGym benchmark and including multiple ablation studies.
- The model's performance is commendable, especially in scenarios with limited mutations, and it efficiently utilizes pre-trained neural network features.

Weaknesses:
- The discussion of the Kermut kernel is unclear and could benefit from better organization and motivation for design choices.
- The paper lacks a thorough exploration of alternative kernel constructions and their implications, such as the potential use of a product kernel $k_{\rm struct} \times k_{\rm seq}$.
- There is insufficient discussion on the computational complexity of the kernel concerning sequence length and mutation count.
- The literature review is inadequate, particularly regarding prior work on sequence kernels and Gaussian processes in protein modeling, which should be expanded for clarity and depth.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and organization of the Kermut kernel discussion, particularly in sections that may confuse readers regarding the model's development. It would be beneficial to foreshadow the transition from single to multi-mutant constructions more effectively. Additionally, the authors should include a more detailed exploration of alternative kernel choices and their potential impact, possibly through ablation studies. A discussion on the computational complexity of the kernel in relation to sequence length and mutation count is necessary. Finally, we encourage the authors to enhance the literature review by incorporating relevant prior work on sequence kernels and Gaussian processes, potentially relegating some discussions to an appendix for conciseness.
