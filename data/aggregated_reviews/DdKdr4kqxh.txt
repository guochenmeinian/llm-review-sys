Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to efficiently identify extreme anomaly events from climate data, addressing the temporal delays and spatially uneven responses of these events. The authors construct three comprehensive datasets, including synthetic and real-world data, and propose an end-to-end spatio-temporal anomaly detection network model featuring independent spatio-temporal encoders and a compact quantization layer. Additionally, the authors introduce a methodology for identifying spatio-temporal drivers of extreme events, utilizing input variables such as albedo and soil temperature. While the models achieve similar performance in extreme detection, they struggle with identifying drivers due to artifacts and missing influences. The authors acknowledge the potential for improvement by exploring other indicators like SPEI, SPI, PDSI, or SMA in future work and plan to document their code to facilitate the selection of different input variables.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper tackles an important issue in climate science: identifying extreme anomaly events, which is crucial for understanding climate patterns and has significant applications in agriculture and social activities.
2. The construction of datasets approximating historical Earth systems is commendable, addressing reliability issues with remote sensing data.
3. The end-to-end neural network solution, despite limited technical innovations, achieves impressive performance, supported by thorough experimental comparisons.
4. The methodology is creative and offers a novel approach to identifying drivers of extreme events, with convincing additional results on Integrated Gradients (IG) demonstrating the model's capabilities in extreme detection.

Weaknesses:
1. Extensive preprocessing and dataset adaptation are required, yet the lack of released code and data details limits reproducibility and future research.
2. The focus appears to be limited to regional-level anomaly detection, which may not adequately capture the interconnected dynamics of the global Earth system.
3. The writing and presentation require improvement, particularly for interdisciplinary accessibility, as necessary background knowledge is not sufficiently provided.
4. The performance of the models in identifying drivers is subpar, which may affect the validity of interpretations, and the choice of input variables, particularly albedo and soil temperature, may limit the paper's impact.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction to datasets and code to enhance reproducibility and facilitate future research. Additionally, consider addressing the overwhelming contributions from the problem and dataset introduction relative to the method itself, potentially shifting the focus to the datasets and benchmarks track. To enhance scalability, we suggest exploring alternative backbone networks for global-level spatiotemporal anomaly detection. We also recommend reconsidering the use of albedo and soil temperature as inputs, potentially focusing on atmospheric and hydrological indicators instead. Clarifying the terminology used for anomalies and extreme events is essential, and we encourage the authors to provide illustrative examples to aid reader comprehension. Furthermore, we suggest elaborating on the limitations of weaker predictive models in Section 6 to clarify how this affects the validity of their conclusions. Lastly, addressing the clarity of experimental design and the low predictive skill on real-world data is crucial for strengthening the paper's scientific validity, and we encourage the authors to revise the paper title to reflect the changes in terminology regarding anomalies and extreme events.
