Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel architecture called the Adversarial Point Cloud Transformer (APCT), which aims to enhance the robustness of 3D perception models against real-world corruptions. The APCT integrates two core components: the Adversarial Significance Identifier, which identifies significant tokens by analyzing global context, and the Target-guided Promptor, which focuses the model's attention on less dominant tokens. The authors propose that this approach mitigates overfitting on specific patterns and enhances generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that APCT achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple corruption benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of APCT addresses the challenge of robust 3D perception in the presence of corrupted data.
- The integration of the Adversarial Significance Identifier and Target-guided Promptor effectively improves model resilience against various corruptions.
- The experiments are comprehensive, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method across multiple benchmarks.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation requires improvement, particularly in the abstract and the clarity of certain terms, such as "local pattern."
- The experiments lack comparisons with similar previous works like PointDP and do not explore additional complex corruption scenarios.
- The impact of the proposed method on computational overhead is not thoroughly discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the abstract and provide a formal definition of "local pattern." Additionally, clarification on the differences between the confusion matrices in Figure 1 would be beneficial. The authors should evaluate the adversarial mechanism using different tokenization methods to validate robustness and include experiments demonstrating the broader applicability of the proposed method to other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the authors should revise the notation in the focal tokens identification section for clarity and provide a detailed explanation of the process for selecting the top-k tokens. Lastly, addressing the impact on computational overhead and including comparisons with data augmentation methods like PointMixUp and PointCutMix would strengthen the paper.
