Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the self-attention mechanism in Transformers, focusing on the asymptotic behavior of tokens processed by infinitely deep self-attention architectures. The authors analyze the convergence of the self-attention matrix to a low-rank matrix and demonstrate that tokens cluster towards specific configurations, such as the vertices of a convex polytope or hyperplanes, depending on the value matrix \( V \). The study interprets self-attention through the lens of interacting particle systems, revealing the emergence of clusters in the dynamics of Transformers.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a significant theoretical foundation for understanding self-attention mechanisms, an area that remains underexplored.
- The authors effectively illustrate the clustering behavior of tokens across various scenarios, contributing original insights to the field.
- The writing is clear and the results are well-presented, making the complex mathematical concepts accessible.

Weaknesses:
- The assumptions regarding the proofs, such as the conditions for \( Q^T K \succ 0 \), may not be realistic for standard Transformers, raising concerns about the applicability of the results.
- The analysis is heavily mathematical, which may hinder comprehension for a general machine learning audience.
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion of the limitations of the assumptions used in the theoretical results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the relationship between the clustered configuration and the initial configuration within the main text. Additionally, please address the apparent contradiction with the results in [SABP22] regarding clustering effects and provide insights on the implications for downstream applications. It would be beneficial to elaborate on the unique mathematical challenges posed by transformer dynamics and strengthen the contribution by incorporating layer normalization. We also suggest providing more intuition regarding the geometric meaning of the vertices in relation to the initial distribution of tokens and discussing the implications of different embeddings. Lastly, consider conducting numerical experiments to assess the sensitivity of clustering behavior to the addition of MLP layers.
