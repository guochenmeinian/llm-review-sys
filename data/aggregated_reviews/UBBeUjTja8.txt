Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework, CRCL, for addressing the challenge of noisy correspondences in image-text matching. The authors propose a complementary active loss (ACL) and a self-refining correspondence correction (SCC) technique to enhance robustness against noisy pairs. The framework is shown to outperform state-of-the-art methods through both theoretical and empirical evidence, demonstrating significant improvements in performance across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The CRCL framework is a general and flexible approach that integrates well with existing methods, enhancing robustness in image-text matching.
2. The paper is well-written, with clear explanations and motivations for the proposed method.
3. The authors simplify the training process by focusing on the loss function and correction technique, avoiding the complexity of co-teaching schemes.
4. Experimental results are impressive, showing that CRCL improves the performance of pre-trained models like CLIP.

Weaknesses:
1. There are typos, such as "CSRL" instead of "CRCL" and "i_j" instead of "I_j".
2. The related work section is incomplete, lacking comparisons with recent methods in image-text matching.
3. Some equations, particularly Eq.1 and Eq.11, are confusing and require clearer definitions and explanations.
4. The paper does not provide a direct comparison with RCL, which could offer insights into performance differences.
5. The organization of the sections discussing ACL and SCC lacks clarity, making it difficult to understand their relationship.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the related work section by including and comparing with recent studies in image-text matching. Additionally, please clarify the definitions and derivations of terms in Eq.1 and Eq.11. We suggest providing a more detailed discussion on the relationship between ACL and SCC to enhance the manuscript's coherence. Furthermore, consider including Plausible-Match R-Precision (PMRP) as an evaluation metric, as it may be more suitable for many-to-many matching evaluations. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explain the intuition behind SCC and justify their choice of datasets, addressing how the one-to-many correspondences affect their method's applicability.
