Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the time complexity of parallel stochastic optimization, establishing new lower bounds and proposing algorithms that achieve these bounds. The authors propose a new method, Rennala SGD, which is shown to be faster than previous synchronous and asynchronous methods in the homogeneous case. Additionally, the work introduces an oracle-based lower bound on optimal convergence rates in time rather than iterations, emphasizing the significance of asynchronous methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work contributes to practical asynchronous optimization methods, providing convergence rates and complexity bounds that reflect real-world convergence time.
- The theoretical analysis is sound and offers surprising insights, particularly regarding the benefits of ignoring certain computations.
- The writing is clear and well-structured, aiding in the understanding of the contributions.

Weaknesses:
- There is a lack of empirical evaluations, with the only experiments conducted on quadratics and located in the appendix. Small-scale numerical results on diverse machine learning workloads are needed.
- The assumption of fixed computation time for each worker is restrictive and impractical; the authors should explore extending their framework to accommodate arbitrary, bounded worker delays.
- The organization of the paper is somewhat confusing, with assumptions introduced late and related work poorly positioned.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical evaluation by including experiments comparing Rennala SGD with asynchronous SGD and minibatch SGD on various convex functions. Additionally, consider discussing how the findings might change if the model allowed for stochastic delays rather than fixed ones. Clarifying the challenges of theoretical analysis and reorganizing the paper for better flow would also enhance readability. Finally, addressing the limitations of the fixed delay model and its implications on the results would strengthen the paper's applicability.
