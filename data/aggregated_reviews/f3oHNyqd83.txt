Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents LongMIL, a hierarchical method that combines local and global attention mechanisms to address the low-rank bottleneck in multiple instance learning (MIL) for computational pathology. The authors demonstrate LongMIL's superior performance and computational efficiency through extensive evaluations across various feature encoders and tasks, including subtyping and survival analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The computation of attention for long sequences in whole slide images (WSI) is a significant challenge, and the authors provide a valuable analysis of the low-rank and sparsity issues in attention matrices.
- LongMIL shows improved results compared to baseline methods in both subtyping and prognostic tasks.
- The paper includes thorough ablation studies and a detailed examination of various feature encoders.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of LongMIL is questioned, as it bears similarities to existing methods like HIPT, and the authors do not sufficiently differentiate their approach.
- The motivation regarding the low-rank nature of MIL is not entirely convincing, as the authors should address morphological redundancy in WSI and evaluate their method on datasets with fewer patches.
- The presentation suffers from numerous typographical errors, unclear figures, and a lack of systematic organization, making it difficult to follow.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the manuscript by addressing typographical errors and reorganizing the presentation of results. Specifically, consider consolidating results into comprehensive tables for easier comparison of MIL architectures and pretrained encoders. Additionally, we suggest expanding on the novelty of LongMIL by clearly differentiating it from HIPT and discussing the implications of morphological redundancy in WSI. To strengthen the motivation, evaluate LongMIL on tissue biopsies or tissue microarrays to demonstrate its effectiveness in non-low-rank settings. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore the use of recent pathology foundation models in future studies to enhance their comparisons.
