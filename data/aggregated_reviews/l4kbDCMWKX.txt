### Key Points
This paper presents the GraphCSR method, a novel sparse matrix storage format designed for large-scale graph processing, which builds on the traditional Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format. The authors propose that by grouping vertices based on low-edge degrees, GraphCSR significantly reduces storage requirements and runtime memory consumption. The paper includes extensive experimental results demonstrating improvements in memory efficiency and execution speed, particularly for BFS and SpMV operations, using industry-standard benchmarks and real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- GraphCSR offers substantial memory savings while maintaining high processing speed, making it suitable for large-scale applications.
- The use of real-world datasets and industry-standard benchmarks enhances the credibility of the results.
- The rigorous evaluation on larger scales than most existing studies contributes valuable insights to the field.

Weaknesses:
- The method description is brief, lacking detailed explanations of design choices and innovation.
- The experimental section is disorganized, with insufficient details on dataset selection, experimental setup, and baseline comparisons.
- The paper does not adequately discuss the impact of the parameter Thr or its implications across different graph structures.
- Internal implementation details, particularly regarding the transition between low-degree and high-degree vertices, are vague.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method description by providing a more formal definition of GraphCSR and a detailed discussion of its complexity. Additionally, the authors should enhance the experimental section by clearly defining datasets, baselines, and the specific goals of each experiment. A thorough exploration of the parameter Thr across various graph structures would provide clearer guidelines for users. We also suggest refining the figures for better readability and ensuring that the internal implementation details are explicitly outlined, particularly regarding the handling of low-degree and high-degree vertices. Finally, a discussion on the scalability of GraphCSR in different distributed environments, including edge computing, would strengthen the paper's contributions.
