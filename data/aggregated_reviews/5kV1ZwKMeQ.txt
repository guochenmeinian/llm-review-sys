### Key Points
This paper presents a comparison of 12 modern instruction-tuned LLMs, including GPT-4 and Bard, in their ability to write creative fiction based on a specific prompt. The authors employ a detailed rubric grounded in literary criticism to evaluate the generated stories, which are rated by human evaluators. The findings indicate that commercial LLMs, particularly GPT-4 and Claude 1.2, outperform human writers in aggregate ratings, although human writers excel in originality. The paper also discusses the limitations of the research, particularly its narrow focus and the lack of training for human evaluators.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research question is clearly defined and well-addressed.
- The methodology is robust, including efforts to minimize exposure bias and the use of high-quality human evaluators.
- The insights into LLM capabilities in creative writing are compelling and provide a unique perspective.

Weaknesses:
- The research question's limited focus is a significant limitation.
- The human evaluators lacked training tasks for rating calibration.
- The paper does not sufficiently explore the inner workings of LLMs or provide a detailed analysis of the evaluation process.
- The proposed corpus of stories is not available for review, which affects reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the annotation process by detailing the specific instructions given to evaluators and the platform used for rating. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide training tasks for human evaluators to enhance rating calibration. To strengthen the paper's contributions, we encourage the authors to include a more in-depth analysis of the LLMs' inner workings and to make the entire corpus publicly available for review to support reproducibility.
