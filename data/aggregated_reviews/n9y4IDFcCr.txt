### Key Points
This paper presents a new automatic metric, GROOViST, to assess the quality of Visual Storytelling systems, specifically addressing temporal misalignments and grounding in generated visual stories. The authors demonstrate the weaknesses of existing metrics, particularly RoVIST-VG, and show that GROOViST correlates better with human judgment. The methodology for evaluating automatic metrics is sound, and the experimental results support the effectiveness of the proposed metric.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-motivated and provides a thorough examination of the limitations of current metrics.
- Experimental results validate the effectiveness of GROOViST, showing improvements over previous metrics.
- The writing is clear, with detailed problem descriptions and a sound methodology.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a detailed exploration of how the proposed metric applies to various visual storytelling methods, limiting its generalization.
- There is insufficient evaluation of the modularity of GROOViST, particularly regarding the contributions of individual components to performance improvements.
- The analysis does not adequately address how negative scores for noun phrases contribute to interpretability or performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the temporal alignment discussion in Section 3, explicitly mentioning how GROOViST addresses this aspect. Additionally, please specify the tools used for noun phrase extraction and the method for extracting object bounding boxes in relation to CLIP. Providing a distribution of samples for high/low T and P would enhance understanding of the metric's performance across datasets. Finally, we suggest conducting ablation studies to evaluate the impact of each component of GROOViST and clarify the rationale behind attributing negative scores to noun phrases.
