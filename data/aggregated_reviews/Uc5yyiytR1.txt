Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a class of latent DAG models that facilitate hierarchical structures among latent variables, allowing for more general relationships than previously considered models. The authors demonstrate that, under specific conditions on the Jacobians of causal mechanisms, the latent variables are identifiable up to a component-wise invertible transformation. Additionally, the authors examine causal structure learning under specific assumptions, including faithfulness, minimality, and the pure child assumption, asserting that these assumptions are necessary for achieving asymptotic correctness in their models. They clarify the deterministic relations between exogenous variables and observed variables, emphasizing the importance of invertibility in preserving information. The paper concludes with experiments indicating that the latent variables are recovered with a high level of accuracy, and the inclusion of additional experimental results strengthens the empirical basis of their claims.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The allowance for non-linear relationships and the generality of the latent structure represent significant advancements over prior works.  
- The theoretical results are solid and supported by experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.  
- The paper is logically structured and well-written, with intuitive explanations that enhance accessibility.  
- The authors provide a thorough response to reviewer concerns, demonstrating engagement and willingness to improve their work.  
- They clarify complex concepts, such as deterministic relations and measurement models, enhancing the transparency of their methodology.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks clarity, requiring substantial rewriting to address inconsistencies, particularly regarding deterministic functions versus conditional probabilities, and the assumptions made in theorems.  
- Important related works on identifying latent causal graphs from interventional data are omitted, which could provide crucial context regarding the trade-offs between structural assumptions and the availability of interventional data.  
- The combination of strong assumptions (faithfulness, minimality, pure child assumption, and invertibility) raises concerns about the robustness and significance of the results.  
- The necessity of these assumptions is not rigorously demonstrated, which may weaken the overall argument for their validity.  
- The experimental section is insufficiently detailed and lacks comprehensiveness, particularly in evaluating performance across varying sample sizes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by addressing the following points:  
1. Clearly distinguish between deterministic functions and conditional probabilities, ensuring that the assumptions for the theorems are mutually consistent.  
2. Gradually introduce concepts in Algorithm 1, providing examples to illustrate the necessity of each step and considering moving less essential steps to the appendix.  
3. Enhance the rigor of the argumentation regarding the necessity of their assumptions, particularly in the context of combining multiple strong assumptions.  
4. Clarify the definition of the measurement models used and consider retaining the original naming conventions to avoid confusion.  
5. Enhance the experimental section by including detailed descriptions of the experiments, such as how perfect prediction tests are conducted and the number of random seeds used for averaging results. Additionally, evaluate the method's performance across a range of sample sizes to demonstrate consistency.  
6. Include a discussion on the computational complexity and provide wall clock comparisons with other baselines in high-dimensional problems.  
7. Address the concerns regarding the assumptions made, particularly the faithfulness, pure child, and invertibility assumptions, by providing justifications for their necessity or discussing potential relaxations.
