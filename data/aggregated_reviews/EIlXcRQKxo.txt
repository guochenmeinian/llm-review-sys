### Key Points
This paper presents new methods (GBRL and ICRL) for eliciting steganography in LLMs, contributing to LLM security research. The authors demonstrate that steganographic collusion can occur as an unintended consequence of optimization pressure, even without explicit prompting. They show that a sender LLM can effectively hide information from an overseer LLM while communicating with a receiver LLM across various contexts. The findings indicate that current mitigation strategies, such as paraphrasing and overseer monitoring, can often be circumvented by adaptively optimized collusion teams.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The core finding that steganographic collusion can emerge organically is novel and of broad interest.  
- The authors demonstrate this phenomenon across multiple contexts and learning strategies, indicating its generalizability.  
- The paper provides an interesting treatment of the topic, contributing to the discussion on LLM security.

Weaknesses:  
- The evaluation focuses solely on cases with asymmetric capabilities, where the overseer is less capable and not allowed to learn, which may not reflect more realistic scenarios.  
- The framing around a supervisory mechanism whose goals are not integrated into the agent reward function may be misleading or overly simplistic.  
- The paper lacks a detailed exploration of more effective alignment strategies beyond external supervision.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including scenarios where the overseer is allowed to learn and has similar capabilities to the sender and receiver LLMs. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the limitations of the supervisory mechanism used and exploring alternative alignment strategies that could better reflect real-world applications. Finally, we encourage the authors to develop an analytical framework that leverages access to the internal state of the models, potentially incorporating white-box detection strategies for more effective mitigation.
