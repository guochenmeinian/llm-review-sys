Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for eliciting complex multivariate probability densities from experts using normalizing flows. The authors propose to model the belief density with a flow-based approach, addressing challenges such as training with limited samples and ensuring the samples are drawn from a known distribution. Bayesian inference is utilized to optimize the parameters of the belief density through MAP estimation, with empirical evaluations demonstrating the method's effectiveness on synthetic and real datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The application of normalizing flows to expert knowledge elicitation is novel and promising.
- The proposed method is effective and supported by theoretical guarantees.

Weaknesses:
- Some definitions and formulas lack clarity, particularly regarding the relationship between variables in Proposition 2.1 and the use of symbols like $\mathcal{D}$ and $\mathbb{x}$.
- The experiments lack variety, as they primarily use k = 5, and do not include baseline comparisons or quantitative metrics for evaluation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of definitions and formulas, particularly in Proposition 2.1 and Assumption 3. Additionally, we suggest including a broader range of experiments with varying values of k, especially k = 2, to assess the method's performance in more realistic scenarios. It would also be beneficial to establish baseline comparisons and provide quantitative metrics to evaluate the proposed method's effectiveness. Lastly, a discussion on the implications of fixing the prior's precision and the choice of using flow-based models over traditional methods would enhance the paper's depth.
