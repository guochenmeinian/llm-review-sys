Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DirectFaaS, a novel network architecture aimed at enhancing communication in serverless computing platforms by decoupling control and data flows. This design reduces the overhead associated with API gateways and employs a virtual switch to implement necessary functions. Evaluations conducted in a production serverless environment demonstrate that DirectFaaS effectively decreases application execution time.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- DirectFaaS successfully reduces API gateway overhead by separating control and data flows, leading to improved application execution times.
- The paper is well-written, with clear motivation and technical descriptions.

Weaknesses:
- The functions, operations, and evaluation of the virtual switch are inadequately described.
- The novelty of the approach is questioned, as existing serverless platforms already support direct function chaining.
- The evaluation lacks comparisons with other mechanisms beyond the OpenFaaS baseline.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the operations of the virtual switch, particularly how it updates its rules via the API. Additionally, providing an evaluation of the time and overhead associated with rule updates in the virtual switch would strengthen the paper. 

The authors should clarify the granularity of authorization and compare it between the API gateway and network policies, addressing whether IP-level authorization is sufficient. 

We also suggest including evaluations of the number of rules in the virtual switch under varying application scenarios and worker node counts, as this impacts performance. 

Furthermore, the authors should enhance the motivation section by demonstrating how the centralized API gateway contributes to latency, specifically detailing the latency between the API gateway and worker nodes. 

Lastly, a more thorough discussion on security and traffic isolation, as well as potential issues with the SDN-based approach, should be included, along with a comprehensive review of related work beyond the immediate FaaS context.
