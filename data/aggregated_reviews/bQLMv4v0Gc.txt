### Key Points
This paper investigates metaphor identification datasets, concluding that existing datasets can be utilized by disregarding the context of target words. The authors conducted multiple experiments to assess the impact of sampling methods across various datasets, revealing biases that affect future usage. They employed two baselines—masking the metaphorical expression and using only the metaphorical expression—compared to a default model that incorporates context.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a benchmark of several dataset versions, serving as a valuable reference.
- It reveals biases that directly impact the future application of the studied datasets.
- The hypothesis and methodology are well-defined, utilizing BERT to assess the hypothesis through input ablation.

Weaknesses:
- The conclusions drawn are overly strong given the limited performance improvements across datasets; deeper analysis is needed.
- Statistical significance is lacking, which jeopardizes the reproducibility of results.
- The evaluation of the sampling method was restricted to the VUA dataset, limiting generalizability.
- The paper does not include examples to clarify findings, and the second claim regarding natural distributions is insufficiently supported.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the depth of analysis in the discussion section to support their conclusions more robustly. Additionally, including statistical significance would enhance the reproducibility of results. The authors should consider providing examples from datasets to illustrate their findings clearly. Furthermore, we suggest evaluating the sampling method across more datasets to establish generalizability. Lastly, incorporating a human baseline would significantly strengthen the paper's claims regarding the reliance on PME and context for determining metaphoricity.
