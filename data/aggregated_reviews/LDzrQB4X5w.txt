Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithms for multi-armed bandits (MAB) with delayed feedback, eliminating the need for prior knowledge of the maximum delay \(d_{\text{max}}\). The authors propose that regret scales with the number of outstanding observations \(\sigma_{\text{max}}\) rather than the delay length, achieved through a new round skipping rule, an implicit exploration loss estimator, and advanced analysis. The results provide upper bounds for both stochastic and adversarial settings, improving upon previous works.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The significant regret guarantee scales with the number of missing observations, avoiding linear regret associated with delays.
- The introduction of implicit exploration for BOBW settings is novel, and the algorithm design effectively combines techniques to handle excessive delays.

Weaknesses:
- The term "distribution drift/shift" is introduced without sufficient context, making it unclear in relation to delayed bandits.
- Inconsistent terminology is used, such as "multiarm" and "multi-arm."
- The contribution summary is overly detailed and could be streamlined.
- The explanation of the additional \(K^{1/3}\) factor and its implications for BOBW guarantees lacks depth.
- Key elements of Lemma 2 should be outlined upon its introduction to aid reader comprehension.
- Relevant works on feedback-delayed bandits are not adequately discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the term "distribution drift/shift" in the introduction to provide context. Additionally, we suggest standardizing the terminology to consistently use "multi-arm." The contribution summary should be polished to enhance informativeness, potentially merging points 2-4. We encourage the authors to elaborate on the significance of the \(K^{1/3}\) factor in the analysis and to clarify the key elements leading to Lemma 2. Furthermore, discussing the two relevant works on feedback-delayed bandits would strengthen the paper's context and relevance.
