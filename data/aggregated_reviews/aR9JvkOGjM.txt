Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the online convex optimization problem with delayed bandit feedback, proposing a new algorithm that employs a block updating mechanism with FTRL. The authors demonstrate that this algorithm achieves a delay-dependent regret of $O(\sqrt{dT})$, optimal when the average delay is close to the maximal delay ($\bar{d} \approx d$). Additionally, the paper presents various regret bounds for different settings, including $O(\sqrt{n} T^{3/4} + \sqrt{d T})$ for general cases and improved bounds for strongly convex functions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a valuable algorithm that enhances known regret bounds for delayed BCO.
- The writing style is excellent, with a thorough literature review that effectively situates the research within existing studies.
- The methodology, particularly the blocking update mechanism, is innovative and could inspire further research in similar contexts.
- The theoretical results are logically sound and well-supported, avoiding logical inconsistencies.

Weaknesses:
- The clarity of the paper could be improved; some concepts in the introduction are only clear after reading the entire paper.
- The proofs are difficult to follow, and additional explanations before each lemma would aid comprehension.
- The contribution of the work may be limited, as the improvements are primarily applicable under specific conditions regarding the relationship between maximum and average delays.
- The paper lacks numerical experiments, which would enhance its practical relevance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by refining the introduction and providing clearer explanations of key concepts. Additionally, including more detailed explanations before each lemma would facilitate understanding of the proofs. To strengthen the contribution, the authors should emphasize the specific conditions under which their algorithm improves delayed feedback results. Finally, we suggest incorporating numerical experiments to demonstrate the practical implications of the proposed algorithm and its performance in real-world scenarios.
