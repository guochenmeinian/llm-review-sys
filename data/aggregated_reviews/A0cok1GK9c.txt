Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for distributional regression that learns kernel embeddings through maximizing quantum entropy. The authors propose a novel learning objective that minimizes variance within distributions while maximizing inter-distribution variance, aiming for better separability. Empirical results indicate the method's potential, particularly in distributional classification tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and organized, with clear mathematical notation and a comprehensive exposition of the methodology.
2. The theoretical framework is concise and provides a solid motivation for the proposed approach.
3. The method shows promising results in empirical evaluations, particularly with SVM on specific datasets.

Weaknesses:
1. The empirical evaluation is limited, focusing on only two small datasets, which raises concerns about the generalizability of the results.
2. The unsupervised pretraining method lacks rigor, as it utilizes the entire dataset rather than a training subset, which may affect performance.
3. There is insufficient exploration of regression analysis, with no empirical evaluation provided for regression tasks, limiting the applicability of the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical evaluation by including larger datasets and additional real-world applications beyond the flow cytometry task. It would be beneficial to conduct ablation studies to analyze the impact of hyperparameter selection and provide a direct comparison with existing kernel methods. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the rationale for embedding into a sphere and discussing the computational cost and scalability of the proposed method in more detail. Finally, addressing the concerns regarding the validity of the unsupervised pretraining approach and providing empirical evaluations for regression tasks would strengthen the paper significantly.
