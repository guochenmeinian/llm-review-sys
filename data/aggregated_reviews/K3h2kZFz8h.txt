Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a rigorous theoretical analysis of multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL), focusing on the expressiveness of utility functions and user preferences. The authors propose that common utility function conditions, such as monotonicity and differentiability, are insufficient for guaranteeing optimality, supported by counterexamples. A significant contribution is the identification of conditions under which utility optimal policies exist, specifically through decomposable utility functions of the form h(g(x)), where g is an affine function. Additionally, the paper explores quasi-representative preference relations that facilitate the identification of u-optimality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, clearly identifying and motivating the problems addressed, and providing simple counterexamples.
- The study of multi-objective RL is highly relevant, and the authors effectively articulate the challenges and observations related to utility optimality and user preferences.
- The findings regarding decomposable utility functions and quasi-representative preferences are significant contributions to the field.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a discussion on practical settings where decomposable affine functions or quasi-representative preferences are commonly observed, which would enhance clarity.
- The sufficiency and completeness of the identified conditions for utility optimality and quasi-representative preferences remain unclear and require further elaboration.
- There is insufficient engagement with existing literature on MORL, and some results may not be novel, as they echo prior findings without adequate comparison.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including a section that discusses real-world examples where decomposable utility functions and quasi-representative preferences are applicable. Additionally, clarify whether the identified conditions are sufficient or complete for optimality, particularly regarding quasi-representative preferences. A related work section should be added to contextualize the findings within existing literature, and the authors should consider discussing how their theoretical results could inform the design of novel MORL algorithms. Finally, we suggest providing a more detailed proof of Theorem 2 to enhance clarity and rigor.
