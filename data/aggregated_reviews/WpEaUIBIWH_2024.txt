Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents UniCAD, a unified framework for unsupervised anomaly detection that integrates representation learning, clustering, and anomaly detection. The authors propose a probabilistic mixture model utilizing a Student's-t distribution for robust representation learning and clustering, alongside an anomaly-aware data likelihood objective. Additionally, they introduce a gravity-inspired anomaly scoring method that captures relationships between samples and clusters. Experimental results demonstrate that UniCAD outperforms existing methods in terms of AUC-ROC and AUC-PR across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of representation learning, clustering, and anomaly detection is highly relevant and well-motivated, showcasing their interrelation.
- The paper is well-written, with clear hypotheses and methodologies, supported by impressive experimental results.
- The iterative optimization process using EM is effective and convergent, enhancing the robustness of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- The ablation study on hyperparameters $k$ and $l$ is limited, relying on a single dataset. A broader analysis across multiple datasets is necessary to understand their impact on model performance.
- The importance of the $g(\Theta)$ term introduced in Equation 15 is not adequately discussed, leaving questions about its effect on performance and the implementation of the autoencoder.
- The paper lacks comparisons with other deep anomaly detection methods, which could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of UniCAD's performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the ablation study by including results across all 30 datasets or at least a representative subset to better illustrate the effects of hyperparameters $k$ and $l$. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a detailed discussion on the significance of the $g(\Theta)$ term and its impact on model performance, as well as clarify the implementation of the autoencoder. Finally, we encourage the authors to include comparisons with other state-of-the-art deep anomaly detection methods to strengthen the evaluation of UniCAD.
