### Key Points
This paper presents GFNSeqEditor, a novel sequence editing and generation model based on GFlowNet, aimed at enhancing biological properties by modifying sub-optimal sites in input sequences. The authors provide a theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrating the model's ability to control the number of edits through hyperparameter adjustments. The algorithm shows promise in improving biological properties while minimizing edits for safety and predictability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The introduction of a new biological sequence editing method leveraging GFlowNet is commendable, with robust theoretical analysis and insights into hyperparameter influence on performance.  
- The versatility of GFNSeqEditor is highlighted through examples of sequence generation and length reduction, suggesting broader applications in synthetic biology.  

Weaknesses:  
- The model comparison is inadequate, lacking comparisons with existing biological sequence design methods, which raises questions about its effectiveness.  
- The assumption that fewer edits lead to safer modifications is not thoroughly justified, and the selection criteria for non-AMP samples are unclear, potentially introducing bias.  
- Performance improvements over baseline models are not substantial, particularly regarding editing percentage, and the statistical significance of these improvements is not adequately addressed.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the model comparison by including existing biological sequence design methods, such as AdaLead, PEX, Coms, and BiB, to demonstrate the advantages of GFNSeqEditor. Additionally, we suggest refining the claim regarding the safety of fewer edits and consider including follow-up analysis on structural changes caused by sequence editing. Clarifying the criteria for selecting non-AMP samples would enhance the validity of the results. Finally, including statistical analysis or exploring possible reasons for the observed performance improvements would provide clearer insights into the significance of this work.
