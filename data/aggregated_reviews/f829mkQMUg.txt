Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a nadir point estimation method for evolutionary multi-objective optimization, named BDNE, which decomposes the multi-objective problem (MOP) into boundary subproblems and employs a bilevel architecture for optimization. Theoretical analysis and empirical results indicate the method's effectiveness. The authors model the task of computing the nadir objective vector as several bilevel optimization problems, demonstrating that BDNE can outperform existing heuristic methods. Additionally, the paper provides a detailed analysis of trade-offs in the BDNE method, specifically focusing on the parameters $\tau_u$ and $\mu$. The authors show that increasing $\tau_u$ enhances accuracy while decreasing runtime, and that a smaller $\mu$ leads to a more refined promising region for Pareto-optimal solutions. However, the practical significance of an exact nadir point remains underexplored, and the empirical study lacks comprehensiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces a novel method for nadir point specification, differing from past approaches, and provides mathematical properties of the proposed method.  
- The empirical study highlights the effectiveness of BDNE, showing it can determine the nadir point more accurately than baseline methods.  
- The authors provide clear experimental results illustrating the impact of parameters $\tau_u$ and $\mu$ on accuracy and runtime.  
- The theoretical analysis and illustrative examples effectively validate the proposed method's advantages over existing heuristics.  
- The work is well-organized, with clear examples and theoretical guarantees for the proposed method.  
- The response to reviewer concerns has been thorough, leading to increased scores from multiple reviewers.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper is poorly written, particularly in Sections 3 and 3.1, where the introduction of boundary subproblems lacks motivation and clarity.  
- The empirical study does not sufficiently demonstrate the significance of BDNE in improving multi-objective algorithms (MOAs), focusing only on accuracy without addressing practical implications.  
- The experimental design raises questions regarding the selection of test problems and the computational resources used, with concerns about the high number of function evaluations required.  
- The empirical study lacks comprehensiveness, with only two baselines from seven years ago presented, and there is a need for a more extensive comparison with current methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Sections 3 and 3.1 by providing motivation for the boundary subproblem and explaining the relevance of the proposed dominance relation and its properties. Additionally, the authors should consider using illustrations to clarify new concepts such as boundary subproblems and cone-domination. Merging tables that present experimental data for baseline and BDNE would enhance data comparison. Furthermore, the authors should address the practical significance of an accurate nadir point in relation to MOAs, demonstrating how BDNE can improve algorithm performance beyond mere accuracy. A more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of BDNE and the rationale behind the selection of test problems would strengthen the empirical study. Lastly, incorporating a broader range of strong baselines and additional test problems, as well as conducting an ablation study to explore how BDNE enhances the performance of MOAs in practical scenarios, would be beneficial. A detailed summary of the advantages and weaknesses of the proposed method compared to existing ones should also be included to underscore the paper's significance and positioning.
