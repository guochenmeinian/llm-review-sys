### Key Points
This paper presents OneStream and MultiStream, two novel algorithms for solving the Submodular Maximization with Knapsack Constraint (SMKC) problem in streaming settings. The authors propose these algorithms to achieve linear time complexity without relying on restrictive assumptions, demonstrating their efficiency and memory usage through experimental results in two real-world applications. The work addresses a critical bottleneck in scalable data stream processing by combining practicality with strong theoretical guarantees.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The algorithms offer a novel approach to the SMKC problem without restrictive assumptions, marking a unique contribution to the field.  
2. OneStream and MultiStream significantly reduce computational and memory costs compared to existing methods.  
3. The theoretical analysis is comprehensive and well-developed, providing provable approximation ratios.  
4. The manuscript is well-organized and clearly written, enhancing readability.

Weaknesses:  
1. The experimental datasets are relatively small and do not reflect large-scale real-world data, limiting the generalizability of the results.  
2. The theoretical insights may be complex and not easily understood by a broader audience.  
3. The choice of baselines is limited; additional comparisons with recent, specialized streaming algorithms could strengthen the findings.  
4. The introduction of certain concepts, such as $e^*$ in Algorithm 1, is confusing and requires clearer explanations.  
5. The paper does not adequately address the implications of the monotonicity assumption of the utility function and its relevance to real-world applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental design by testing the algorithms on larger and more diverse datasets to enhance the robustness of their findings. Additionally, we encourage the authors to include comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, such as Distributed Clustering of Linear Bandits in Peer to Peer Networks and Fast Distributed Bandits for Online Recommendation Systems, to better contextualize their results. Clarifying the role of $e^*$ in Algorithm 1 and discussing the implications of the monotonicity assumption on real-world applications would also strengthen the paper. Furthermore, a detailed investigation into how variations in parameters like $h$ and $\epsilon$ affect performance is essential. Lastly, addressing typographical errors and providing visual aids for complex theoretical insights would enhance clarity and comprehension.
