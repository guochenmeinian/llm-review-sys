### Key Points
This paper presents a bio-inspired framework that optimizes scan paths for image classification using a transformer-based memory module combined with reinforcement learning. The authors empirically evaluate their approach on the MNIST and cluttered MNIST datasets, comparing it against vision transformers, CNNs, and a recurrent model of visual attention. The results indicate that the proposed framework offers some explainability in classification outcomes and draws inspiration from biological attention processes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The methodology for emulating sequential attention through vision transformers and reinforcement learning is innovative.  
- The experimental design is robust, testing significant aspects of the work and yielding interesting results.  
- The paper is well-written and provides a fair comparison with existing approaches, highlighting the novelty of the authors' contribution.  

Weaknesses:  
- The use of MNIST variants, which are less complex than natural images, raises questions about the model's performance on more challenging datasets like ImageNet or CIFAR-10.  
- It is unclear whether the model can handle varying input resolutions effectively.  
- The experiments rely on a single data split, which does not quantify confidence thresholds for error estimates, leading to concerns about the robustness of the findings. Additionally, only classification error is reported as a metric.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their specific contributions, as some components appear to be derived from RAM or Dosovitskiy et al. This will enhance the understanding of the novelty in their work. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors expand their experimental evaluation to include more complex natural images to better assess the model's performance. Additionally, addressing the robustness of the model to different input resolutions and providing multiple data splits for error estimation would strengthen the findings. Finally, we encourage the authors to consider shifting the focus of the paper towards interpretability, as the debate on achieving superior performance compared to RAM remains unresolved.
