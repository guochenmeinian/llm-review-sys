Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents GeNIe, a data augmentation method utilizing text-to-image latent diffusion models to generate hard negative images by modifying source images with target category prompts. The authors propose an adaptive noise-scaling algorithm to optimize the modification extent for each image, demonstrating the method's effectiveness in few-shot and long-tailed classification tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, clearly articulating the core idea of generating hard-negative images through intuitive modifications.
- The adaptive noise-level determination algorithm is effective and eliminates hyperparameter dependence, with potential connections to recent phase-transition research in diffusion models.
- Comprehensive evaluations against various baselines and traditional augmentations showcase the method's effectiveness.
- The paper includes extensive experiments and visualizations, illustrating the adaptive search procedure's success.

Weaknesses:
- Results indicate that Text2Image, GeNIe, and GeNIe-Ada perform comparably, suggesting that gains may stem from increased distinct examples rather than hard negatives.
- Beyond a certain threshold, augmentations similar to the source image yield comparable performance, questioning the necessity of hard negatives.
- The GeNIe-Ada algorithm is compute-intensive, potentially limiting its efficiency compared to simpler methods like Text2Image.
- The applicability of GeNIe is primarily in the fine-tuning stage rather than pretraining.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the effectiveness of GeNIe when applied to a larger number of classes and elaborate on the use of the confusion matrix for selecting source images. Additionally, consider exploring how modifications appear when source and target classes are semantically incompatible. It may also be beneficial to provide examples of failure cases for Algorithm 1. Finally, we suggest addressing the sensitivity of the noise ratio \( r \) to different datasets and exploring the potential of using smaller or alternative latent diffusion models for similar benefits.
