### Key Points
This paper presents the application of machine learning (ML), particularly deep neural networks (DNNs), to forecast the droplet formation process by utilizing auto-conversion rates derived from simulated and satellite data. The authors propose an evidential regression approach to estimate the model's predictive uncertainty. The study demonstrates promising results using three ICON simulation datasets and satellite observations from MODIS. As an application paper, it effectively integrates AI/ML techniques in environmental and earth sciences, is well-motivated, and clearly structured, supported by several experimental results. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Addresses a real scientific problem by applying ML/NNs to support simulations.
- Utilizes real-world datasets.
- Considers the model's predictive uncertainty.
- Shows promising forecasting results.

Weaknesses:
- Lacks detailed comparison of computing times and costs between ML models and simulations.
- Does not compare uncertainty estimation to any baseline, despite the appendix containing baseline models for accuracy.
- Limited comparison to previous work, such as Novitasari et al. 2021.
- Minor typos and modifications needed, including corrections in Figure 2's caption and ensuring all reference information is complete.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the versatility of the experiments by including a detailed analysis of computing time and costs between ML models and simulations. Additionally, we suggest incorporating a baseline for comparing the usefulness of uncertainty estimation with the evidential model. It would also be beneficial to enhance the introduction by adding references to other probabilistic forecasting models, such as the one found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10422. Lastly, please correct the caption for Figure 2 to reflect the prediction results obtained from the NN model and ensure all reference information is complete.
