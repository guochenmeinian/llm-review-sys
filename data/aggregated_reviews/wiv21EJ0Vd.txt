Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents RECODE, a novel method for zero-shot visual relation detection (VRD) that addresses the limitations of traditional class-based prompts by decomposing visual features into subject, object, and spatial components. The authors leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate description-based prompts for each component, enhancing the discriminability of similar relation categories. The method also introduces a chain-of-thought (CoT) approach to assign reasonable weights to different visual cues. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of the proposed framework. Additionally, the authors propose two coding approaches for visual relation classification: one utilizing CoT reasoning and another without it, exploring visual cue generation through structured prompts that detail the relationships between subjects and objects in various contexts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The framework for decomposing visual cues and using LLMs to generate prompts for subject, object, and spatial features is novel.
- The proposed method shows noticeable performance improvements over baseline methods, supported by ablation studies.
- The authors provide a clear framework for visual relation classification, demonstrating the importance of visual features in determining predicates.
- The paper is well-written, with clear descriptions and extensive experimental results that enhance understanding.
- The detailed coding examples illustrate the application of the proposed methods effectively.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation section lacks important baselines, as it primarily compares the proposed model with simplified versions, resembling an ablation study rather than a comprehensive evaluation against state-of-the-art methods.
- The improvements made to the prompts are relatively straightforward, and the use of CoT is a standard practice, raising questions about the technical novelty.
- There is insufficient analysis of failure cases and a lack of discussion on the limitations of the proposed approach, particularly regarding the reliability of LLMs and the quality of visual cues.
- The paper initially received negative feedback due to insufficient clarification of technical details and lack of motivation and experimental performance presentation.
- Readers may find the lengthy discussions required to grasp the core ideas unfriendly, particularly within the community context.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation section by including comparisons with recent state-of-the-art models to validate the effectiveness of RECODE. Additionally, the authors should provide more empirical evidence supporting the benefits of the proposed method, including clearer explanations of the visual cues used in experiments. A thorough analysis of failure cases and a dedicated section discussing the limitations of the proposed approach would strengthen the paper. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to enhance the clarity of technical details and improve the presentation of motivation and experimental performance. Finally, clarifying the criteria for selecting visual cues and discussing their impact on performance would enhance the overall understanding of the method.
