Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an INR-based video compression framework, Neural Video Representation Compression (NVRC), which targets the compression of implicit representations. The authors propose novel entropy coding and quantization models, enabling end-to-end optimization of the INR-based codec. They also introduce a hierarchical model compression framework for coding network parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that NVRC achieves a 24% coding gain over VTM (Random Access) on the UVG dataset, measured in PSNR.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The manuscript is well-written and easy to follow.  
- The proposed framework exhibits novelty by establishing an efficient dependency among grid parameters, neural network parameters, and hyperpriors.  
- NVRC shows outstanding rate-distortion performance, surpassing VTM.  

Weaknesses:  
- Evaluation is limited to the UVG dataset; broader dataset usage is recommended.  
- The paper does not adequately address existing works on joint rate-distortion optimization for INR-based compression, which should be discussed.  
- Complexity comparisons in Table 2 lack references to previous methods.  
- Components used in the paper have precedents in prior works, necessitating a discussion of their novelty.  
- Encoding time is significantly slower than real-time, raising concerns for practical applications.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including additional datasets such as MCL-JCV, HEVC B, HEVC C, HEVC D, HEVC E, and HEVC RGB to strengthen the generalizability of their results. Additionally, the authors should clarify the differences between their work and existing literature on joint rate-distortion optimization, particularly addressing the challenges specific to video compression. We suggest enhancing the complexity comparisons in Table 2 with references to previous methods and discussing the novelty of each component in relation to prior works. Finally, the authors should provide detailed encoding and decoding times to assess the practicality of NVRC for real-time applications.
