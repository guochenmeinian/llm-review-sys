### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the popularity bias problem in LLM-based recommender systems, highlighting its significance given the increasing use of LLMs. The authors propose a new metric for evaluating popularity bias, revealing that LLM-based recommendations exhibit less popularity bias compared to traditional systems. The paper also discusses the nuances of measuring popularity bias, contrasting common assumptions with empirical data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses relevant issues in recommender systems, particularly the interplay between popularity and LLMs.  
- It provides interesting insights into the popularity bias of LLM-generated recommendations, challenging existing assumptions.  
- The writing is clear and accessible, making complex ideas easier to understand.  

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty of the popularity bias metrics discussed is limited, as some have been previously established in the literature.  
- The comparison between LLM-based and traditional recommender systems relies on simple versions, raising questions about the reliability of the conclusions.  
- The empirical data may not fully align with the idealized assumptions of power-law distributions, and the choice of dataset could be reconsidered.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the robustness of their findings by conducting more comprehensive experiments with additional baselines and datasets. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the choice of using a subsample of 10M instead of the MovieLens 1M dataset. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore more novel metrics for measuring popularity bias to enhance the originality of their contributions.
