Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for producing simple "blocks world" 3D geometry from posed RGB images, focusing on a collection of superquadric blobs as a 3D representation. The main technical contribution is the adaptation of differentiable rendering techniques to support transparency in superquadrics. Experiments demonstrate the method's ability to fit scenes with multiple sub-objects, although the quality of reconstruction is limited by the number of superquadrics used, typically around 10. The paper emphasizes that while the approach is not aimed at photorealistic reconstruction, it still faces criticism regarding the realism of its outputs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of core concepts and relevant related work discussed in detail.
- The optimization-based approach is appealing, as it does not rely on learned priors and can theoretically apply to any image collection.
- The introduction of transparency in primitives and the adaptation of soft rasterization techniques are novel contributions that may have broader applications.

Weaknesses:
- The quality of the fits is coarse, particularly for complex shapes, and the method is criticized for being unrealistic, as it often fails to capture fine geometric details.
- The choice of using a limited number of superquadrics raises questions about the method's ability to represent more complex scenes effectively.
- The paper lacks exploration of standard optimization techniques like coarse-to-fine optimization or primitive splitting, which could mitigate issues with local minima.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity around the choice of K=10 for the number of superquadrics and explore the implications of using larger values such as K=100 or K=1000. Additionally, we suggest including a more detailed analysis of why the model gets caught in bad local minima and whether increasing the number of restarts could help avoid these minima. It would also be beneficial to adjust parameters like sigma of the soft rasterization during optimization and to investigate the effects of varying the parsimony parameter through ablation studies. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide comparisons with state-of-the-art methods in multi-view stereo reconstruction and to report running times for their method and baselines to enhance the evaluation of their approach.
