### Key Points
This paper presents Diagonal Attention Pooling (Ditto), an unsupervised method aimed at enhancing sentence embeddings by addressing the bias towards uninformative words in BERT outputs. The authors analyze the differences between BERT and SBERT embeddings and demonstrate that Ditto improves performance on semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks without requiring additional training or fine-tuning. The method is well-motivated by the relationship between attention mechanism diagonal entries and TF-IDF weights.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a clear motivation for the proposed method and demonstrates solid empirical results.
- The analysis of sentence embeddings from multiple perspectives is impressive and visually illustrated.
- Ditto is easy to implement and does not require changes to the original model's parameters.

Weaknesses:
- The conclusion regarding the alleviation of the anisotropy problem lacks sufficient support, as it relies on limited metrics.
- The correspondence between the proposed methods and initial observations needs further clarification.
- Ditto's applicability is limited, as it cannot be used with methods like SimCSE that utilize [CLS] for embeddings.
- Potential drawbacks of relying on TF-IDF weights may introduce issues into the resulting sentence representations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the support for their conclusion on alleviating the anisotropy problem by incorporating additional metrics or comparisons with other methods. Clarifying the relationship between the proposed methods and the initial observations would strengthen the paper. Additionally, addressing the limitations of Ditto's applicability and discussing prior work on learning-free or parameter-free postprocessing for sentence embeddings would enhance the depth of the analysis. Finally, considering alternative approaches, such as concatenating embeddings from different layers, may yield better results.
