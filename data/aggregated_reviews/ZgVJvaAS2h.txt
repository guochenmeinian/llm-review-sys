Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework for diffusion-based image restoration, integrating an initial deterministic predictor with a probabilistic diffusion denoising network to refine image quality. The authors propose a new inter-step patch-splitting procedure to enhance high-resolution restoration and utilize basis convolutional kernels for spatially variant convolutions in the denoiser. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements in perceptual metrics across various datasets, including SID for low-light denoising, GoPro for motion deblurring, and ImageNet for JPEG compression artifact restoration.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The framework achieves promising performance across multiple restoration tasks, demonstrating versatility in handling various degradations.
- The use of basis kernels for spatially-variant convolutions is innovative and adds depth to the methodology.
- The inter-step patch-splitting strategy effectively addresses high-resolution image generation without grid artifacts.
- Experimental results show substantial improvements in perceptual quality metrics.

Weaknesses:
- The technical novelty is limited, as many components are derived from existing methods, and the performance gains from new components are not significant.
- The paper lacks clarity in several areas, including the representation of auxiliary information and the details of the inter-step patch-splitting procedure.
- There are discrepancies in the reported NIQE metrics compared to prior work, which require justification.
- The paper contains numerous spelling errors, indicating a lack of thorough proofreading.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing detailed explanations of how auxiliary scalar information is represented and clarifying the inter-step patch-splitting procedure. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments with DvSR on low-light denoising and JPEG restoration tasks to validate the proposed method's effectiveness. The authors should also address the discrepancies in the NIQE metrics and provide a thorough justification for any differences. Finally, we advise running a spell-checker to correct the numerous spelling errors throughout the manuscript.
