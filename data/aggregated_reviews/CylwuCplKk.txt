Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a robust aggregation problem involving both truthful and adversarial experts, focusing on binary states. The authors propose optimal aggregators for minimizing regret under L1 and L2 losses, demonstrating that the k-truncated mean is optimal for L1 loss, while a piecewise linear function serves as the optimal aggregator for L2 loss. The paper includes theoretical analyses and numerical experiments on ensemble learning tasks, validating the proposed models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper provides a comprehensive theoretical analysis and rigorous proofs, enhancing the validity of its conclusions.
2. It introduces a novel problem setting by considering adversarial experts, significantly extending the scope of robust information aggregation research.
3. Empirical validation through numerical experiments demonstrates the practical applicability of the proposed aggregators.

Weaknesses:
1. The main body of the article is only seven pages long, which is insufficient for a self-contained paper.
2. The experimental baselines are simplistic, limited to voting and averaging, without discussing more advanced algorithms applicable to ensemble learning.
3. The extension to multi-state cases is not addressed, which is crucial for understanding the implications of the theory.
4. Some sections, particularly proofs in the appendices, may be challenging for readers lacking a strong theoretical background.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization of the content, particularly by including examples in Sections 1 and 3 to enhance readability. Additionally, we suggest discussing the performance of the majority vote aggregator in relation to the optimal aggregators for L1 loss, especially when k is large. Furthermore, we advise including a discussion on the extension to multi-state cases and exploring the adaptation of more advanced algorithms for experimental comparisons. Lastly, we encourage the authors to address the overly lengthy formulas to improve clarity.
