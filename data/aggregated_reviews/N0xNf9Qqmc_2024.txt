Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for zero-shot semantic image segmentation utilizing features from a pre-trained diffusion model. The authors propose a recursive normalized cut algorithm to cluster features extracted from the U-Net of the diffusion model, achieving improved segmentation performance across standard benchmarks. The method demonstrates significant advancements over existing techniques, particularly in unsupervised and open-vocabulary settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper makes a targeted contribution by integrating an off-the-shelf feature extractor with a clustering algorithm and a novel upscaling method, evaluated against standard benchmarks for clear comparisons.
- The proposed model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, supported by comprehensive ablation studies.
- The writing is clear, and the structure facilitates understanding of the main contributions.

Weaknesses:
- The paper claims improvements over TokenCut and MaskCut but lacks direct experimental comparisons with these models.
- The experimental setup appears biased, as the proposed method uses a more powerful distilled SD-XL model compared to baselines using SD1.4, raising concerns about fairness in comparisons.
- The writing lacks clarity in certain areas, such as the definition of "semantic segmentation" and the computational efficiency of the proposed method.
- The evaluation does not adequately address the model's performance in unsupervised instance or panoptic segmentation tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by explicitly stating that it targets semantic segmentation to avoid confusion. Additionally, a direct comparison of segmentation results from different base models, including runtime metrics, would enhance the analysis. It would be beneficial to include evaluations using the SD1.4 model for a fairer comparison with previous methods. We also suggest providing visual examples to illustrate concepts like "patch-level alignment" and discussing the potential limitations regarding the model's performance on small-scale objects. Lastly, a more comprehensive discussion on the evaluation strategy, particularly concerning the Hungarian matching algorithm, would strengthen the paper's arguments.
