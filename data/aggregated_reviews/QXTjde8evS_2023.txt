Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel sampling method in diffusion-based models for generating large synthetic whole slide images (WSIs) in digital pathology. The authors propose a scalable hierarchical diffusion model, 'DiffInfinite', which generates images while maintaining long-range structural correlations and avoiding artifacts. The framework first generates synthetic segmentation masks that guide the final image generation, resulting in fine-grained details. The authors validate their approach through expert pathologist surveys and comprehensive evaluations on both classification and segmentation tasks, demonstrating improvements in generalization when synthetic data supplements real data. Additionally, the authors emphasize their technical contributions, including a publicly available codebase that allows for efficient generation of unique datapoints with flexibility in resolution and spatial distribution.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed framework effectively generates large synthetic tissue images and segmentation masks, addressing the challenges of synthetic image generation in histopathology.
- Innovative sampling and generation techniques provide greater flexibility and quality in the generated images, avoiding issues of memorization and artifacts.
- Extensive evaluations, including expert pathologist feedback and various fidelity metrics, support the credibility and quality of the generated images.
- The significance of synthetic WSIs is well recognized, particularly in light of the challenges and costs associated with acquiring real images.

Weaknesses:
- The lack of access to the model and dataset during the review process limits the ability to fully assess the claims regarding the model's performance and generalization.
- The evaluation of the downstream segmentation task lacks clarity, with no baseline comparisons provided, making it difficult to gauge the significance of the reported F1 score.
- The model architecture description is somewhat confusing, relying heavily on citations rather than providing a thorough explanation.
- Some reviewers expressed concerns about the relevance of the work to the Datasets & Benchmarks track, and clarity regarding downstream tasks was initially lacking.
- The training dataset size was questioned, with suggestions for including more diverse whole slide images.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the model architecture description by providing a more detailed overview and a comprehensive diagram illustrating the training and data flow. Additionally, we suggest that the authors conduct a patch-level classification evaluation to better assess the utility of the generated synthetic images in downstream tasks. Providing access to the model and generated samples during the review process would enhance transparency and allow for more thorough evaluation. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the manuscript regarding the relevance to the Datasets & Benchmarks track by explicitly linking their contributions to the call for papers. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to continue to enhance the description of downstream tasks and provide further details on the experiments conducted. Finally, expanding their training dataset to include a broader range of whole slide images would strengthen their model's applicability and robustness, as well as addressing the potential for misuse of generated images in medical contexts to strengthen the ethical considerations of the work.
