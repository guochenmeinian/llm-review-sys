### Key Points
This paper presents a new gender bias metric called Gender Score for the image captioning task, exploring the use of cosine distance to measure gender bias. The authors propose that Gender Score performs better than the prior Object Gender Co-Occ metric. The paper investigates the relationship between objects and gender bias in captions, introducing a visual semantic-based gender score that can be integrated into existing systems for improved bias evaluation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant issue of gender bias in image captioning, particularly with gender-specific objects.
- The introduction of the visual semantic-based gender score is a novel and practical contribution for measuring gender bias.
- The proposed metric demonstrates effectiveness in evaluating the bias relationship between captions and gender.

Weaknesses:
- The main body of the paper is too short, lacking important elements such as a framework diagram and formal mathematical expressions.
- Some tables have small font sizes and poor formatting, affecting readability.
- The comparison of Gender Score is limited to cosine distance, without exploring more suitable or updated methods, which weakens its credibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the comparison between Gender Score and Object Gender Co-Occ by detailing specific scenarios for their use. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion section that addresses the limitations of studying gender as a binary category and the implications of automatic gender classification. The authors should also enhance the presentation of results by adjusting font sizes and formatting in tables for better readability. Finally, incorporating a broader range of comparison methods would strengthen the paper's claims.
