Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a metric flow matching algorithm that minimizes the kinetic energy of a data-induced Riemannian metric to address the trajectory inference problem, particularly in single-cell trajectory prediction. The authors propose a method where interpolated distributions lie on the data manifold, enhancing the interpretability of flow matching trajectories. The approach builds on conditional flow matching (CFM) and incorporates optimal transport concepts to improve the sampling distribution for trajectory optimization. Additionally, the authors introduce a framework for learning a metric that facilitates trajectory inference in single-cell RNA data and other applications, using a non-linear dimensionality reduction approach on the top principal components without explicitly parameterizing a lower-dimensional manifold. They clarify that their method, MFM, employs a data-dependent Riemannian metric for flow matching, distinguishing itself by its specific application of this metric. The authors address discrepancies in FID scores between their method and others, attributing differences to variations in experimental setups, such as the use of different latent spaces and image resolutions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and effectively communicates complex ideas, making it accessible.  
- It addresses a significant problem in flow matching, providing an original contribution to the generative modeling community.  
- The authors provide a clear rationale for their choice of metric and its application in trajectory inference tasks.  
- The experiments demonstrate improved performance in single-cell trajectory prediction compared to non-metric flow matching baselines.  
- The rebuttal includes additional visualizations and clarifications that enhance the clarity of the paper.  
- The approach of using a data-dependent metric in flow matching is well-articulated and demonstrates potential applicability across tasks.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks clarity in certain areas, particularly regarding the choice of metrics and their implications.  
- The novelty of the contributions is questioned, as much of the foundational work has been previously established.  
- Some experimental setups and results are poorly justified or unclear, raising concerns about the robustness of the findings.  
- The terminology used in the paper is sometimes vague, leading to confusion regarding key concepts like "more meaningful matching."  
- The reported FID values raise skepticism, as they are significantly higher than those reported by other methods in the literature.  
- The authors do not adequately address concerns regarding the effectiveness of the interpolant when optimal coupling is not used, particularly for multimodal data distributions.  
- Some terminology, such as "not defined," lacks clarity and may confuse readers.  
- The authors do not fully address concerns regarding the reproducibility of results, particularly in the LiDAR experiment.  
- There is a lack of explicit comparisons with other potential metrics, which could strengthen their claims.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their exposition, particularly in defining key terms such as "matching" and justifying the choice of diagonal metrics. It is essential to explicitly compare their approach with existing methods, particularly in terms of novelty and applicability beyond single-cell dynamics. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide more detailed discussions on the impact of using L2 distance for \( c(x,y) \) and address the implications of the choice of coupling \( q \) on the trajectory results. Clarifying the experimental setups, particularly in the LiDAR and AFHQ experiments, and providing direct comparisons with existing works would strengthen the empirical validation of their claims. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their terminology, particularly regarding "more meaningful matching," to ensure that readers fully understand its implications. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors provide a more thorough comparison of their FID values against existing works to substantiate their claims. It would be beneficial to address the concerns regarding the effectiveness of the interpolant in multimodal scenarios more explicitly. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify how their method relates to the manifold hypothesis, particularly in terms of maintaining proximity to the underlying manifold during interpolation tasks, and to provide a more thorough discussion on the reproducibility of results in the LiDAR experiment, potentially including comparisons with GSBM to enhance the robustness of their claims.
