### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to qualitative annotation through a user-centric model that provides automated code suggestions, facilitating collaboration between human annotators and machines. The authors introduce the Quoding dataset, the only open-source dataset for qualitative coding tasks, and propose a conceptual task model that emphasizes aspects like data saturation and rare codes. The evaluation includes both automated experiments and human subject studies, demonstrating the potential of their approach to assist annotators.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a comprehensive study with a well-defined conceptual task model for qualitative coding.
- The introduction of the Quoding dataset is a significant contribution that can drive future research.
- Detailed experiments and analyses reinforce the proposed task model and demonstrate the effectiveness of the qualitative coding suggestion models.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks sufficient context regarding existing work, failing to adequately situate itself within the literature on human-in-the-loop annotation.
- The objectives of the user study are unclear, particularly regarding the specific research questions being addressed.
- Some sections, such as the workflow, are difficult to follow, and the presentation could be improved for clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section to better differentiate their approach from existing studies, particularly those on human-in-the-loop annotation. Clarifying the objectives of the user study and specifying the research questions would enhance the paper's rigor. Additionally, we suggest including a diagram to illustrate the overall workflow of the method for better comprehension. The authors should also consider moving Table 1 to the appendix for conciseness and ensuring that scatterplots from Appendix A.7 are presented in the main paper with adequate detail. Finally, we encourage the authors to streamline discussions in Sections 5.3 and 6.1 to avoid redundancy and enhance readability.
