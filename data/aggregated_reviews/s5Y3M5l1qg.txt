Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel adversarial defense mechanism called CARSO, which integrates adversarial training and purification to enhance robustness in image classification. CARSO consists of a classifier and a purifier, where the classifier is pretrained to classify potentially perturbed data, and the purifier generates a latent space from the classifier's internal representation and the original input. The final prediction is made by aggregating outputs from the classifier for reconstructed data. The method is validated across multiple datasets, achieving robust accuracy that surpasses state-of-the-art models. Additionally, the authors propose using the WideResNet-28-10 classifier architecture, which is widely adopted in the field, and provide empirical evidence of superior performance in terms of $\ell_{\infty}$ robust accuracy compared to a variety of models. They acknowledge the need for broader experimental scope, including higher resolution datasets, and address the effectiveness of their method through comparisons with existing adversarially trained models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The concept of blending adversarial training and purification is novel and interesting.  
- CARSO demonstrates robust accuracy exceeding that of existing adversarially trained models and purification methods.  
- The evaluation is thorough, addressing common pitfalls in robustness evaluation, including end-to-end validation and gradient obfuscation.  
- The use of a widely accepted classifier architecture enhances the relevance of their findings.  
- The authors provide empirical evidence of their method's effectiveness, showing superior robust accuracy.  
- The acknowledgment of the need for broader experimental scope indicates a willingness to improve.

Weaknesses:  
1. The presentation of the paper is poor, with unclear descriptions and a lack of analysis of existing methods.  
2. The experiments are insufficient to convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of CARSO, lacking comparisons with more models and baselines.  
3. The claim that CARSO surpasses existing models is questionable, as the decoder's ability to reconstruct samples relies heavily on the classifier's performance.  
4. The paper lacks a formal ablation study, which could strengthen the assessment of their method's effectiveness.  
5. Concerns regarding the quality of expressions and figures were raised late in the review process, limiting the authors' ability to address them effectively.  
6. The authors do not sufficiently address the implications of using lower resolution datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper's presentation, particularly in Section 4, to enhance the flow of methodology. Additionally, the authors should conduct more comprehensive experiments, including comparisons with a wider range of models and baselines, and consider including formal ablation studies to better assess the effectiveness of their method and clarify the trade-offs involved. It is crucial to clarify the advantages of the proposed method over existing approaches and to address the trade-offs involved in integrating purification with adversarial training. We also suggest that the authors standardize the meaning of symbols used throughout the paper to improve readability. Finally, we encourage the authors to address the quality of expressions and figures earlier in the review process to facilitate timely improvements and to expand their experimental scope by including higher resolution datasets.
