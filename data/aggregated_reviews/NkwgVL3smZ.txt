Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method called NORA (NOde-Removal-based fast GNN inference) to efficiently compute the influence of node removal in graph neural networks (GNNs). The authors propose an approximation technique that reduces the running time complexity from $O(N(LMh+LNh^2))$ to $O(LMh+LNh^2)$, leveraging the gradient of the neural network. The experimental results indicate that NORA achieves a decent approximation of node-removal influence while demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-structured and effectively communicates its methodologies.  
- The technical approach is sound, with NORA showing improved efficiency and performance in several instances.  
- Extensive experiments on six datasets bolster the credibility of the findings.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks a thorough investigation of the approximation error, missing a theoretical error bound and sufficient experimental data to evaluate reliability.  
- The differences between NORA and LARA methods are not clearly delineated, which could confuse readers.  
- The introduction is confusing and does not adequately explain existing problems or motivations.  
- The efficiency of NORA appears limited, as it performs slower than LARA-E in most datasets.  
- The depth of novelty may be questioned, as the concept of measuring node influence is already prevalent in literature.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the investigation of the approximation error by providing a theoretical error bound and additional experimental data to assess reliability. Additionally, the authors should clarify the distinctions between NORA and LARA to guide readers in method selection. We suggest enhancing the introduction to clearly articulate the existing problems and motivations behind the research. Furthermore, the authors should consider verifying the methods on more graph tasks and elaborate on the significance of studying single node removal on model performance. Lastly, it is crucial to address the recent work by Chen et al. to articulate the differences and compare empirical performances, thereby strengthening the paper's novelty and relevance.
