### Key Points
This paper presents a method for machine unlearning, aiming to adjust an existing model to resemble one trained without a specified subset of data. The authors propose a framework called Controllable Machine Unlearning (ConMu), which integrates three tunable modules: a data selection module for faster training, a progressive Gaussian mechanism for enhanced privacy, and an unlearning proxy for fine-tuning. The empirical evaluation assesses the utility, efficiency, and privacy of the proposed unlearning algorithms, demonstrating that ConMu achieves a favorable balance among these metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The algorithm is clearly articulated, with a well-structured explanation of each module's motivation and potential outcomes, effectively summarized in Figure 2.
- The empirical evaluation is comprehensive, comparing multiple algorithms across privacy, utility, and efficiency, providing valuable insights into trade-offs.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity regarding the privacy implications of the progressive Gaussian mechanism, particularly the relationship between the Gaussian noise and the FRM privacy score. Further explanation is needed on how the mechanism theoretically affects this score.
- The empirical analysis is limited to image classification, raising questions about the generalizability of the framework to other data types relevant to the WebConf community.
- The paper does not sufficiently justify why ConMu is superior to existing methods, as some empirical results indicate that other methods outperform it in certain metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the privacy implications of the progressive Gaussian mechanism, specifically clarifying the relationship between their proposed FRM privacy score and differential privacy. Additionally, the authors should consider expanding the empirical analysis to include diverse data modalities beyond image classification to enhance the framework's applicability. It would also be beneficial to provide a theoretical justification for the superiority of ConMu over existing methods, potentially demonstrating a "pareto frontier" along the trade-off dimensions. Lastly, we suggest revising the manuscript for vocabulary clarity and correcting any typographical errors to improve readability.
