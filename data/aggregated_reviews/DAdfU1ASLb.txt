Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach utilizing optimal transport to address selection-bias issues in binary treatment settings for individualized treatment effect estimation. The authors propose a relaxed mass-preserving regularizer to mitigate misalignment caused by outcome imbalance and outliers in non-ideal mini-batches, alongside a proximal factual outcome regularizer to relax the unconfoundedness assumption. Extensive evaluations on the IHDP and ACIC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- A creative method for treatment effect estimation is introduced, leveraging optimal transport principles.
- The paper includes extensive evaluations and necessary analyses, including ablation studies.
- Theoretical results are provided to bound the error concerning the proposed components, demonstrating convergence.

Weaknesses:
- The baselines used are outdated; comparisons with recent treatment effect estimation techniques are lacking.
- The paper does not clarify the terminology related to conditional average treatment effect estimation, which may confuse readers.
- Assumptions underlying the causal inference methods are not explicitly stated.
- Concerns regarding the training duration of networks and the clarity of figures are raised.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with recent techniques in treatment effect estimation to enhance the paper's relevance. Additionally, please clarify the terminology related to conditional average treatment effects to avoid confusion. Clearly stating the assumptions required for the application of the proposed methods is essential. We also suggest addressing the training duration of networks by employing early stopping and ensuring all methods are trained adequately. Lastly, please ensure that figures clearly label axes and reconsider the title to accurately reflect the contribution of the work.
