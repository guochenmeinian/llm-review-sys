Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the SEVILA framework, which integrates a single image-language model (BLIP-2) for both temporal keyframe localization and video question answering. The framework consists of two modules: the Localizer, which identifies language-aware keyframes, and the Answerer, which predicts answers based on these keyframes. The method achieves state-of-the-art results on various video question answering benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The framework effectively leverages image-language models for video-related tasks, addressing the challenge of missing visual cues in video question answering.
- The self-chaining mechanism enhances temporal localization accuracy without requiring expensive annotations.
- Extensive experiments validate the framework's performance, and the paper is well-organized and clearly written.

Weaknesses:
- The improvements over existing methods primarily stem from the use of the BLIP-2 model, with only marginal gains compared to BLIP-2+concat in the finetuning setting.
- The technical contribution is relatively weak, as the idea of keyframe selection is straightforward and previously explored.
- The Localizer's reliance on manual annotations raises questions about its generalizability and potential benefits from weak supervision.
- The self-chaining approach incurs additional computational costs, and the model's limitations in temporal modeling may hinder its performance on tasks sensitive to temporal dependencies.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the differences between their approach and similar models like LGDN in the related work section. Additionally, the authors should provide details on the computational costs associated with the self-chaining approach. To enhance the model's robustness, we suggest exploring the generalizability of the Localizer with other image-language models and considering the incorporation of weak supervision techniques. Lastly, we encourage the authors to investigate the potential benefits of iterative self-refinement between the Localizer and Answerer modules.
