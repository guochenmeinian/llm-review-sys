### Key Points
This paper presents a prefix-tuning method for learning general-purpose text representations that can be efficiently updated for multiple tasks. The authors propose a framework that generates text representations conditioned on multiple source task prefixes, allowing for lightweight models to be trained on unseen tasks. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through experiments on various text classification datasets, showing that it can achieve comparable or better performance than traditional fine-tuning and multi-tasking approaches while reducing computational costs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel method that reduces the computational burden of fine-tuning large pre-trained language models for each downstream task.
- Experimental results support the effectiveness of the proposed method across multiple tasks, highlighting its flexibility and efficiency.
- The methodology is well-articulated, and the paper is clearly written.

Weaknesses:
- The practical application of the method may be limited due to its relatively low performance on complex real-world tasks and data-scarce scenarios.
- The transferability of source prompts is only validated on similar text classification tasks, lacking exploration of more diverse task pairs.
- Comparisons are made primarily against older methods, neglecting more recent advancements in adapter models and multitask learning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the trade-offs between prefix-based training and multi-task training, particularly regarding memory usage during inference. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with more recent methods in the related work section to better contextualize the proposed approach within the current state of the art. Clarifying the definition of "fixed representation" and enhancing Table 1 with additional columns for clarity would also strengthen the presentation. Lastly, providing clearer measurements of the computational savings achieved by the proposed method would address concerns regarding its efficiency.
