### Key Points
This paper presents a crowdsourcing study that collected 475,000 real-user clicks to enhance interactive segmentation methods and proposes the RClicks benchmark for evaluating these methods based on realistic user interactions. The authors aim to improve understanding of user click patterns and drive the development of more robust interactive segmentation techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper proposes a meaningful benchmark that significantly aids in the evaluation of interactive segmentation.
2. Overall writing is smooth and easy to understand.
3. The dataset construction method is detailed and well-designed.
4. Thorough experiments on existing interactive segmentation models reveal their limitations.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the dataset and benchmark may be insufficient for the conference, as the significance and future research challenges are unclear.
2. The rationale for selecting five display modes is not well-explained, and the choice of task display mode could be confusing.
3. The complexity of the Clickability Model may hinder replication and practical application without extensive resources.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the significance of the RClicks benchmark and its implications for future research.
2. We suggest elaborating on the rationale for the chosen display modes and why the Text Description mode was not used as the task display mode.
3. We encourage the authors to demonstrate the inference speed and resource usage of the Clickability Model to address potential replication challenges.
4. We recommend exploring differences in clicking behavior across devices, such as mouse clicks versus touchscreen taps, to enrich the dataset's applicability. 
5. We suggest providing a URL to a website or GitHub repository for hosting the code to facilitate reproducibility and enhance the impact of the work.
