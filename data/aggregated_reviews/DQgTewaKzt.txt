Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel non-uniform resizing method for local visual tracking that aims to reduce computational demands while maintaining high tracking accuracy. Inspired by human retina processing, the authors propose a method that retains more raw information in the target area during resizing, implemented as a quadratic programming (QP) problem. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through experiments on two local trackers, TransT and OSTrack, across five challenging benchmarks, showing significant performance improvements.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well organized and clearly written, facilitating understanding of the proposed method.
- The non-uniform resizing technique is innovative, allowing for better retention of information in the target area.
- The method achieves impressive performance metrics, notably enabling OSTrack to reach 70.2% AUC on LaSOT at 100fps, closing the performance gap with heavier trackers.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental validation is limited to only two transformer trackers, suggesting a need for additional comparisons with other architectures to enhance generalization claims.
- The performance improvement on TrackingNet is minimal (0.1% gain), lacking detailed explanations for this observation.
- It remains unclear whether the non-uniform resizing is applied to the cropped template, necessitating further analysis for reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental validation by including a broader range of trackers, particularly a purely CNN-based tracker, to strengthen the generalization of their findings. Additionally, we suggest providing a detailed analysis of the minimal performance gain on TrackingNet to clarify the results. It is also essential to explicitly state whether the non-uniform resizing is applied to the cropped template, ensuring the paper is self-contained and reproducible.
