### Key Points
This paper presents a method for designing 2D backdoor attacks against 3D object detection, particularly in the context of autonomous driving. The authors analyze the necessity of such attacks and the shortcomings of existing 2D methods in effectively targeting 3D object detection. They propose the first effective method featuring fusion-aware and LiDAR-Free trigger design, evaluated on the KITTI dataset alongside four baseline attacks. The authors emphasize the challenges of trigger sparsity and inconsistency when projecting 2D inputs into 3D space, advocating for the use of dense and solid-colored triggers.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper provides a well-motivated analysis of the need for 2D backdoor attacks against 3D object detection.  
- The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in experimental results.  
- The focus on the fusion of 2D camera and 3D LiDAR in autonomous driving is relevant and timely.  

Weaknesses:  
- The reference format is inconsistent and requires verification.  
- The evaluation is limited to the KITTI dataset, lacking broader dataset analysis.  
- There is insufficient discussion on the proposed attack's resistance to potential (adaptive) backdoor defenses.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the reference format before submitting the final version. Additionally, it would enhance the paper if the authors could evaluate their method on other datasets. Finally, we suggest that the authors discuss the resistance of the proposed attack to potential (adaptive) backdoor defenses.
