### Key Points
This paper presents a method for 3D object detection from multi-view images, introducing an MVSNet-like approach for depth prediction. It employs probabilistic sampling, soft weighting, and pixel-aligned Gaussian Splatting to enhance depth prediction accuracy, particularly with sparse images, thereby improving the performance of 3D object detection. The authors propose MVSDet, which utilizes a per-frame depth sampling scheme to lift multiview information into a 3D feature volume, ultimately regressing 3D bounding box parameters. The model demonstrates significant performance improvements over others that do not utilize ground truth (GT) depth supervision.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents clear methodologies, including probabilistic depth estimation, which shows strong performance improvements over dense approaches.
- The use of Gaussian Splat-based rendering loss effectively supports the object detection model, particularly in the absence of surface GT for training.
- The contributions are well-supported by ablation studies, providing valuable insights for the community.

Weaknesses:
- The descriptions of the 2D feature extractor and detection head are unclear, raising questions about their similarity to existing models like NeRF-Det.
- The novelty of the methods, particularly the MVSNet-like depth prediction techniques, is limited as they are common in prior works.
- The claim regarding the difficulty of obtaining ground truth geometry for supervision is disputed, as it is possible to use lidar or RGBD cameras for this purpose.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the descriptions regarding the 2D feature extractor and detection head, ensuring they are distinct from existing models. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed explanation of the novelty of the proposed method and addressing the concerns regarding the accessibility of ground truth geometry for training. To enhance the presentation, we encourage the authors to clarify the visual elements in figures, particularly the red points in Fig 1 and the arrows in Fig 2. Finally, we recommend including an ablation study that directly compares the proposed model with GT depth supervision to better illustrate the effectiveness of Gaussian splats.
