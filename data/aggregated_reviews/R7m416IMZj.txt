### Key Points
This paper presents a Knowledge Graph Invariant Learning (KGIL) framework aimed at enhancing knowledge-aware recommendation systems by addressing the noise-rich nature of knowledge graphs. The authors propose generating diverse noisy environments to learn invariant representations through attention mechanisms and adversarial optimization. The methodology is tested on three datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The environment-invariant concept is innovative and well-articulated.
- The paper is well-structured, clearly written, and includes extensive empirical analyses.
- The proposed model shows superior performance with minimal increases in model size and time complexity.

Weaknesses:
- The performance improvements are not significant, with recall metrics showing less than 1% enhancement across datasets.
- Some important baselines are missing, and the technical originality appears low, relying on conventional methods.
- The documentation of the experimental setup is inadequate, lacking essential details such as embedding sizes and matrix dimensions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the performance of the proposed method by incorporating comparisons with critical baselines, such as contrastive learning models like SimGCL. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed explanation of the "random data augmentation" methodology in Section 4.3.1 and clarifying the definition of "noisy environments" with a case study example. The authors should also rectify the typo in Equation 14 and ensure that the experimental setup is thoroughly documented to enhance reproducibility. Finally, addressing the theoretical support for invariant learning with contrastive and adversarial learning would strengthen the paper's contributions.
