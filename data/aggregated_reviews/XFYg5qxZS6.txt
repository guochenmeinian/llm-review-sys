### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method, IM-CRDT, for enacting incremental changes to files in IPFS, addressing the inefficiencies of immutable file modifications by creating new versions. The authors propose modeling data as op-based CRDT updates organized into a Merkle-CRDT DAG, which enhances performance by reducing repetitive traffic and allowing concurrent updates. The paper includes a concrete implementation and various experiments measuring latency and computation time.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The CRDT solution is simple yet effective, as demonstrated by evaluations.
2. A good number of evaluations are provided for a short paper.
3. The workflow of the system is well explained.

Weaknesses:
1. Numerous typos, grammar mistakes, and missing punctuation are present.
2. The logical flow of the paper is confusing.
3. There is no discussion of other attempts to solve the problem of updating files in IPFS.
4. The current work is limited to Set CRDT.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the overall presentation by carefully proofreading the paper and utilizing tools or native speakers to correct writing issues. The authors should clarify the logical flow and provide an overview or intuition of the proposed system, avoiding abrupt transitions between implementation details and system components. Additionally, a discussion comparing IM-CRDT with other existing solutions for updating files in IPFS is essential. To enhance applicability, the authors should explore extending the solution beyond Set CRDT and address the consistency guarantees of IM-CRDT. Finally, the authors could consider implementing a feature to undo previous updates, as suggested in the referenced work by Mao et al.
