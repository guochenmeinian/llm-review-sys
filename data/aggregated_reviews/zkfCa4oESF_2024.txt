### Key Points
This paper presents a new task, "generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL)," aimed at recognizing both seen and unseen objects in vision-language tasks. The authors propose a method based on CLIP that utilizes loss in the "attribute space" for improved performance across classes. Additionally, a dual-space feature alignment module and a Topology-Preserving Reservoir (TPR) are introduced to maintain semantic consistency and prevent overfitting. The method is evaluated through extensive experiments on various datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The proposed approach using the attribute space is novel, with effectiveness validated through detailed comparisons and well-designed ablation studies.  
2. The paper is well-written and the methods are intuitive, particularly the TPR which enhances generalization for unseen classes.  
3. Extensive experiments and ablation studies support the proposed method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:  
1. The concept of "learnable attribute tokens" lacks clarity, particularly regarding their representation for seen classes and their limited benefit for unseen classes.  
2. The dual-space feature alignment lacks innovation, and the "attribute reservoir" is essentially a fully connected layer, raising questions about its operational states.  
3. The reliance on the Pearson correlation coefficient for defining topology-preserving loss is simplistic.  
4. The base attribute vocabulary creation process is unclear, hindering reproducibility.  
5. The model's performance on the SUN dataset is subpar, necessitating a clear explanation from the authors.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of what is learned in "learnable attribute tokens" and provide a detailed analysis of these tokens. Additionally, the authors should clarify the operational states of the "attribute reservoir" and consider enhancing the innovation of the dual-space feature alignment. We suggest exploring more sophisticated methods for defining topology-preserving loss beyond the Pearson correlation coefficient. Furthermore, the authors should provide a clearer description of the base attribute vocabulary creation process to enhance reproducibility. Lastly, a thorough explanation of the model's performance on the SUN dataset is essential for understanding its limitations.
