### Key Points
This paper presents an integrated photonic architecture designed to implement Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), which learn activation functions on edges using cascaded ring-assisted Mach-Zehnder interferometers. The manuscript is well-written and introduces a novel approach that is likely to attract interest from the optical computing research community.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The innovative integration of photonic architecture for KANs is a significant contribution to the field.  
- The clarity of writing enhances the accessibility of the research.

Weaknesses:  
- The architecture's inability to represent arbitrary non-linear activation functions (NAFs) due to limitations in the RAMZI unit's parameters needs further exploration.  
- Claims regarding parameter efficiency, energy efficiency, and latency are based on specific applications without general proof, necessitating clarification.  
- The impact of noise on system performance and its scalability with system size remains unaddressed.  
- The relationship between the number of parameters for KANs versus Optical Neural Networks (ONNs) in terms of performance is unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis of the system's expressibility given the constraints of the RAMZI unit. Additionally, we suggest revising the claims in the abstract and conclusion to provide context for the performance metrics presented. It would be beneficial to investigate how noise affects performance and its scaling with system size. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify whether fewer parameters in ONNs can achieve comparable performance to KANs for specific tasks. Lastly, consider simplifying notation in Eq. 2 by using superscripts for the layer index, e.g., $\phi^{(l)}_{m, n}$.
