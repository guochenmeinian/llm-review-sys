### Key Points
This paper presents MoE (Monitoring Ethereum), an innovative framework that utilizes runtime monitoring to detect transaction-level attacks on Ethereum, employing Metric First-Order Temporal Logic (MFOTL). MoE integrates semantic lifting and quantitative analysis to enhance attack detection, achieving high precision in identifying attacks such as reentrancy and price manipulation across extensive datasets. The framework demonstrates significant potential for real-time monitoring in decentralized finance applications, with experimental results indicating a recall rate of 92% and an average monitoring time of under 23 ms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- MoE effectively combines MFOTL with semantic enhancement, providing a novel solution for Ethereum transaction-level attack detection.
- The framework shows high recall and precision rates, demonstrating its effectiveness across various attack types.
- Extensive experimental evaluation on large datasets supports the framework's practicality and scalability.

Weaknesses:
- The explanations of MFOTL formulas and the semantic lifting approach are dense, making them challenging for readers unfamiliar with formal methods.
- The framework's reliance on subjective threshold settings for quantitative analysis lacks adaptive mechanisms, potentially affecting detection accuracy.
- The paper does not adequately address how MoE adapts to new attack types or the generalizability of its approach to other blockchain platforms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the MFOTL formulas and the semantic lifting approach by including flow diagrams or pseudocode examples. Additionally, providing more explicit examples of how thresholds affect attack detection would enhance the discussion on quantitative analysis. To address concerns about adaptability, the authors should elaborate on the update mechanisms for attack models in response to new threats. Finally, a more detailed exploration of the framework's generalizability to other blockchain systems would strengthen the paper's contributions.
