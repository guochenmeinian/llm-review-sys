### Key Points
This paper presents a large language model (LLM)-based reranking framework for recommender systems that aims to balance accuracy, diversity, and fairness through a chain-of-thought (CoT) process. The authors demonstrate the framework's effectiveness via extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, showing superior performance compared to existing models. The framework integrates user requirements through a universal node structure and prompt templates, addressing the challenges of traditional reranking models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed framework is innovative, leveraging LLMs to automate the fulfillment of personalized user needs.
- Comprehensive experimental results and ablation studies support the framework's strong performance across various metrics.
- The methodology is interesting and promises improvements in the reranking process.

Weaknesses:
- The dependency on LLMs raises concerns about computational costs and efficiency, which may limit scalability in real-world applications.
- Clarity in descriptions, particularly regarding new concepts and the relationships between multiple objectives, is insufficient.
- Some experimental analyses lack convincing power, and the framework does not adequately compare with existing literature on multi-objective recommendations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of descriptions, particularly regarding the introduction of new concepts such as function nodes and history pools, to aid reader comprehension. Additionally, the authors should provide a detailed analysis from the efficiency and latency perspective, including the number of parameters and inference latency compared to baselines. It is also crucial to explore the relationships between multiple objectives and clarify how the framework balances these effectively. Finally, we suggest enhancing the prompt design to account for multiple objectives, as prompts play a critical role in the framework's effectiveness.
