Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies theoretical bounds on the generalization ability of score-matching diffusion models, specifically analyzing the KL divergence between the true distribution and the learned distribution. The authors assume a time-dependent 2-layer random feature model and characterize the generalization bound as a function of sample size \( n \) and model capacity \( m \). They demonstrate that the error decreases polynomially in \( n \) with an appropriately chosen early-stopping time \( \tau \), particularly when the target distribution has compact support. The paper also examines the effect of distance between modes in a toy case of a 2-Gaussian mixture.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper establishes a theoretically analyzable framework for diffusion model generalization based on sample size, model capacity, and training time, employing established methodologies in machine learning theory.
- The analysis effectively addresses the necessary technical components for bounding the generalization error, and the proofs appear sound.
- It serves as a solid foundation for further theoretical exploration of diffusion model generalization, raising pertinent questions regarding dimension dependency and optimal early stopping time.

Weaknesses:
- The focus on 2-layer random feature models is limiting and may be considered outdated compared to modern tools like neural tangent kernels.
- There is insufficient discussion on the optimal solution \( \bar{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^\ast \), particularly regarding the universal approximation property of the random feature model in relation to the score-matching loss.
- The clarity of Section 3.2.2 is questionable, as it only addresses a toy case and provides an upper bound that lacks guarantees of tightness.
- Experimental design is minimal and inconsistent with the theoretical framework, as it relies on a single toy case and does not clarify the number of repetitions or the use of the Adam optimizer.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the optimal solution \( \bar{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^\ast \) by addressing the universal approximation property of the random feature model. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the value and implications of Section 3.2.2, possibly by providing a lower bound to explain the modes shift effect more effectively. The authors should also enhance the experimental section by including more diverse cases, detailing the number of repetitions, and justifying the choice of the Adam optimizer in relation to the continuous-time gradient flow. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the definitions of key terms and assumptions in the main text rather than relegating them to the appendix.
