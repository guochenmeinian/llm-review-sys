Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a goal-conditioned reinforcement learning framework for photo finishing tuning, introducing a novel state representation and treating the image processing pipeline as a black box. The method efficiently tunes parameters to match various goals, achieving optimal results in just 10 queries compared to the 500 typically required by zeroth-order methods. The framework adapts to diverse target images and styles, demonstrating effectiveness in empirical evaluations across photo finishing and stylization tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, clearly explaining the goal-conditioned reinforcement learning approach.
2. The visualization in Figure 1 effectively demonstrates the proposed method's superiority, showing rapid convergence and high-quality results.
3. The application of RL to photo finishing and stylization is effective, with quantitative evaluations indicating substantial improvements in quality, number of queries, and run time.

Weaknesses:
1. The proposed RL-based framework may not generalize well to unseen datasets compared to search-based methods.
2. The efficiency comparison in Table 2 may not be entirely fair, as the CMAES method runs on CPUs without exploring potential speed-ups through multi-processing.
3. Some algorithmic choices lack clear motivation, and additional ablation studies would enhance the findings' persuasiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivations behind algorithmic choices and provide full details on the implementation of baselines to ensure reproducibility. Conducting more ablation studies, particularly exploring the impact of RL versus a greedy algorithm, would elevate the paper's quality. Additionally, we suggest evaluating the proposed method across multiple seeds to provide a more robust comparison and discussing the reasons for its superior generalization capability in greater detail.
