Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new class of correlated equilibria termed linear-deviation correlated equilibria (LCE), which can be approached efficiently if players achieve sublinear linear-swap regret. The authors demonstrate that LCEs are distinct from both correlated equilibria and extensive-form correlated equilibria (EFCE), and they explore the complexities of maximizing social welfare within LCEs. They also differentiate between no-linear-swap-regret dynamics and no-trigger-regret dynamics through theoretical results illustrated in a small game.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Introduction of a new class of correlated equilibria.
- Technical contribution includes a polynomial characterization of linear transformations from a sequence-form strategy polytope to itself.
- Development of a general algorithm for minimizing linear-swap regret.
- Clear connections to existing equilibrium classes.
- The paper is well-written and is expected to inspire future research.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical nature of the paper raises questions about the practical motivation for pursuing LCEs over other correlation classes.
- The notion of LCE lacks clear motivation, and the algorithm's slower convergence to EFCEs compared to existing algorithms diminishes its contribution.
- The intuitive understanding of linear swap transformations is insufficiently developed, and the experimental results do not convincingly demonstrate the strength of LCEs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for LCEs by providing examples where LCEs serve as a reasonable solution concept compared to other EFCEs. Additionally, we suggest including a visual depiction of the different classes of equilibria to enhance pedagogical value. Clarifying the main challenges and implications of Theorem 3.1 would also strengthen the paper. Finally, we encourage the authors to address the running times of the algorithms more thoroughly, particularly in relation to their convergence rates.
