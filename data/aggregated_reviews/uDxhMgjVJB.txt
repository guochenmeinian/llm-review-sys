Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for regression tasks with outliers, utilizing an optimal transport cost function and a novel concave cost function to facilitate outlier rectification. The authors provide mathematical proofs and evaluate their method on two simpler and one real-world task, achieving state-of-the-art results. The integration of outlier detection and estimation into a single optimization process enhances efficiency, with the proposed method outperforming traditional approaches in various tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The theory of robust statistics is well-explained and contextualized, particularly through Fig. 1.
- The paper is exceptionally organized, and all proofs in Appendix C are generally easy to understand.
- Experiments are detailed, allowing for both surface and deeper comprehension of the topics.

Weaknesses:
- Some tasks involve artificially constructed outliers, which may not reflect real-world data corruption.
- The proprietary nature of the code/data may hinder reproducibility.
- The baseline methods used in experiments are outdated, and there is a lack of robust variants of regular estimators for comparison.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental design by including more realistic outlier distributions and addressing the absence of robust estimator baselines. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the relationship between the proposed method and M-estimators and RANSAC. The authors should also ensure that all references and citations are accurate and complete, particularly correcting the references to equations and missing citations noted in the reviews. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide more figures illustrating the selected knot points and lambda to enhance clarity.
