Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an approach for self-adaptive motion tracking using on-body flexible sensors, addressing the challenge of sensor displacement during operation. The authors propose a network that includes a learnable Affine Transformation layer, a Fourier-encoded LSTM for pattern recognition, and a sequence discrepancy loss with auxiliary regressors for unsupervised tuning of parameters. The proposed techniques are evaluated through practical experiments, demonstrating improved accuracy in predicting joint angles compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem setup is well motivated and relevant for motion tracking applications.
- The paper is well-structured, with a clear processing pipeline and formulation.
- The combination of techniques (affine transformation, Fourier LSTM, sequence discrepancy loss) is novel and practical.
- Empirical evaluations include ablation studies and comparisons to existing methods, showing promising results.

Weaknesses:
- The application is narrow, focusing on a specific sensor type and small dataset, limiting generalizability.
- Experiments are conducted on data from a limited number of participants, raising concerns about the robustness of the findings.
- The paper lacks comparisons with basic baselines from the signal processing field, such as state-space models.
- Missing references to relevant SOTA methods and a detailed analysis of the method's boundaries regarding noise and sensor displacement.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by conducting experiments on a more diverse dataset that includes multiple participants and sensor types. Additionally, we suggest integrating comparisons with basic baselines, such as extended Kalman filters or particle filters, to strengthen the methodological framework. The authors should also address the limitations regarding noise and sensor displacement handling more thoroughly. Furthermore, we advise revising Section 2.3 to eliminate redundancy with the Introduction and enhancing the discussion on the potential broader impact of their method beyond the specific application.
