Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a data-centric framework, APT, for cross-domain graph pre-training, which includes a graph selector and a pre-training model. The authors propose that selecting representative data points based on graph properties and predictive uncertainty can enhance model performance without the need for large datasets. Experimental results indicate that APT outperforms existing methods, demonstrating the significance of data selection in graph pre-training.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The approach challenges the conventional reliance on large datasets, suggesting that carefully selected samples can yield better results.
2. The framework is well-motivated, clearly described, and shows promising experimental outcomes.
3. The theoretical justification for predictive uncertainty is established, linking it to conventional definitions of uncertainty.

Weaknesses:
1. The optimization problem in equation 5 is unclear, particularly regarding the variables involved. The authors should clarify whether they are selecting graphs based on a scoring function rather than formulating an optimization problem.
2. The methodology lacks clarity in several areas, such as the role of M in line 296 and the efficiency of the proposed method compared to baseline pre-training.
3. The motivation for the additional property criteria is ambiguous, especially given their correlation with network entropy, raising questions about their necessity.
4. The paper does not adequately address limitations or provide individual ablation studies for the graph selector's effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the optimization problem in equation 5 by specifying the variables being optimized. Additionally, the authors should provide clearer descriptions of key terms and concepts, such as M in line 296 and the efficiency of their method. It would be beneficial to justify the inclusion of the additional property criteria or consider their removal. We also suggest conducting individual ablation experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the graph selector for each property. Lastly, the authors should explicitly state the limitations of their work in both the appendix and the main body of the paper.
