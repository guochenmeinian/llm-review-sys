### Key Points
This paper presents the Realizing Human Expertise through AI (RHEA) framework, designed to integrate and distill solutions from diverse expert models to address complex problems, particularly in public health. The framework consists of four steps: Define Problem, Gather Solutions, Distill Model, and Evolve Solution. The authors demonstrate RHEA's effectiveness through examples in both synthetic and real-world contexts, including COVID-19 intervention policies, highlighting its potential to yield superior policy strategies compared to individual AI or human expert inputs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The authors propose a novel framework that creatively combines human expertise with an evolutionary approach, addressing a significant challenge in AI applications.  
- The paper is well-structured, clearly written, and presents thorough qualitative and quantitative analyses of the solutions.  
- RHEA's ability to realize latent potential in diverse expert contributions is a notable strength, suggesting broad applicability beyond the immediate examples provided.  

Weaknesses:  
- Explanations of the "Distill" process lack clarity and detail, hindering reader understanding.  
- The contribution section requires more specificity to clearly articulate the framework's impact.  
- Limited generalizability is a concern, as the primary application focuses on COVID-19, with insufficient exploration of other potential domains.  
- The paper does not adequately compare RHEA to state-of-the-art methods in policy optimization or ensemble learning, raising questions about its relative performance.  
- The lack of theoretical guarantees regarding RHEA's properties and performance under various conditions is a significant limitation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the "Distill" process by providing more detailed explanations and examples. Additionally, the contribution section should be revised to explicitly outline the framework's significance and broader applicability. To enhance the paper's robustness, include comparisons to relevant baseline methods in policy optimization and discuss the theoretical properties of RHEA, such as convergence guarantees and performance bounds. Furthermore, addressing the generalizability of RHEA to other domains and the computational complexities associated with scaling the framework would strengthen the overall presentation. Finally, consider moving some detailed analyses to the appendix to streamline the main text and improve focus on the framework's novel aspects.
