Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies model evaluation under distribution shifts by formulating a planning problem for selecting inputs for labeling from a large pool of unlabeled data. The authors propose an auto-differentiable planning framework to compute reliable policy gradients and update the sampling policy. They demonstrate the utility of this framework through a one-step lookahead policy that outperforms active learning-based heuristics and REINFORCE policy gradients. The work also formulates data labeling as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), introducing components such as K-subset sampling and an Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) module, achieving significant performance improvements on both synthetic and real-world data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- **Clear presentation**: The paper is well-structured, with figures illustrating the adaptive sampling framework, aiding understanding.
- **Detailed explanations**: The authors provide comprehensive explanations of the UQ module and sampling methods, making complex concepts accessible.
- **Novel approach**: Formulating model evaluation as an RL problem is innovative and potentially valuable.

Weaknesses:
- **Computational inefficiency**: The method requires substantial computational resources, limiting comparisons in Section 4.2 and leaving multi-step planning unresolved.
- **Fixed labeling cost assumption**: The assumption of equal labeling costs is unrealistic; variable costs should be considered.
- **Lack of theoretical guarantees**: The absence of theoretical guarantees for the method is a significant drawback.
- **Confusing presentation**: Certain sections, particularly Section 4, lack clarity and organization, hindering comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the computational efficiency of their method to allow for more comprehensive evaluations and comparisons. Additionally, consider incorporating variable labeling costs to reflect practical scenarios more accurately. The authors should also provide theoretical guarantees for their method to strengthen its validity. Furthermore, we suggest reorganizing Section 4 to include an overall description of the proposed method and the pseudo-code for Algorithm 1 earlier in the section to enhance clarity. Lastly, addressing the confusing elements in the presentation, such as the definitions of terms and the purpose of figures, would significantly improve the paper's readability.
