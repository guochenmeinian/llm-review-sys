Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the role of message passing (MP) in collaborative filtering (CF), challenging the assumption that performance gains arise solely from improved representation learning. The authors find that MP primarily benefits CF through forward passes rather than back-propagation, and it is particularly advantageous for low-degree users. Based on these findings, the authors propose TAG-CF, a test-time aggregation framework that integrates easily into existing CF models, demonstrating competitive performance while reducing computational overhead.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses an important open problem regarding the role of MP in CF, providing both empirical and theoretical insights.
2. The proposed TAG-CF method is efficient and effectively integrates into existing systems.
3. The structure of the paper is logical, with clear transitions between analysis and proposal.

Weaknesses:
1. Theoretical validation of the findings is challenged by Equation 4, which does not adequately separate forward pass neighbor representation from backward pass gradient updates.
2. The paper lacks a rigorous discussion following Theorem 1, particularly regarding the assumptions made about LightGCN.
3. Important baselines such as GFCF and SVD-GCN are missing from the experiments, which limits the comparative analysis of TAG-CF's performance.
4. The evaluation metrics used do not include NDCG@10 and Recall@10, which are more reflective of user preferences.
5. There are numerous grammatical issues throughout the paper that need addressing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical validation of their findings, particularly by addressing the limitations of Equation 4. Additionally, a more rigorous discussion following Theorem 1 is necessary, including experiments that compare TAG-CF directly with LightGCN-BPR. The authors should include important baselines like GFCF and SVD-GCN in their experiments to provide a clearer context for TAG-CF's advantages. We also suggest incorporating evaluation metrics such as NDCG@10 and Recall@10 to better reflect the effectiveness of the recommendation models. Finally, we urge the authors to revise the paper for grammatical accuracy to enhance clarity and professionalism.
