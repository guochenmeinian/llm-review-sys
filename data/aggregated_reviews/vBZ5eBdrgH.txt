### Key Points
This paper presents a method for synthesizing a pseudo-parallel corpus for low-resource language (LRL) pairs using a parallel corpus from a linguistically-close high-resource language (HRL) pair. The authors propose an unsupervised approach that builds a database of HRL character edit operations to generate LRL (sub)words from HRL words. Experimental results indicate consistent improvements in translation quality across several languages compared to various vocabulary regularization techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method does not require parallel corpora, making it applicable to many LRL pairs.
- It is linguistically intuitive and has potential for incorporating additional linguistic knowledge.
- The method performs better than word-substitute techniques and alleviates reliance on available training resources.

Weaknesses:
- The method's effectiveness may be limited to LRLs closely related to the HRL, and the paper lacks detailed analyses of generalization across different language families.
- The evaluation is primarily focused on ELRLs and English, which raises questions about the method's applicability to other languages.
- The metrics used for performance measurement may be insufficient or contradictory.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of how linguistic relatedness affects the viability of the proposed approach. Additionally, consider expanding the experiments to include more languages from different families or character systems to strengthen the conclusions. We also suggest providing more quantitative evaluation results, such as COMETKIWI and UniTE, to support the significance of the improvements in model performance. Finally, clarify the definitions of zero-shot and few-shot translation, and address how to handle multi-sense words in varying contexts.
