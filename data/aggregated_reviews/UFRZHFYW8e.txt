Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents RAVL, a method aimed at identifying and mitigating spurious correlations in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). The authors focus on two main aspects: prioritizing local image features over global features and emphasizing the fine-tuning phase rather than pre-training. The method involves extracting candidate image features from the validation set, filtering them to identify those contributing to classification errors, and ranking these features based on their spurious correlations. The authors regularize the dissimilarity between spurious regions and correlated labels while promoting high embedding similarity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and easy to follow.
- The proposed framework is novel and its contribution is slightly above the acceptance threshold.
- Quantitative performance enhancements effectively demonstrate the proposed method's efficacy.

Weaknesses:
- The framework is limited to addressing geometric spurious correlations, neglecting other potential sources such as texture and background.
- There is a lack of qualitative visualizations to illustrate which regions impact class predictions, which is crucial for understanding model behavior.
- The computational complexity analysis is missing, raising concerns about the feasibility of the method given the need for extensive image segmentation and clustering.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the framework by considering feature maps as candidates and filtering them channel-wise, which could provide a more comprehensive approach to mitigating spurious correlations. Additionally, we suggest including qualitative visualizations to clarify the impact of specific regions on classification outcomes. An analysis of the computational complexity should be added to address concerns regarding the method's efficiency. Lastly, the authors should clarify the determination of hyperparameters used in the spurious correlation discovery and mitigation stages, as well as provide region-level labels for the evaluation dataset.
