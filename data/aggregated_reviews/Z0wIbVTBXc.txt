Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Neural Flow Diffusion Models (NFDM), which introduce a learnable forward process to enhance diffusion modeling, addressing the limitations of traditional models that rely on fixed forward processes. NFDM demonstrates improved generative dynamics and flexibility, achieving state-of-the-art results in negative log-likelihood on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. The framework also shows its utility in learning bridges between distributions on the AFHQ dataset. The authors provide a solid theoretical foundation and extensive experimental validation, making the paper accessible and well-structured.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a learnable forward process in diffusion models represents a significant innovation, opening new research avenues.
- The theoretical underpinning is robust, with thorough explanations of the mathematical principles and optimization of the learnable forward process.
- Experimental results are extensive and statistically rigorous, demonstrating practical effectiveness on recognized benchmarks.
- The paper is well-written and clearly structured, making it accessible to both experts and newcomers.

Weaknesses:
- The paper does not reference or compare NFDM with Shiftddpms, which also incorporates a learnable forward process, limiting the contextual understanding of its novelty.
- There is insufficient discussion on the generalization of results to other settings and the robustness of findings under different conditions, which may affect confidence in broader applications.
- Clarity in exposition, particularly in Section 3, could be improved, as the notation complexity may hinder understanding.
- The necessity and effectiveness of the non-Gaussian parameterization compared to Gaussian remain unclear, as no substantial improvement is demonstrated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the contextual placement of NFDM by referencing and comparing it with Shiftddpms to clarify its novelty. Additionally, the authors should discuss the generalization of their results and the robustness of their findings more extensively. To enhance clarity, particularly in Section 3, consider providing diagrams to illustrate relationships between various components. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors provide theoretical or empirical evidence to support claims regarding the limitations of conventional diffusion models and clarify the necessity of the non-Gaussian parameterization, especially in light of the lack of significant improvement over Gaussian parameterization.
