### Key Points
This paper presents a novel strategy of task-adaptive tokenization aimed at enhancing generation pipelines for specific downstream tasks, particularly in long-form generation for psychological question-answering in both Chinese and English. The authors propose constructing a tokenizer from task data with variable segmentation, integrating it with existing training tokenization to extend off-the-shelf language models. The method demonstrates potential applicability across various domains and languages, supported by clear writing and detailed explanations of motivation, methodology, and experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses the challenge of downstream domain adaptation through a new lens, moving beyond traditional post-training fine-tuning.
- The proposed method is effective and efficient across different pretrained models, supported by cognitive linguistic studies.
- The approach is simple to implement and shows promise for handling domain-specific terminologies.

Weaknesses:
- Further quantification of results for the token mapping strategy is needed, particularly regarding the frequency of response tokens.
- The evaluation could benefit from additional examples to illustrate the mapping mechanism's impact on model performance.
- The relationship between improvements and the number of training examples versus better tokenization remains unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the quantification of results for the token mapping strategy, particularly by analyzing the frequency changes of original, overlapping, and non-overlapping tokens. Additionally, including more examples in the case study would help clarify how the mapping mechanism enhances performance. Addressing the performance drop in the human evaluation section due to the MHP dataset's data scarcity would also strengthen the paper. Finally, we suggest testing the proposed method with only the newly constructed vocabulary to establish a critical baseline for its necessity across general tasks beyond mental health.
