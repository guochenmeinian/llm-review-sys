### Key Points
This paper presents a large-scale measurement study of DNS-over-Encryption (DoE) protocols, including DNS-over-TLS (DoT), DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH), DNS-over-QUIC (DoQ), and DNS-over-HTTP/3 (DoH3), across both IPv4 and IPv6. The authors discovered over 1,000 DoE domains and measured them using 5,000 vantage points (VPs) over two months, revealing that many DoE requests are still blocked. The study includes a detailed analysis of disruption types caused by adversaries and offers suggestions for improving DoE resolution.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study is comprehensive, with a systematic investigation of DoE services across 102 countries and a long-term data collection approach.
- The methodology is well-documented, and the data collected is publicly available, which is beneficial for future research.
- The authors provide interesting findings regarding the blocking strategies employed against DoE services.

Weaknesses:
- Some findings are already known in the literature, and the motivation for the study lacks appropriate contextualization.
- The methodology for selecting VPs may introduce bias, as it does not adequately represent domestic Internet connections.
- The actionable insights drawn from the experimental studies are unclear, particularly regarding the implications of government policies versus technical limitations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the contextualization of their study by providing numbers on the current prevalence of DoE services to underscore the significance of their findings. Additionally, we suggest including a separate section on known public resolvers to clarify their role in the study. The authors should consider discussing the effectiveness of their ad-hoc approach in identifying DoE domains and provide a breakdown of censoring methods in Section 4.5. Expanding on the recommendation to hide DoE domains in social networks would also enhance the paper. Finally, addressing the limitations of using cloud data centers for VPs and exploring alternative methods, such as peer-to-peer proxies, could provide a more representative analysis of DoE reachability.
