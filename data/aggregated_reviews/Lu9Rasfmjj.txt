Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to off-policy evaluation (OPE) in the presence of unobserved confounders, specifically introducing the concept of two-way unmeasured confounders. The authors propose a generative model that incorporates both time-invariant and trajectory-invariant confounders, utilizing a neural tensor network for estimating transitions and actions. The empirical evaluation demonstrates the method's robustness, showing lower LMSE and LMAE compared to traditional techniques across various simulation studies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of the two-way confounding assumption is original and well-motivated, marking a significant contribution to causal reinforcement learning.
- The empirical results indicate strong performance, with the proposed method outperforming existing techniques in multiple scenarios.
- The writing is clear, with well-defined variables and assumptions, enhancing reader comprehension.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical justification for the estimator is weak, lacking sufficient references and clarity regarding the assumptions made.
- Certain notations and terms are not well-defined, leading to potential confusion.
- The paper does not sufficiently engage with existing literature on deconfounder algorithms, particularly the foundational work by Wang and Blei (2019).

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by defining terms such as $\mathbb{E}^\pi$ and the $\cup$ notation early in the paper. Introducing the estimator before the model would help contextualize the quantities being estimated. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more thorough discussion of the limitations of their assumptions, particularly regarding the two-way confounder model and its relationship to existing deconfounder literature. Expanding the introduction to include a brief explanation of two-way unmeasured confounding would also enhance accessibility for readers unfamiliar with the topic. Finally, addressing the theoretical concerns raised, particularly regarding the estimator's validity and the marginalization of latent variables, would strengthen the paper's foundation.
