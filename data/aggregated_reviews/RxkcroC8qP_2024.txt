Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an end-to-end EEG-based visual decoding framework that includes a brain encoder for EEG feature extraction and a generator for image reconstruction. The authors propose a two-stage EEG-to-image generation strategy and demonstrate effective results in retrieval, classification, and reconstruction tasks across two datasets, indicating potential applications for real-time brain-computer interfaces. The framework is built upon the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM) and achieves state-of-the-art performance in various tasks. However, the novelty of the approach in the context of existing methodologies is questioned. Additionally, the authors have incorporated feedback from multiple reviews to enhance the quality of their work, aiming to address reviewers' comments and improve overall clarity and depth.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research demonstrates the feasibility of using non-invasive EEG signals for image decoding, providing a valuable reference for EEG feature extraction.
- Comprehensive EEG experiments cover retrieval, classification, and visual stimulus reconstruction, with cross-subject considerations.
- The authors have effectively utilized feedback from various reviews to refine their analysis, demonstrating a commitment to improving their work.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity regarding the novelty of its contributions, particularly in comparison to existing methods like NICE and fMRI-based techniques.
- The method for disentangling low- and high-level features is unclear, especially concerning the VAE's role in providing low-level image features.
- Several conclusions in the evaluation section conflict with established neuroscience principles, raising concerns about scientific validity.
- The urgency expressed in the communication suggests a potential lack of time management in addressing the reviews comprehensively.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the novelty of their contributions, particularly in relation to existing methodologies. It would be beneficial to provide a more detailed explanation of the ATM encoder and its differences from previous studies. Additionally, the authors should clarify the method for disentangling low- and high-level features and address the conflicting conclusions in the evaluation section. Specifically, we suggest that the authors provide rigorous testing protocols, such as using a validation set, and elaborate on the critical inputs to the diffusion process for image generation. Including metrics like PixCorr for low-level evaluations and clarifying the experimental settings in Table 1 would enhance the manuscript's comprehensibility. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve their time management to ensure a thorough response to reviewer comments before deadlines and confirm whether the rebuttal meets expectations to further enhance the paper's quality.
