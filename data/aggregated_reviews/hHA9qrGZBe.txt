### Key Points
This paper presents HARMONIC, an LLM-based framework for private synthetic data generation, which allows LLMs to randomly sample synthetic data from a hidden space learned from an instruction fine-tuning dataset. The generated data maintains a similar distribution to the original data, ensuring utility for downstream tasks while protecting sensitive information. The authors propose two metrics to measure accuracy and privacy. The framework demonstrates comparable performance to real data, with superior privacy protection against data leakage.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses the critical issue of generating private synthetic data using LLMs, which is essential for protecting sensitive information.
2. The innovative use of KNN to construct the instruction fine-tuning dataset is both simple and effective, aiding LLMs in learning the original data distribution.
3. The introduction of two new metrics for measuring accuracy and privacy enhances the framework's evaluation.

Weaknesses:
1. The method lacks novelty and primarily focuses on classification tasks, raising questions about its applicability to regression.
2. The reliance on large pre-trained LLMs may pose practical challenges due to high computational resource demands.
3. The paper does not adequately discuss related works on differential privacy in synthetic data generation, limiting its contextual relevance.
4. Important works on tabular data generation are not cited, which weakens the literature review.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors include records that are far from the sample in the fine-tuning dataset to help LLMs learn the data distribution more comprehensively.
2. The authors should explore learning the correlation between columns to improve utility, as the current method does not guarantee maintained correlations.
3. We suggest providing a formal guarantee of privacy to address concerns regarding membership inference attacks.
4. The authors should enhance reproducibility by including more detailed configuration and implementation information.
5. We recommend expanding the benchmark to include important approaches such as PrivBayes and utilizing a broader selection of metrics available in tools like syntheval or synthcity.
6. The authors should address the ethical implications of using synthetic data, particularly in sensitive domains, and discuss how HARMONIC ensures fairness and avoids perpetuating biases.
