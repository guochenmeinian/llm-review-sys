### Key Points
This paper presents a rumor detection model utilizing contrastive learning and knowledge distillation, addressing multi-modal scenarios and cases with missing modalities. The teacher model achieves good classification results through feature fusion and supervised contrastive learning, while the student model benefits from knowledge distillation using soft labels from the teacher model, enhancing its performance in scenarios with missing modalities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Proposes a multi-modal teacher model to guide a single-modal student model.
- Comprehensive experimental results, including various analyses and ablation studies.
- Addresses the important issue of missing modality in rumor detection, contributing to multimodal classification in social media.

Weaknesses:
- Lack of justification for the use of supervised contrastive learning.
- Comparisons are limited to a 2020 multi-modal model, and the effectiveness of the student model is not benchmarked against other models.
- Experiments primarily focus on multi-modal scenarios, neglecting the perspective of missing modalities, which is central to the paper's motivation.
- Testing is confined to two datasets, raising concerns about generalizability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for using supervised contrastive learning. Additionally, the authors should expand their experiments to include a wider range of benchmark datasets for better validation of their method. It would be beneficial to address the missing text information case and clarify the scalability and efficiency of their approach compared to baseline models. We also suggest moving the analysis on the number of comments to the main body of the paper for greater emphasis. Lastly, please correct the identified typos in the manuscript.
