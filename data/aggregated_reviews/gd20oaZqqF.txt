Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative framework for mitigating the high resource consumption and latency challenges of large language models (LLMs) by integrating caching and model selection strategies. The authors propose a theoretically optimal algorithm that optimizes both caching and model selection in offline and online settings, demonstrating its effectiveness through simulations and real-world dataset experiments. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research directions in caching and model selection optimization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel approach that creatively merges caching with model selection to address the resource-intensive nature of LLMs.
- It provides strong theoretical guarantees and empirical validation, leveraging established caching algorithms like Greedy Dual Size with Frequency (GDSF) and Least Expected Cost (LEC).
- The framework is well-structured, effectively communicating complex ideas and methodologies.
- The significance of addressing resource consumption and latency in LLM deployment is highlighted, with potential broad impacts on real-world AI applications.

Weaknesses:
- The model selection experiments consider a limited number of models, raising concerns about scalability to thousands or millions of models.
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion on prompt representation in caching, which is crucial for efficient LLM serving.
- The novelty of the approach is questioned, as the concepts are well-known in the field.
- Section 5.2 lacks important details, making it difficult to assess the practical contribution of the proposed approach.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the scalability discussion by providing theoretical or experimental insights on the algorithm's performance when selecting from a large number of models. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on how prompts are represented in the cache to address this critical aspect of LLM serving. We encourage the authors to investigate the cost-accuracy trade-off more thoroughly, presenting results as a cost-accuracy Pareto curve. Furthermore, the authors should consider building a semantic search-based cache to evaluate its impact on the accuracy-cost trade-off. Lastly, we suggest including detailed evaluation protocols in the appendix and addressing the limitations and potential societal impacts of their approach, particularly regarding bias and centralization in AI.
