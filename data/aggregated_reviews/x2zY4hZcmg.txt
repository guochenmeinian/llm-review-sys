Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Dynamic Model Predictive Shielding (DMPS), an enhancement of Model Predictive Shielding (MPS) aimed at addressing MPS's overconservatism, which can hinder exploration and slow convergence in reinforcement learning (RL). DMPS incorporates a local planner that utilizes both a pre-computed backup policy and the Q-values of the neural task policy to optimize for safe actions while maximizing expected returns. The authors provide formal guarantees regarding safety and demonstrate that DMPS outperforms MPS and other baseline methods across various benchmarks in terms of performance and safety. Additionally, the authors propose truncating the planner horizon at test time to enhance efficiency, showing that a model trained with a higher horizon can perform well with a lower horizon during evaluation. Empirical results indicate significant performance improvements when using a truncated horizon, and the authors acknowledge the potential inaccuracies of their analytic models, suggesting that further research could focus on integrating more accurate models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with clear explanations and a well-structured framework that includes formalization and visual aids.
- The theoretical analysis of recovery regret is compelling, and the extensive experimental evaluation convincingly demonstrates the advantages of DMPS over existing methods.
- The approach of truncating the planner horizon at test time allows for efficient real-time operation, and empirical results validate the effectiveness of this method, showing substantial performance gains with lower horizon planners.
- The acknowledgment of model inaccuracies and the suggestion for future research directions indicate a thoughtful approach to the limitations of the current work.

Weaknesses:
- The computational complexity and scalability of DMPS are not adequately addressed, particularly regarding the time required for the local planner and the implications of using a deterministic dynamics model.
- The novelty of the approach is questioned, as similar methods for estimating safety Q-values and planning have been explored in prior literature.
- The reliance on analytic models may lead to inaccuracies in planned trajectories, which could affect performance in practical applications.
- The choice of a short planning horizon may not be sufficient for all environments, potentially reverting performance to that of MPS.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of computational complexity by including specific details about the implementation of the local planner, such as planning times and the computational overhead involved. Additionally, we suggest that the authors expand on the limitations section to address the challenges of selecting an appropriate planning horizon and the implications of relying on a deterministic dynamics model. Clarifying how the safe invariant set is computed—whether before training or on-the-fly—would also enhance the paper's clarity. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the accuracy of their analytic models to mitigate the divergence of planned trajectories from reality. Finally, exploring the integration of learned models with their current framework could enhance the robustness and applicability of their approach, and considering comparisons with other RL algorithms, such as PPO-Lag and DDPG-Lag, could strengthen the experimental results.
