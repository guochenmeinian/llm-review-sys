Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ZipCache, an adaptive mixed-precision quantization method for compressing KV cache in large language models (LLMs). It introduces a channel-separable tokenwise quantization scheme that effectively reduces memory overhead by accurately identifying salient tokens using a saliency metric based on normalized attention scores. This approach allows for aggressive quantization of less salient data while preserving essential information, resulting in higher compression ratios with minimal impact on model accuracy. The method integrates efficiently with FlashAttention, and experimental results demonstrate its superiority in speed and accuracy compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The intuitive approach of preserving salient tokens while compressing less critical ones is effective, with the proposed saliency metric being crucial for this.
2. The novel channel-separable tokenwise quantization scheme provides significant memory savings compared to group-wise quantization methods.
3. Strong experimental results on GSM8k and HumanEval convincingly showcase the benefits of adaptive KV cache compression.
4. Integration with FlashAttention enhances overall generation speed.
5. The paper is well-organized and clearly written.

Weaknesses:
1. The evaluation of ZipCache should include a broader range of generation and comprehension tasks to strengthen the findings.
2. The font size in Figures 5 and 6 is too small, hindering readability.
3. The idea of channel-separable quantization is not entirely novel, as similar concepts exist in prior works.
4. The paper lacks ablation studies to analyze the contributions of different components.
5. The implementation details regarding system-level performance and comparisons with static methods are insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation of ZipCache by including a wider variety of tasks, such as LongBench, to comprehensively assess its effectiveness. Additionally, increasing the font size in Figures 5 and 6 would enhance clarity. We suggest providing more detailed analysis and discussion regarding the novelty of the channel-separable quantization approach, as well as including ablation studies to clarify the contributions of various components. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the system-level implementation details to better demonstrate the speedup on a single GPU inference system.
