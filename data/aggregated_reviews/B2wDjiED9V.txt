### Key Points
This paper presents a significant contribution to the challenge of unlearning in generative models, specifically within diffusion models. The authors propose a variational inference-based method for facilitating data unlearning, providing a comprehensive derivation of their approach and highlighting necessary adaptations from prior work. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of their method in practical scenarios, particularly demonstrating its performance on datasets like MNIST and CIFAR.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is of high quality and clarity, making it easy to follow and replicate.  
- The use of variational inference is elegantly set up, with thorough theoretical justification.  
- The proposed method shows strong performance in both MNIST and CIFAR, offering a novel approach to unlearning grounded in variational inference.  

Weaknesses:  
- The method could be enhanced by allowing users to unlearn specific features in favor of others, such as producing 5s instead of 1s in MNIST.  
- The authors could benchmark their approach against more existing methods from the literature, such as the work by Li et al. on machine unlearning for image-to-image generative models.  
- There are issues with linguistic and mathematical clarity, including grammatical errors and inaccuracies in equation 1 regarding conditional independence.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve their method by enabling users to unlearn specific features in favor of others. Additionally, we suggest benchmarking their approach against existing methods from the literature to provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Finally, we advise addressing the linguistic and mathematical clarity issues, particularly rewording lines 191-192, correcting the conditional independence statement in equation 1, and modifying "Let's" to "Let" in line 267.
