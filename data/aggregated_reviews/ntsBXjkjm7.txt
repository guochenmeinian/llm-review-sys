### Key Points
This paper presents a method called Differentially Private Structured State Space Diffusion (DP-SSSD) for generating high-quality differentially private synthetic sequential data, specifically targeting electrocardiograms (ECGs) and electroencephalograms (EEGs). The authors demonstrate that DP-SSSD outperforms previous methods, such as RDP-CGAN, in generating more realistic data under equivalent privacy constraints. The paper also discusses techniques to improve the privacy-utility trade-off by fixing certain weight parameters during training.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed DP-SSSD method effectively combines structured state space models and diffusion models, leading to improved data quality.
- Empirical evaluations indicate that DP-SSSD generates more realistic and diverse synthetic data compared to prior methods.

Weaknesses:  
- Algorithm details lack clarity, undermining confidence in experimental results.
- Inaccurate descriptions, such as the role of $\delta$ in privacy protection, and omissions regarding the estimation of $\epsilon$ are present.
- Ablation studies are incomplete, providing limited information by comparing only one model for each comparison.
- The paper does not address the unexplained discrepancy in dataset label proportions and is limited to ECG and EEG datasets, lacking broader generalization.
- There are no practical guidelines for selecting privacy parameters, which is crucial for real-world applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of algorithm details to enhance confidence in the experimental results. Additionally, the authors should correct inaccuracies in descriptions, particularly regarding the privacy parameters, and include a comprehensive explanation of how to calculate $\epsilon$. We suggest conducting more extensive ablation studies to provide a fuller understanding of the model's performance. To address dataset generalization, we recommend evaluating the method on a wider range of sequential data beyond ECG and EEG. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide practical guidelines for choosing privacy parameters to enhance the paper's relevance to practitioners.
