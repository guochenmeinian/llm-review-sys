Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents MLLMGUARD, a comprehensive safety evaluation suite for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), addressing five safety dimensions: Privacy, Bias, Toxicity, Truthfulness, and Legality. It includes a bilingual image-text dataset and the GUARDRANK evaluator, which outperforms GPT-4 in accuracy. The evaluation confirms that current MLLMs require significant improvements to ensure safety and responsibility.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- MLLMGUARD offers a robust safety evaluation suite with a bilingual dataset and advanced evaluation tools.
- The paper provides a fine-grained evaluation metric design and a thorough assessment of MLLMs.
- The writing is clear and well-organized, facilitating understanding of the methodology and results.

Weaknesses:
- The benchmark dataset is not sufficiently large and requires expansion.
- The relationship between images and texts in the dataset needs further exploration, particularly regarding combinations that may lead to toxic outputs.
- The diversity of the dataset is inadequately analyzed, and the red team design does not consider this aspect.
- Limitations and ethical implications are discussed only in the appendix, lacking prominence in the main body.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the size of the benchmark dataset to enhance its robustness. Additionally, further exploration of the relationship between images and texts is essential, particularly in identifying combinations that may increase the likelihood of toxic outputs. An analysis of the dataset's diversity should also be included, as this is crucial for the effectiveness of red team models. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors move the discussion of limitations and ethical impacts into the main body of the paper for better visibility. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide a clearer definition of safety categories and guidelines for labeling, especially in contentious areas like legality.
