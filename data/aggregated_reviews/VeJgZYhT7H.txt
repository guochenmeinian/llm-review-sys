Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents WineSensed, a novel multimodal dataset for modeling flavor perception, comprising 897k wine images, 824k text reviews, metadata for 350k wines, and 5k human flavor similarity annotations. Key contributions include a large-scale dataset, a unique "Napping" annotation methodology for fine-grained flavor similarities, and the FEAST multimodal embedding method that aligns semantic representations with human flavor similarities. The authors propose that integrating multiple modalities enhances classification performance, achieving a best model accuracy of 28%, significantly above the random baseline of 11%. Experiments demonstrate that combining modalities with FEAST enhances performance in flavor prediction tasks, introducing flavor as a new perceptive modality for representation learning. The study acknowledges limitations such as potential biases in data sources, particularly the predominance of Italian wines, and the subjective nature of taste influenced by participants' backgrounds. The authors encourage the research community to utilize the dataset and build upon the proposed baseline.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is unique and highly relevant, addressing the understudied modality of flavor in multimodal deep learning.
- The Napping methodology provides nuanced human flavor similarity judgments, supported by a large-scale study with 256 participants.
- The multimodal approach, integrating vision, language, and human annotations, is compelling and well-motivated.
- The integration of multiple modalities demonstrates a clear improvement in classification performance.
- The introduction of a novel task and a large dataset is valuable to the research community.

Weaknesses:
- The flavor representations learned by FEAST lack natural language descriptions, limiting interpretability.
- Prediction accuracy on attributes is low (20-30%), indicating that the learned representations may not adequately capture flavors.
- Coarse flavor predictions yield unsatisfactory results, with accuracy still needing improvement.
- The writing could be more polished, particularly in figure formatting and clarity of definitions.
- The dataset is limited to wine from Western culture, suggesting a need for broader cultural representation.
- The choice of a simple baseline model limits the demonstration of the dataset's potential and could benefit from more rigorous experimentation.
- Potential biases in the Vivino reviews, stemming from amateur enthusiasts, warrant discussion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the interpretability of flavor representations by incorporating natural language generation to explain the flavor spaces. Additionally, enhancing prediction accuracy on attributes should be prioritized, possibly through refining the flavor modeling and dataset quality. We suggest replacing the SVM classifier with a neural network for better performance on coarse flavor predictions, and exploring larger language models such as BART-large and better-performing models like FLAN-T5 and PEGASUS. Expanding the dataset to include a wider variety of drink types would enhance cultural diversity. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to enhance the discussion on limitations and future directions, particularly regarding the potential biases in the dataset and the implications of using pretrained models without fine-tuning. Lastly, we recommend tightening the writing and improving the formatting of figures and definitions for a more polished presentation.
