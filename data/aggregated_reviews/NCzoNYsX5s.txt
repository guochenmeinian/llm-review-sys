### Key Points
This paper presents MAFedHGL, a method designed to address imbalanced client data distributions and structural differences in heterogeneous graph learning. The core concept involves masking certain graph structures and node attributes during training, which enhances the model's ability to infer missing structures while maintaining semantic consistency. The authors introduce a clustering coefficient-based aggregation strategy that weights clients based on their node-to-neighbor connections, leading to improved feature representation and understanding across clients. The paper identifies three technical challenges—structural sensitivity, semantic complexity, and personalized federated aggregation—and proposes solutions that are technically sound. The experimental results demonstrate that MAFedHGL significantly outperforms 13 baseline methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem is well-motivated and the challenges are clearly identified and studied.
- MAFedHGL is technically robust and effectively addresses the identified challenges.
- The experimental design is comprehensive, and results indicate high effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- Claims of privacy preservation are questionable, as the paper does not adequately address potential data leakage through model gradients.
- The lack of necessary ablation analysis leaves the contributions of individual components unverified.
- Insufficient attention is given to computational and communication costs in federated learning.
- The paper does not analyze the time and space complexity of the proposed method.
- There is a lack of convergence analysis, which is essential in the field of Federated Learning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on privacy preservation by addressing potential data leakage through model gradients. Additionally, we suggest including necessary ablation studies to experimentally demonstrate the role of each component in the proposed method. It would be beneficial to analyze the computational and communication costs associated with MAFedHGL, as well as to provide a time and space complexity analysis. Finally, we encourage the authors to include a convergence analysis in the supplementary material to strengthen the theoretical foundation of their work.
