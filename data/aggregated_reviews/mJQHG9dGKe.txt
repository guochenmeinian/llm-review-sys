### Key Points
This paper presents a meta-learning based graph neural network (GNN) model designed to simulate the dynamics of material systems, such as the deformation behavior of a plate over time. The authors propose a Bayesian meta-learning approach that enables the GNN to quickly learn new tasks by leveraging knowledge from a wide range of prior tasks. Additionally, the paper introduces Probabilistic Dynamic Movement Primitives (ProDMPs) to mitigate the accumulation of errors typical in autoregressive neural simulators, allowing for a more efficient trajectory prediction.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The authors effectively explain the modeling approach of LTSGNS in a step-by-step manner, making it accessible to a broader audience with minimal prior knowledge. The results indicate that the proposed method may outperform MGN, even when conditioned on material properties. The use of ProDMPs to predict entire trajectories in a single step is a significant contribution that could enhance scalability in training.

Weaknesses:  
Concerns arise regarding the experimental evaluation, particularly the lack of rigorous support for claims about error mitigation through ProDMPs. The current experimental setup limits applicability by focusing on randomly sampled simulation states rather than initial conditions. Additionally, the interpretation of figures comparing LTSGNS with MGN is unclear, and the absence of an ablation study without the ProDMP component raises questions about its benefits.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including a mathematical description of ProDMPs in the main text to enhance self-containment. Additionally, addressing the limitations of the experimental evaluation is crucial; specifically, we suggest providing a more rigorous assessment of rollout stability, such as plots of MSE over time and the percentage of stable runs. An ablation study of LTSGNS without the ProDMP component would also be beneficial to clarify the advantages of incorporating ProDMPs. Finally, clarifying the interpretation of figures 3 and 4 in the context of the problem formulation would strengthen the paper's contributions.
