### Key Points
This paper studies COVID-19 vaccine misinformation in Brazil, Indonesia, and Nigeria, presenting a new dataset of tweets labeled for misinformation and its themes. The authors trained models to predict misinformation and its themes, achieving strong performance through techniques like pre-training on domain-specific tweets and data augmentation with GPT-3. They analyzed approximately 19 million tweets, measuring the impact of COVID-19 case rates on misinformation and observing differences in language across countries.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study includes a new, richly labeled dataset with high inter-annotator agreement.
- The models demonstrate strong performance, incorporating effective techniques to surpass baseline results.
- The research addresses a significant gap in literature by focusing on middle-income countries.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset is relatively small, with only 3,011 COVID-related tweets and limited representation of some misinformation themes.
- Evaluation results lack confidence intervals, which are crucial given the small data size.
- The analysis section presents unclear takeaways, with small and inconsistent effect sizes across countries.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset by increasing the number of labeled tweets, particularly for underrepresented themes. Additionally, they should include confidence intervals in Section 4.5 to enhance evaluation robustness. It would be beneficial to provide evaluation results per country to assess model performance variations. We also suggest rephrasing claims regarding the causal effect of COVID-19 case rates on misinformation, emphasizing correlation rather than causation, and considering potential confounders in their analysis. Lastly, clarifying the process of identifying additional tweets for the final annotated dataset would enhance transparency.
