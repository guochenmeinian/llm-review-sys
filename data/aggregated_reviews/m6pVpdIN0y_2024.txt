Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the significance of second-order information, particularly the Hessian structure, in sharpness-aware minimization and optimization methods involving gradient penalties. The authors identify the Nonlinear Modeling Error (NME) as a critical component that influences the performance of these methods. Through both theoretical and empirical analyses, the study reveals that the NME affects the sensitivity of gradient penalties to activation functions and highlights the differences in regularization performance between gradient penalties and weight noise.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work provides a novel conclusion regarding the overlooked NME's role in explaining the performance discrepancies of gradient and Hessian penalties, contributing to a deeper understanding of second-order information in optimization.
- The theoretical analysis is clear, and the empirical results substantiate the theoretical findings.
- The paper is well-written and addresses an important topic in sharpness learning, offering valuable insights into the implications of activation functions on Hessian penalties.

Weaknesses:
- The empirical results are limited to ResNets, raising questions about the generalizability of the findings across different model architectures, such as simpler models (FCN/LR) or more complex ones (Transformers).
- The manuscript presents a mixed message regarding the utility of second-order information, particularly in the context of Hessian penalties.
- The work lacks explicit demonstrations on how to improve or design better second-order-based methods, which could strengthen the conclusions drawn.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical analysis by including a broader range of model architectures to assess the generalizability of their findings. Additionally, we suggest providing clearer demonstrations regarding the off-diagonal elements of the NME and their potential impact. It would also be beneficial to express the theoretical analysis in a more formal style and clarify the definition of the trace operator to avoid confusion. Finally, addressing the limitations of the study and discussing potential societal impacts would enhance the manuscript's comprehensiveness.
