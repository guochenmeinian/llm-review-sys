### Key Points
This paper presents a detailed algorithm for detecting myocardial infarctions (MI) from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, utilizing asymmetric Morelet filters for cross-correlation analysis. The authors introduce a granular breakdown of sub-groups into binary, coarse, and fine categories. Additionally, they propose an expert-interpretable program for MI localization using neurosymbolic learning algorithms, developed with expert input. The paper offers a novel perspective in a field predominantly focused on deep learning techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The use of asymmetric Morelet filters is practical for cross-correlation analysis.  
- The granularity of the sub-group breakdown enhances the study's depth.  
- The incorporation of expert input in developing the domain-specific language adds credibility.  
- The paper presents a novel approach to MI detection, contributing to the existing literature.

Weaknesses:  
- Leave-one-out cross-validation was not considered despite a large sample size of over 20k.  
- The patient demographic includes many with cardiovascular pathologies; the implications of using a dataset with patients free of such diseases are unclear.  
- The performance of XGBoost was unexpectedly low, raising questions about its suitability; the potential effectiveness of AdaBoost was not explored.  
- Empirical evaluation is weak, relying on basic baselines without comparison to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical evaluation by comparing their results against state-of-the-art methods to strengthen their claims. Additionally, addressing the choice of cross-validation method, particularly the consideration of leave-one-out cross-validation, would enhance the robustness of their classification results. The authors should also discuss the expected outcomes if the dataset were to include patients without cardiovascular diseases. Finally, exploring the performance of AdaBoost in comparison to XGBoost could provide valuable insights into model selection.
