Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new Noisy Ostracods dataset aimed at genus and species classification of crustacean ostracods, featuring annotations from specialists. The dataset addresses challenges such as label noise, feature errors, and class imbalance, making it a valuable resource for benchmarking robust machine learning methods. The authors evaluated several popular baselines for label noise learning, contributing to the understanding of how these methods perform in real-world scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The dataset includes real-world images and presents a challenging classification task.
2. The authors successfully addressed assumptions regarding label noise and class imbalance.
3. A variety of popular baselines for robust learning have been evaluated.
4. The data collection pipeline is thoroughly documented.

Weaknesses:
1. The number of methods used for benchmarking is limited compared to recent studies.
2. The GitHub repository link was initially broken, affecting accessibility.
3. The methods compared are somewhat dated, with the latest being five years old.
4. The dataset may not serve as a benchmark for general image classification algorithms due to its specific focus.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the benchmarking section by including a broader range of label correction methods, particularly those from AQuA. Additionally, please ensure that the GitHub repository is well-organized and accessible, allowing for easier collaboration and reproducibility. We suggest proofreading the manuscript to correct minor typos and enhancing the discussion around the dataset's unique properties. Finally, consider exploring other applications, such as unsupervised anomaly detection, to broaden the dataset's utility.
