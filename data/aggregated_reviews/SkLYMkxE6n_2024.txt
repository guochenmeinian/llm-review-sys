### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the alignment between human brain representations and the latent space of a generative model, specifically focusing on emotional valence. The authors explore whether linear and nonlinear mappings between the VDVAE model's latent space and fMRI data can effectively capture emotional valence and assess the effects of perturbations in relevant dimensions across both systems. Key findings indicate that the VDVAE latent space aligns well with fMRI responses, with linear mappings performing comparably or better than nonlinear methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- **Novelty**: The study introduces a unique intersection of machine learning and cognitive neuroscience, particularly in its focus on emotional valence.
- **Methodological Rigor**: The use of high-resolution 7T fMRI data and extensive visual stimuli enhances the robustness of the findings.
- **Cross-Subject Alignment**: The significant improvement in cognitive alignment through inter-subject data alignment is a noteworthy contribution.
- **Clinical Implications**: The findings have potential applications in understanding and treating mood disorders.

Weaknesses:
- **Representation vs. Reconstruction**: The claim that latent space can retrieve cognitive properties through emotional valence scores is unclear, particularly regarding identity mapping.
- **Reproducibility**: Lack of details on the VAE architecture and absence of code hinder reproducibility; an Experiment Settings Section in the appendix is needed.
- **Limited Model Exploration**: The focus on VDVAE without comparison to other generative models limits the generalizability of the conclusions.
- **AI-Generated Labels**: Emotional valence labels being AI-generated may weaken the results, necessitating clearer visibility and discussion.
- **Small Effect Sizes**: The relatively small effect sizes of perturbations warrant further discussion and visibility in the abstract.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity on how emotional valence scores relate to identity mapping and address the potential confusion regarding representation versus reconstruction. To enhance reproducibility, please include an Experiment Settings Section in the appendix detailing the VAE architecture and provide access to the code. We suggest expanding the exploration of different generative models beyond VDVAE to strengthen the claims regarding cognitive alignment. Additionally, please clarify the implications of using AI-generated emotional valence labels and discuss the small effect sizes of perturbations more thoroughly, potentially including this in the abstract.
