Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a "partial guidance" approach for face restoration that directly models the distribution properties of high-quality images, avoiding assumptions about the degradation process. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this method through extensive experiments, showcasing its adaptability to various degradation scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method diverges from traditional degradation modeling by focusing on high-quality image properties, which serves as effective diffusion guidance.
- The experiments are comprehensive, providing solid comparisons with various baseline approaches.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks quantitative evaluations, particularly regarding identity preservation in face restoration, which raises concerns about potential degradation in identity.
- There is insufficient discussion on the technical contributions compared to existing methods like classifier guidance and DifFace, as well as the selection of properties for different tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the manuscript by including a quantitative evaluation of identity preservation in face restoration. Additionally, we suggest conducting an ablation study to clarify how properties are chosen for different tasks and to provide a fair quantitative comparison against commonly used datasets like CelebA-Test. Furthermore, including inference time comparisons with other methods and discussing failure cases would enhance understanding of the proposed method's limitations. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the technical differences between their approach and existing methods such as classifier guidance and DifFace.
