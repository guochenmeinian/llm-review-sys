### Key Points
This paper presents TSTTC, a large-scale dataset for Time-to-Contact (TTC) estimation in driving scenarios, containing over 200,000 sequences from real-world driving data and synthetic scenes generated using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). The authors propose two baseline methods for TTC estimation based on scale ratio estimation and conduct extensive experiments to validate the dataset and methods, highlighting the dataset's potential for advancing vision-based TTC estimation in autonomous driving applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is substantial and diverse, addressing a critical challenge in autonomous driving with a robust foundation for TTC estimation research.
- The innovative use of NeRF for data augmentation effectively fills gaps for rare scenarios, enhancing the dataset's applicability.
- The paper is well-written, clear, and includes thorough documentation, making the dataset readily usable.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset primarily focuses on cars and trucks, lacking representation of a wider range of road users, such as pedestrians and cyclists, which are crucial for Automated Emergency Braking (AEB) systems.
- The accuracy of TTC estimation may be compromised in scenarios involving elevation changes, which are critical for effective collision avoidance.
- Details regarding the NeRF algorithms and the evaluation of generated images with small TTC values are not adequately discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset by incorporating a wider variety of object categories, including vulnerable road users, to enhance its applicability in real-world scenarios. Additionally, developing and incorporating domain adaptation techniques could bridge the gap between synthetic NeRF-generated data and real-world data, improving model generalization. We suggest including a quality check process for dataset annotations to ensure reliability. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the unique significance of focusing solely on TTC estimation compared to 3D object detection and to address the limitations regarding elevation changes in TTC estimation scenarios. Lastly, we recommend including details about the NeRF scene generation pipeline to facilitate community engagement and further data generation.
