### Key Points
This paper presents M3H, a framework for classifying mental health symptoms in social media memes, alongside a new anxiety meme dataset (AxiOM). The authors propose a novel approach that integrates figurative reasoning and commonsense knowledge through a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method. The empirical results indicate that M3H outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, particularly in classification performance when figurative reasoning is incorporated. However, the work has significant technical limitations, including insufficient detail on the RAG implementation and a lack of clarity regarding the knowledge fusion mechanism.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The introduction of a novel dataset (AxiOM) validated by healthcare professionals contributes significantly to mental health research.  
- The methodology is well-structured, with a comprehensive experimental setup that enhances reproducibility.  
- The proposed approach demonstrates strong performance compared to baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of figurative reasoning in meme classification.  

Weaknesses:  
- There is insufficient technical detail on the RAG implementation, limiting the ability to evaluate its merits.  
- The knowledge fusion mechanism is unclear, and important architectural choices, such as the selection of BART as a backbone model, lack adequate justification.  
- The dataset construction and annotation processes are inadequately described, raising concerns about reproducibility and representativeness.  
- There is limited discussion of privacy implications and potential misuse scenarios related to the dataset.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the technical specifications of the RAG implementation, providing clarity on the choice of architecture and retrieval strategies. It is essential to include comparisons with recent state-of-the-art methods and conduct comprehensive ablation studies to justify architectural choices. Additionally, a more thorough discussion of privacy considerations and potential misuse scenarios should be included to enhance the paper's practical significance. Clarifying the dataset construction process, including the rationale for selected sources and the annotation methodology, will also strengthen the work. Finally, addressing ethical considerations, such as obtaining IRB approval for the data annotation process, is crucial given the sensitive nature of the content.
