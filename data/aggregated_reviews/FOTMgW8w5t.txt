Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a covariate-adjusted response-adaptive (CARA) design for clinical trials that addresses the challenge of delayed outcomes and utilizes surrogate outcomes for efficient estimation of average treatment effects (ATE). The authors propose an adaptive randomization method that minimizes the semiparametric efficiency bound, demonstrating its effectiveness through theoretical analyses and synthetic experiments, particularly in the context of an HIV study. Additionally, the paper discusses the variance claims associated with the estimation of treatment effects using inverse probability weighting (IPW) and augmented inverse probability weighting (AIPW). The authors clarify that the outcome model can achieve \(O(N^{-1/2})\) convergence due to bounded moment conditions, while the propensity score modeling requires only \(o_p(1)\) convergence. They emphasize that the asymptotic minimal variance is primarily derived from the outcome model estimation and address the definition of \(D^\star\) and the implications of finite support for delay distributions, asserting that all three methods discussed are asymptotically unbiased.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The problem of delayed outcomes is well-motivated, and the CARA design effectively modifies treatment allocation over time.
2. The authors provide a semiparametric efficient estimator for ATE, showing convergence to an oracle design.
3. The inclusion of a synthetic HIV trial illustrates the practical application and efficiency gains of the proposed design.
4. The authors provide a clear mathematical framework supporting their variance claims.
5. They effectively clarify the definition of \(D^\star\) and its relevance to delay distributions.
6. The paper demonstrates a solid understanding of asymptotic properties and variance reduction.

Weaknesses:  
1. The presentation lacks clarity in several sections, particularly in explaining the efficient influence function (EIF) and variance bounds in Section 3, and the design steps in Section 4.
2. Empirical results are missing error bars, which are crucial for supporting claims about bias and variance in comparison to complete randomization.
3. The paper primarily focuses on asymptotic results without sufficient finite sample analysis, which is important given the sample-starved nature of many experimental designs.
4. There is some ambiguity in the presentation of the finite sample bias, particularly regarding the interpretation of Figure 2A.
5. The authors' claims about the proposed method's bias properties relative to complete randomization may be misleading without proper clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation, especially in Section 3 by better motivating the introduction of EIF and variance bounds. In Section 4, more detailed explanations of the design steps should be provided to clarify how efficiency is improved. Additionally, we suggest including error bars in the empirical results to better illustrate variation and support claims regarding bias and variance. A finite sample analysis would also enhance the robustness of the findings. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the finite sample bias discussion, particularly in relation to Figure 2A, to avoid misinterpretation of the proposed method's properties. Lastly, we suggest revising the wording on lines 292-293 to accurately reflect the confidence intervals presented, ensuring that it does not imply superior bias properties of the proposed method over complete randomization.
