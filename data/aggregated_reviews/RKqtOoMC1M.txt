Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a multilingual approach to kNN-based NMT aimed at enhancing translation quality for low-resource languages. The authors propose augmenting a multilingual NMT model with datastores of related and unrelated languages, demonstrating improvements in low-resource translation quality, albeit with a tradeoff between quality and speed. The experiments indicate significant enhancements in BLEU scores, particularly for low-resource languages, and include a latency analysis of the inference stage.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The idea is clear and straightforward, with solid motivation.
- The method is simple yet effective, resulting in substantial improvements across different languages.
- Comprehensive experiments and detailed analysis support the claims made.
- The paper is well written, and the authors plan to release the code upon publication.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed approach is somewhat complicated, potentially making it difficult for others to follow.
- The improvement in cross-lingual mapping is relatively minor (0.3 BLEU), and the innovation may not be strong enough.
- The paper lacks results for en->xx translations, which could differ from xx->en results.
- There should be a baseline comparison with a native multilingual datastore.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by simplifying the explanation of the proposed approach to enhance accessibility for readers. Additionally, we suggest including en->xx results to provide a more comprehensive analysis of the translation performance. Furthermore, establishing a baseline comparison with a native multilingual datastore would strengthen the contribution of the work. Lastly, addressing minor typographical issues, such as correcting "a first attempt" to "the first attempt" and ensuring proper spacing in specified lines, would enhance the overall presentation.
