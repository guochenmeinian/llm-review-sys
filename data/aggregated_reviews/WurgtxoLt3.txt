### Key Points
This paper presents a novel defense-based framework for fake news detection that leverages competing veracities to enhance interpretability. The authors propose using large language models (LLMs) to generate explanations, which facilitates timely debunking. However, significant challenges remain regarding the veracity of reasoning produced by LLMs, as their training data sources are uncertain. The framework aims to address majority bias but lacks clarity on measurement and mitigation strategies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method effectively utilizes recent LLMs without resorting to an all-in-LLM solution, demonstrating a reasonable design.
- The analysis is comprehensive, well-organized, and reader-friendly, contributing to the overall quality of writing.

Weaknesses:
- The claim that existing explainable fake news detection methods lead to majority bias is unconvincing, lacking clear evidence.
- The relevant work section could benefit from citing older literature to enhance comprehensiveness.
- Details regarding annotator quality and compensation are insufficiently addressed.
- The framework's reliance on competing evidence may limit its applicability in cases without such evidence.
- Presentation issues, including minor grammatical errors and unclear references, need correction.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the claim regarding majority bias in existing methods and provide clearer evidence to support it. Additionally, we suggest expanding the relevant work section to include older studies, such as those by Jin et al. (2016), to provide a more comprehensive literature review. Clarifying the details about annotator quality and compensation is essential for transparency. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of the framework concerning claims without competing evidence would strengthen the paper. Finally, we encourage the authors to revise the presentation for grammatical accuracy and clarity, particularly in Table 7 and other specified areas.
