Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents theoretical results characterizing the generalization capabilities of Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (WDRO) methods. The authors demonstrate that the radius scaling of \(1/\sqrt{n}\) allows for generalization bounds that do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality, applicable to both constrained and regularized versions of WDRO. The theoretical analysis is supported by examples, and the authors provide a proof sketch elucidating the techniques used.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The theoretical contribution is significant, proving that the empirical robust loss can dominate the true loss without being affected by the curse of dimensionality.  
- The paper includes a novel proof technique based on concentration bounds for the dual problem, which is of independent interest.  
- The writing is generally clear, with necessary backgrounds and detailed explanations accompanying theorems.  

Weaknesses:  
- The contribution relative to the state of the art is inadequately described, particularly regarding the extension to non-linear models.  
- The writing could be improved, with specific suggestions including punctuation corrections and clearer organization of the introduction.  
- The analysis is limited to quadratic cost functions, which may restrict applicability; further discussion on the challenges of extending to general \(p\)-th power norms is needed.  
- Some literature is missing, particularly regarding the benefits of entropic regularization in WDRO.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the description of their contribution relative to existing works, especially regarding the scaling \(1/\sqrt{n}\) for non-linear models. Additionally, we suggest including more complex parametric models in Section 3.4 to validate the main assumptions. The authors should also address the limitations of their analysis and provide examples where the assumptions do not hold, which could motivate future research directions. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to enhance the clarity of the writing by addressing the specific punctuation and organization issues noted in the reviews. Lastly, it would be beneficial to include numerical results and explore practical choices for the radius that yield small errors and performance guarantees.
