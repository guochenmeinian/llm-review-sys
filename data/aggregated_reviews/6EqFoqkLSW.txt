Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents methods for identifying causal structures in discrete latent variable models using a novel tool termed the *tensor rank condition*, which connects rank constraints and d-separation relations. The authors establish connections between the d-separation of observed variables and the tensor rank of random variables, proposing an algorithm that learns both the measurement model and the structure model up to Markov equivalence class. They argue that their method is statistically robust and can identify causal structures even with only two pure children required for each latent variable, under the assumption of three pure children per latent variable. The approach is validated through simulations and addresses the identification of discrete latent variable models, although it relies on the existence of a mixture oracle, which poses challenges in estimation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of the tensor rank condition is a significant and innovative contribution that effectively connects algebraic constraints with d-separation relations in discrete causal models.
2. The proposed algorithm is simple yet effective, extending the identification bounds of discrete latent variable models and offering a statistically robust approach for identifying causal structures.
3. The ability to identify the measurement model with only two pure children is a notable advancement.

Weaknesses:
1. The structural assumptions, particularly the purity assumption and the three-pure child assumption, are quite restrictive and not convincingly justified, limiting the applicability of the results.
2. The reliance on the mixture oracle for identification raises concerns about practical implementation and the challenges associated with its estimation.
3. The paper does not adequately address how the assumptions impact practical scenarios, particularly regarding the faithfulness assumption, and there are concerns about the novelty of the results compared to existing literature, particularly regarding similar works that operate under weaker assumptions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the structural assumptions, particularly the three-pure child assumption, and discuss its implications more thoroughly. Additionally, addressing the limitations of the purity assumption and exploring partial results for cases where this assumption is violated would strengthen the paper. We suggest clarifying the relationship between the tensor rank condition and existing methods, particularly in comparison to works that may have weaker assumptions. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to improve clarity regarding the practical implications of relying on the mixture oracle and to articulate how their method's robustness under stronger assumptions differentiates it from prior work. Enhancing the flow and clarity of the writing, especially in sections discussing assumptions and limitations, would benefit the overall presentation. Finally, we encourage the authors to include more detailed discussions on the implications of their findings in practical applications and to consider testing their method with varying numbers of children per latent variable.
