### Key Points
This paper presents Arctique, a synthetic dataset modeled after histopathological colon images, aimed at advancing uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques. The authors argue that real medical imaging datasets often exhibit uncertainty due to label and imaging noise, making a synthetic dataset valuable for evaluation. The dataset is designed to benchmark UQ methods by controlling for uncertainty in images and labels.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The benchmark dataset closely resembles real-world data and includes ground-truth annotations, evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively.
- The dataset generation code is publicly available, allowing for user adaptation.
- The evaluation strategy, including zero-shot generalization, is clear and insightful.
- The paper is well-written and organized, making it easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The title may appear overly general given the specific focus on image segmentation, which could limit applicability to other image analysis tasks.
- The uncertainty quantification methods evaluated are somewhat outdated; recent literature could provide better-performing alternatives.
- The paper lacks novelty, analysis, and extensive ablations, and there is no visualization comparison between different methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors consider narrowing the scope of the topic to align the title more closely with the content. Additionally, we suggest addressing formatting inconsistencies in figure citations and clarifying the phrase "all three tasks" on line 210, which may be a typo. To enhance the work, we encourage the authors to discuss more recent uncertainty quantification methods as potential baselines and consider releasing the full pretrained data along with the pretrained model to foster further research. Lastly, we advise including visual comparisons between different methods to strengthen the analysis.
