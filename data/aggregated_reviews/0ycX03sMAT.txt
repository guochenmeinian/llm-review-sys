Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical analysis of Federated Zeroth-Order Optimization (FedZO), establishing generalization error bounds under Lipschitz continuity and smoothness conditions. The authors develop techniques for both synchronous and asynchronous FedZO, refining bounds using heavy-tailed gradient noise and second-order Taylor expansion. The contributions include systematic assessments of FedZO and the introduction of the on-average model stability analysis technique.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and logically structured, making it easy to follow.
2. It provides the first generalization error bound for FedZO and refines these bounds, addressing a significant gap in the literature.
3. The theoretical results are comprehensive and may inspire further research in federated zeroth-order optimization.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks experimental analysis to validate the theoretical findings, which may limit its practical relevance.
2. Some assumptions and results are not well-justified, particularly regarding the impact of heterogeneous data distribution across clients.
3. Clarifications are needed on specific technical terms and assumptions, such as the definition of "heavy-tailed" and the implications of certain conditions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including empirical evaluations to validate their theoretical results, particularly comparing synchronous and asynchronous FedZO. Additionally, providing more motivation for studying zeroth-order optimization in federated learning and clarifying the implications of assumptions, such as the PL condition and "heavy-tailed" terminology, would enhance the paper's clarity and relevance. Furthermore, addressing the impact of data heterogeneity in their analysis would strengthen the theoretical contributions.
