Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper explores dataset biases and introduces a framework to identify unique visual attributes that differentiate various datasets. The authors analyze inter-dataset biases among YFCC, CC, and DataComp, evaluating how semantic and structural attributes contribute to these biases. The method involves applying transformations to extract various types of information from datasets, providing insights into the fundamental gaps in understanding large-scale image-text datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. A diverse range of transformations was considered for this study.
2. The paper provides a comprehensive analysis to identify factors that distinguish datasets.
3. The writing is clear and the structure is well-organized.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper fails to discuss how the identified biases can be utilized to build more diverse and representative datasets in the future, which is a significant shortcoming.
2. There is no information on how the accuracy of pre-trained models affects the findings.
3. The investigation of biases is limited to individual attributes without exploring potential interactions among them, which may contribute to overall bias.
4. The proposed framework only includes bias metrics relative to YCD, neglecting intra-dataset biases that could affect the creation of a truly debiased dataset.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on how their findings can be applied to build more diverse and representative datasets. Specifically, they should:
- Include concrete suggestions for dataset curators on utilizing their framework to assess new images before integration.
- Discuss the impact of pre-trained model accuracy on their findings.
- Investigate the effects of different data transformation formats on their results, such as using segmentation masks or object detection boundaries.
- Consider combining multiple visual and semantic attributes in their analysis to explore joint contributions to bias.
- Clarify the task setting regarding the ideal debiased dataset in the introduction to enhance reader understanding.
