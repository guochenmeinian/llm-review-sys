### Key Points
This paper presents a new Hebrew dataset, HeQ, for the Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) task, created through a rigorous crowdsourcing protocol to ensure quality. HeQ includes a broader domain of news compared to its counterpart, ParaShoot, and introduces a hybrid evaluation metric, TLNLS, which accommodates the morphological richness of Hebrew. The authors conduct various experiments to demonstrate the dataset's effectiveness and the performance of baseline models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed benchmark is valuable for the MRC community, particularly for low-resource languages.
- The dataset quality is high, with detailed data curation and manual verification.
- The motivation for the dataset and the new evaluation metric is clearly articulated.

Weaknesses:
- The generalization ability of the TLNLS metric to other morphological-rich languages is questionable.
- The paper lacks sufficient details regarding the dataset, such as final statistics and the process for obtaining answers.
- The proposed evaluation metric has not been validated by human assessments, raising concerns about model performance evaluation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the dataset description by providing final statistics and details on how answers were annotated. Additionally, we suggest including a quantification of dataset diversity and conducting error analysis for the TLNLS metric to identify its limitations. It would also be beneficial to enhance the comparison with the ParaShoot dataset, detailing how HeQ addresses its shortcomings. Furthermore, we advise addressing the lack of human evaluation for the TLNLS metric to bolster trust in the assessment of model performance.
