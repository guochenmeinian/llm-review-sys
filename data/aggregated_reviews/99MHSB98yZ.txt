Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a conditional latent diffusion model (LDM) for generating oriented BEV vehicle bounding boxes, each associated with a 4-second trajectory. The model incorporates an autoencoder for encoding and a diffusion model that can be conditioned on various parameters, including local maps and agent attributes. The authors validate their approach on both an internal dataset and the Argoverse 2 dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness and flexibility for controllable generation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The application of latent diffusion to driving scenario generation is novel and shows potential for generative tasks.
- The token conditioning mechanism enhances controllability and customization.
- The writing and presentation are generally clear and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- There is no comparison with existing works, making it difficult to assess the proposed method's superiority. Quantitative comparisons with methods such as SceneGen, TrafficGen, and others are necessary.
- The evaluation metrics for generated scenarios are limited, focusing only on off-road trajectories without considering collisions, smoothness, or traffic rule adherence.
- The model's ability to capture agent relationships is questioned, as it lacks specific designs for interactions compared to GNN-based methods.
- The claimed controllability of the model is not sufficiently evaluated, and additional experiments are needed to demonstrate its effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including quantitative comparisons with existing methods to validate the proposed approach. Additionally, the evaluation metrics should be expanded to include collision rates, trajectory smoothness, and adherence to traffic rules. We suggest exploring the use of auto-regressive methods within the framework to enhance agent relationship modeling. Furthermore, conducting experiments to demonstrate the model's controllability and its performance on downstream tasks, such as motion forecasting, would significantly strengthen the paper. Lastly, clarifying the nature of the conditioning tokens and their specifications would help address existing confusion.
