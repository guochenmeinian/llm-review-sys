### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) by leveraging external evidence. The authors decompose claims into subclaims using GPT-3.5, retrieve relevant documents via the Bing Search API, and assess the veracity of subclaims with an NLI model (DeBERTa-v3). They implement a stop-or-continue strategy based on Bayesian risk decision-making. Experimental results indicate that detection accuracy improves significantly with fewer retrieved documents.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed Bayesian sequential analysis for hallucination detection is novel.  
- The paper is well-written and provides a solid introduction to the methodologies.  
- Experimental results are promising, demonstrating good accuracy with fewer document retrievals.  

Weaknesses:  
- The complexity of the method may hinder reproducibility, as it relies on multiple advanced models and is sensitive to key hyper-parameters like $C_M$ and $C_{FA}$.  
- The entailment scores are derived from another deep learning model, which may not be reliable without expert annotations.  
- The literature review in Section 2.1 is weak, lacking recent works and intuitive baselines, such as querying ChatGPT for hallucination detection.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison of detection times with alternative approaches to assess efficiency. Additionally, the authors should clarify the reliability of DeBERTa-v3-NLI for their task with expert annotations. Expanding the literature review in Section 2.1 to include more recent works and adding intuitive baselines would strengthen the paper. Finally, addressing the sensitivity of key hyper-parameters would enhance the reproducibility of the method.
