Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a dimensionality reduction approach utilizing a tree of local PCA projections, contributing a mathematical framework, an optimization algorithm with pseudocode, and empirical evidence from experiments on benchmark datasets. The authors propose a method that combines the advantages of PCA with a hierarchical structure, enabling effective data exploration and visualization. The experimental results validate claims regarding scalability, computational complexity, and reconstruction error, particularly illustrated through the Fashion MNIST dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and addresses a significant problem in data visualization, merging the benefits of PCA with a hierarchical framework for better interpretability and computational efficiency compared to methods like UMAP or t-SNE.
2. The related work is succinctly presented, clearly distinguishing the novelty of the proposed method against existing dimensionality reduction techniques.
3. The mathematical formulation is clear, with proofs demonstrating the optimization's favorable properties, including parallelism and computational efficiency.
4. The experimental results are well-articulated, confirming the optimization algorithm's effectiveness across various datasets.
5. Although no code is provided, the detailed experimental descriptions allow for reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks guidance on setting several hyperparameters, particularly $\lambda$ and $\Delta$, and does not address the sensitivity of the approach to these values.
2. The current method constructs a full tree to depth $\Delta$, but deeper trees in specific regions could enhance performance, as evidenced by the examples in Figure 4.
3. There is insufficient detail regarding the parameter settings used for comparisons with t-SNE and UMAP.
4. The visualization quality of PCA trees may be challenging for analysts to interpret due to the complex hierarchical partitions and varying projections.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on hyperparameter settings, including how to set $\lambda$ and $\Delta$, and the sensitivity of the approach to these parameters. Additionally, consider allowing for deeper trees in specific regions based on data characteristics to enhance the method's performance. It would also be beneficial to provide clarity on the parameter settings used in experiments with t-SNE and UMAP. Lastly, we suggest exploring the integration of graph-based similarity approaches with the proposed method to potentially unify the exploration of local structures.
