### Key Points
This paper presents DeltaScore, an unsupervised metric for evaluating story generation that measures the likelihood difference between generated stories and their perturbed versions using pre-trained language models (PLMs). The authors propose multiple perturbation methods targeting five evaluation aspects: fluency, coherence, relatedness, logicality, and interestingness. The evaluation shows that while most perturbations do not consistently enhance correlations with human judgments, three methods improve all aspects. The study includes comprehensive experiments across various PLM backbones and compares DeltaScore with existing metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Thorough analysis with extensive testing across five domains and multiple perturbation methods.
- The methods are simple yet effective, and the paper is well-written with effective figures and tables.
- The evaluation procedure utilizes separate human ratings for parameter choices and full comparisons.

Weaknesses:
- Lack of clarity regarding the quality of the perturbed data and validation of perturbation outputs.
- Insufficient intuition on the connection between perturbation-based evaluation and model mechanisms or human evaluation.
- Some perturbation parameters and their meanings are not clearly defined, leading to potential confusion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the validation of the quality of perturbation outputs to ensure reliability. Further clarification on the selection process for characters or words in perturbation methods is necessary. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion on the usefulness of the perturbation-based method and its connection to human evaluation. It would also be beneficial to provide a table of dataset statistics and consider presenting certain figures as tables for better clarity.
