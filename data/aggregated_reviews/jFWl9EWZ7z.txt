Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents D-LISA, a two-stage framework for multi-object 3D grounding that includes three innovative components: a dynamic box proposal module, a dynamic multi-view renderer, and a language-informed spatial fusion module. The authors demonstrate that D-LISA outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 12.8% in multi-object 3D grounding and achieves competitive results in single-object tasks. The method effectively addresses the challenges of variable proposal selection and optimized viewing angles based on scene context.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method shows state-of-the-art performance in multi-object and single-object 3D grounding tasks.
- Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted, clearly illustrating the performance improvements from each modification.
- The paper is well-written, with clear implementation and evaluation details.

Weaknesses:
- The time and memory complexity of the proposed methods, particularly the multi-view rendering step, appear substantial; a complexity comparison with baseline methods would be beneficial.
- The novelty of the dynamic vision module and the LISA module is questioned, as they seem to rely on established techniques rather than introducing significant innovations.
- The paper lacks detailed motivations for certain design choices, such as the camera pose offset prediction and the effectiveness of the LISA module compared to existing methods.
- The analysis of dynamic pose distribution and the impact of NMS on performance are insufficiently addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the core issues targeted by the paper in the abstract and introduction. A more detailed ablation study isolating the contributions of each dynamic component would enhance understanding. Additionally, including a complexity comparison with baseline methods and addressing the questions regarding the novelty of the dynamic vision module and LISA module would strengthen the paper. Lastly, clarifying the effects of NMS and providing more insights into the dynamic pose distribution analysis would be beneficial.
