Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC), revealing its shortcomings due to a lack of stochasticity and meaningful partial observability. The authors demonstrate that "open-loop" agents can perform comparably to "closed-loop" agents in certain scenarios. To address these issues, they propose SMACv2, which introduces randomized starting positions and enhanced partial observability, showing that open-loop policies struggle to achieve high rewards in this new environment. The study evaluates the QMIX and MAPPO algorithms on SMACv2, confirming the increased difficulty and effectiveness of the new benchmark.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- Uncovers a fundamental issue in a widely used MARL benchmark.  
- Proposes a solution that effectively addresses the identified flaws.  
- Provides clear experimental evidence supporting the proposed changes.  
- Introduces an extended partial observability challenge that encourages agent communication, opening avenues for further research.  

Weaknesses:  
- Limited discussion on the implications of relying on a single benchmark environment.  
- Some sections, such as Feature Inferrability and Relevance, lack clarity and detail.  
- The evaluation of only MAPPO and QMIX does not provide a comprehensive view of other MARL approaches.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the conclusion by including a broader discussion on the necessity for diverse benchmark environments in RL/MARL research to mitigate the risks of undetected flaws. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the clarity of the Feature Inferrability and Relevance sections by providing detailed results for each mask and clearly distinguishing different mask conditions in figures. It would be beneficial to consistently use the "Root-mean-squared error as a proportion of mean Q value" metric when comparing SMAC and SMACv2. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to identify relevant sections or tables when referring to the Appendix for easier navigation. Lastly, including potential negative societal impacts would strengthen the paper's discussion on ethical considerations.
