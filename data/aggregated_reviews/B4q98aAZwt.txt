Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a sample-efficient molecular optimization method called Genetic-guided GFlowNets (Genetic GFN), which integrates domain-specific genetic algorithms to guide GFlowNet policies toward higher-reward molecular samples. The authors demonstrate its effectiveness in generating inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 and achieving state-of-the-art performance on the PMO benchmark across 23 tasks. The method's ability to control the score-diversity trade-off via the inverse temperature parameter is highlighted, although some other methods also possess this feature.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method effectively computes sample efficiency and outperforms state-of-the-art techniques with a well-motivated strategy.
- The integration of genetic algorithms allows for better navigation of chemical space, leveraging GFlowNets' ability to generate diverse molecules.
- The paper is well-organized, pedagogical, and includes comprehensive experimental results, demonstrating potential real-world impact.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty is limited as the Genetic GFN combines existing techniques without introducing new genetic operators specific to domain knowledge.
- The lack of accessible code raises concerns about reproducibility and the validity of the results.
- Insufficient discussion on hyperparameter sensitivity, computational complexity, and the performance scaling with molecular size and complexity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the self-containment of the paper by including a visualization of the mutation and crossover steps of the genetic algorithm. Additionally, providing a schematic diagram of the entire training process would enhance clarity. A discussion on hyperparameter sensitivity and computational complexity should be included, as well as more qualitative results to illustrate the generated molecules' trajectories. Finally, exploring the incorporation of grammar-based representations could strengthen the evidence supporting the proposed method's motivation.
