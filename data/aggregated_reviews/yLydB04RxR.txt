### Key Points
This paper presents a holistic analysis of cutting-edge reaction prediction models, introducing a new benchmark dataset, ChORISOv1, along with tailored splits to simulate chemically relevant scenarios. The authors provide several metrics to enhance model performance evaluation, revealing limitations in current models and evaluation protocols. The paper addresses the timely issue of out-of-distribution generalization in reaction prediction, filling a gap in established benchmarks for model generalization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The proposed ChORISOv1 features a high number of reactions, a significant ratio of C-C bond formation, and functional group interconversion. It also exhibits a heavier-tailed distribution of molecular weight and stereocenters in products. The introduction of regio- and stereo-accuracy metrics is particularly beneficial for assessing model performance regarding reactive site predictions.

Weaknesses:  
The benchmarking is limited to only two models, making it challenging to draw meaningful conclusions from the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the benchmarking by including additional models for comparison to strengthen the validity of their conclusions. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the copyright status of the dataset, particularly regarding its licensing and availability, as referenced in the README.md of the related GitHub repository.
