Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents RFold, an innovative approach for RNA secondary structure prediction that decouples the optimization process into row-wise and column-wise components. The authors utilize attention maps to learn pair-wise interactions of nucleotide bases instead of relying on hand-crafted features. The method demonstrates significant improvements in inference time and accuracy on multiple datasets, particularly the RNAStralign dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The use of attention maps as input and the application of U-Net for prediction yield interesting results, outperforming hand-crafted features.
- RFold achieves a dramatic reduction in inference time compared to existing methods.
- The results are validated across various datasets, showing strong performance and supported by visualizations and ablation studies.

Weaknesses:
- The generalization ability of RFold is limited, as it does not achieve the best recall on ArchiveII and bpRNA-TS0 datasets.
- The novelty of RFold is questioned, as it appears incremental over Ufold, with only minor architectural modifications.
- The paper lacks a section discussing limitations and does not adequately address the evaluation of pseudoknots.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalization ability of RFold by conducting experiments to demonstrate how strict constraints impact performance. Additionally, providing a more comprehensive comparison between RFold and Ufold, including their similarities and differences, would enhance clarity. The authors should also include a limitations section to address potential shortcomings and ensure a more cautious discussion of the method's generalization capabilities. Lastly, clarifying the inference time measurement setup and including architectural hyperparameters would strengthen the reproducibility of the results.
