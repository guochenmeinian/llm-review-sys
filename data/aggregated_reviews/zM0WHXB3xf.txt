### Key Points
This paper presents an enhancement to the Learning-to-Defer (L2D) framework by incorporating conformal prediction to quantify uncertainty in the rejector component. The rejector outputs uncertainty sets instead of binary deferral decisions, allowing for more flexible decision-making between human and machine. The approach is evaluated on the CIFAR-10 dataset, demonstrating improved performance in abstention and consensus prediction tasks compared to traditional methods. Additionally, the paper introduces the Beta Unit Hyper-Cube (BUC) kernel, designed for bounded domains in Bayesian optimization, addressing limitations in Gaussian processes with traditional kernels. The BUC kernel's theoretical and experimental work is solid, with significant implications for practical applications in optimization tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Novel integration of conformal prediction with the L2D framework.
- Strong theoretical foundation for uncertainty quantification.
- Demonstrates improved performance in deferral and consensus predictions.
- The BUC kernel fills a gap in Bayesian optimization for bounded domains.
- Well-justified theoretical framework for the BUC kernel, including bounds on information gain and regret.

Weaknesses:
- Limited evaluation to a single dataset (CIFAR-10).
- Could benefit from more visual aids for better clarity and accessibility.
- Experiments for the BUC kernel are not thorough enough; a broader range of real-world benchmarks is needed.
- Lacks discussion on practical guidelines for choosing parameters like the bandwidth $h$ for the BUC kernel.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including additional datasets beyond CIFAR-10 to assess the framework's performance on more complex or higher-dimensional data. The authors should also consider extending the conformal prediction-based rejector to more nuanced real-world decision-making scenarios, such as multi-expert systems. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of integrating conformal prediction into the L2D framework, particularly for real-time applications. Lastly, we encourage the authors to expand the range of benchmark tasks for the BUC kernel and include practical guidelines for selecting parameters like the bandwidth $h$.
