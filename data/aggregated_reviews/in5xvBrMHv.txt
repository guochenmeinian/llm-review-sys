Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a knowledge-enriched discrete diffusion model aimed at improving event schema induction by addressing challenges such as error propagation and data quality issues. The authors propose an instance graph expansion module to enhance knowledge coverage and an event skeleton generation module that predicts all nodes and links simultaneously. Empirical results indicate that the proposed method outperforms two baselines across three datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation and contributions of the paper are clear and relevant to the field.
- The integration of LLMs to enhance knowledge coverage is both simple and effective.
- The paper demonstrates improved performance on several benchmarks.

Weaknesses:
- The problem formulation in Section 2 is confusing and lacks clarity, particularly in defining the schema induction problem.
- Experimental details are insufficient, including dataset sizes and the need for unmodified results.
- The ChatGPT prompting methodology is inadequately explained, and the ablation study lacks depth.
- Some important baselines and metrics are missing, which affects the robustness of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the problem formulation in Section 2 by explicitly defining the schema induction problem and its concepts. Additionally, the authors should provide more detailed experimental settings, including dataset sizes and unmodified results, and consider releasing the modified data publicly. The ChatGPT prompting methodology needs a thorough explanation of the formats explored and the rationale for the chosen approach. We also suggest expanding the ablation study to include important submodules and conducting experiments across a variety of event scenarios to validate the robustness of the proposed method. Finally, addressing grammar issues and ensuring all evaluation metrics are discussed will enhance the paper's overall quality.
