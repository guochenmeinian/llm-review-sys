### Key Points
This paper presents a new dataset for Chinese fake news detection, named MCFEND, which includes 23,974 pieces of verified news from 14 fact-checking agencies. The authors address the limitations of existing datasets that rely solely on Weibo, highlighting the necessity of incorporating multi-source data to enhance model robustness. The study evaluates eight baseline models, demonstrating that models trained on traditional datasets do not generalize well to diverse sources. The authors also provide the dataset and code publicly for community use.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The MCFEND dataset fills a significant gap by providing a multi-source benchmark for Chinese fake news detection, improving model generalizability.
- The innovative dataset construction method, including cross-lingual identical news retrieval, effectively expands the scope of misinformation detection.
- Comprehensive experiments on various baseline models enhance understanding of their performance across different data sources.

Weaknesses:
- The concept of "source" is not clearly defined, leading to potential confusion regarding its meaning in the context of the dataset.
- Some experimental results are inconsistent, particularly regarding the Macro F1 scores of different models.
- The methodology lacks clarity on deduplication processes and the handling of text length, which may affect the context needed for accurate fake news detection.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the term "source" to specify whether it refers to platforms or fact-checking agencies. Additionally, we suggest providing a detailed explanation of the deduplication process and how longer texts are managed in the context of model training. It would also be beneficial to include a descriptive analysis of the differences in fake news from various sources, focusing on factors such as average length and topic distribution. Furthermore, we advise the authors to consider using UMAP instead of t-SNE for dimensionality reduction in their visualizations, as it may better preserve global structure.
