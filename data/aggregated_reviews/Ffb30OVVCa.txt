### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for generating high-resolution images from text prompts using pre-trained diffusion models, introducing several engineering tricks such as a cascading approach for guidance, a "Slider" mechanism for balancing detail and structure, and patch-based denoising to enable large image generation on a single GPU. The proposed method allows for images up to 32,768 x 32,768 pixels, demonstrating improved quality and efficiency compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The method achieves high-resolution image generation on a single GPU without additional training, addressing a significant limitation of current models.  
2. The Fourier space fusion effectively maintains fine-grained details and global structures while reducing artifacts.  
3. The approach is memory efficient, requiring only 7.4 GB of memory, making it accessible for the community.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The authors lack references or supporting experiments for claims regarding the imaginary part of the Fourier transform containing low-frequency information, which requires further justification.  
2. The presentation is poor, with unclear descriptions and a lengthy introduction that obscures key methods and experiments.  
3. Errors and mismatches in the experimental section, such as unclear definitions and contradictions in results, hinder understanding.  
4. Figures and illustrations, particularly Fig. 3, are difficult to interpret and need redesign for clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their presentation by restructuring the paper to emphasize the core concepts and methods more effectively. Additionally, providing deeper analysis or references to support the claims about the imaginary part of the Fourier transform is essential. We suggest redesigning Fig. 3 and ensuring that all figures clearly convey the intended information. Lastly, addressing the inconsistencies in the experimental results and clarifying terms such as "base model" in Table 2 will enhance the overall understanding of the paper.
