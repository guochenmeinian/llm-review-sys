Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents COSMIC, a simplified and efficient compression method for satellite earth observation images. The method addresses the challenges posed by the increasing volume of image data and limited computing power on satellites by designing a lightweight encoder that significantly reduces computation while achieving a high compression ratio. For ground-based decoding, COSMIC employs a diffusion-based model to enhance image quality, leveraging multi-modal satellite data such as coordinates and timestamps. Experimental results indicate that COSMIC outperforms existing methods in both perceptual quality and distortion metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The writing and presentation of the paper are excellent, with a clear and logical flow.
2. The authors provide substantial knowledge on deep learning-based image compression and diffusion models, making it accessible for readers outside the field.
3. The lightweight coding framework is of practical significance for satellite image compression.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks comprehensive performance comparisons with various models, particularly those discussed in Section 2.2 on deep learning-based remote sensing image compression.
2. The handling of metadata is inadequately explained, raising questions about its processing and alignment with satellite image data.
3. There is insufficient reporting on the spatiotemporal complexity of COSMIC compared to other methods to substantiate its lightweight architecture.
4. The reliance on a pre-trained stable diffusion model may limit performance under specific conditions, and the implications of power supply limitations on satellites are not thoroughly discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the performance comparison by including additional models from the literature, particularly those mentioned in Section 2.2. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the process of handling metadata, detailing how it is processed and aligned with the satellite image data. Additionally, we suggest that the authors report the spatiotemporal complexity of COSMIC relative to other methods to better demonstrate its lightweight architecture. Lastly, a more in-depth discussion on the power supply limitations of satellites and their impact on the proposed method would enhance the paper's comprehensiveness.
