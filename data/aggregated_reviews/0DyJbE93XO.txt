### Key Points
This paper presents a thorough investigation of dense retrieval in a zero-shot setting, identifying key factors that influence model performance, including the source query set, source document set, data scale, and bias in the target dataset. The authors conduct a detailed analysis of these variables and their impact on performance, highlighting the potential effects of bias on evaluation. The experimental evaluation is robust and provides valuable insights for future research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper fills a research gap by systematically analyzing dense retrieval in a zero-shot context.  
- The experiments are robust and provide substantial evidence supporting the findings.  
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written, enhancing accessibility for readers.  

Weaknesses:  
- The authors could have proposed new training strategies based on their insights rather than solely reviewing existing methods.  
- Given the recent advancements in pre-training-based dense retrieval models, the insights may not be as groundbreaking as they could have been previously.  
- Questions arise regarding the allocation of queries from NQ and positive samples from the MSMARCO document set, which may lead to queries lacking accurate answers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by proposing innovative training strategies derived from their analysis rather than just reviewing existing methods. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the allocation process of queries and samples to ensure that queries have accurate answers. Addressing these points could enhance the paper's relevance and impact in light of recent developments in the field.
