Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents BrainDIVE, a system for synthesizing optimal stimuli for specific regions of interest (ROIs) in the human visual cortex using a pretrained latent diffusion model combined with a brain encoder. The authors claim that their method captures semantic selectivity and identifies subtle differences in response properties within brain networks, validated through human evaluations. The approach allows for fine-grained analysis of visual preferences and highlights functional subdivisions within existing ROIs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
* The methodology effectively captures semantic selectivity and identifies functional distinctions within visual cortical regions.
* Extensive human evaluations provide validation for the qualitative observations made.
* The approach does not require retraining the diffusion model, which is a notable advantage over previous methods.

Weaknesses:
* The method lacks technical depth and relies on heuristic approaches, with insufficient theoretical analysis.
* The novelty of the technique is overstated, as it does not adequately acknowledge prior studies that have attempted similar tasks.
* The experimental results are based on a small dataset of only 10 subjects, raising concerns about generalizability and reliability.
* Clarity in the methodology is lacking, particularly regarding the diffusion model architecture and the role of the brain encoder.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology section by providing detailed explanations of key components, such as the diffusion model architecture and the brain-guided synthesis process. Additionally, we suggest that the authors conduct more extensive comparisons with existing methods to highlight their contributions and validate the effectiveness of BrainDIVE in activating targeted brain regions. It would also be beneficial to discuss the compute time required for generating a single image and to address the demographic characteristics of the small human subject database used in the study. Finally, we encourage the authors to ensure that the presentation of images does not bias readers and to clarify the validation process for the generated images.
