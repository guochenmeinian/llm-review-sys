Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents two main contributions: VPGen, a stepwise T2I generation framework that first generates object counts, then layouts, and finally images, and VPEval, a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that correlates better with human judgment. The authors demonstrate that VPGen's approach yields images more aligned with input text compared to existing models like stable diffusion, evaluated through the newly proposed VPEval scores.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The VPGen decomposition enhances controllability in image generation, particularly in adhering to object counts and spatial relationships from text prompts.  
- VPEval offers a more comprehensive evaluation metric that aligns closely with human assessments, improving interpretability.  
- The writing is clear, and the experiments are solid, providing a good correlation of VPEval with human judgments.

Weaknesses:  
- The results section lacks standard evaluation metrics such as FID and IS scores, limiting the assessment of image quality and diversity.  
- The first step of VPGen requires exact object counts in prompts, raising questions about its flexibility with more complex or ambiguous inputs.  
- The motivation for using a language model (LM) for layout generation is unclear, and the paper lacks an error analysis of VPGen's failures.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the results section by including standard evaluation benchmarks such as FID and IS scores to assess image quality and diversity. Additionally, we suggest providing a clearer explanation of the design choice for using an LM in VPGen and its benefits over existing methods. More visualizations and examples would enhance the clarity of the framework's capabilities. Lastly, addressing potential failure cases and conducting ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the stepwise generation process would strengthen the paper.
