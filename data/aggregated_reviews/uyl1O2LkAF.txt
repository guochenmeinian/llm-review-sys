### Key Points
This paper presents a novel dataset for table-to-text generation in eight languages, including seven African languages and Russian. The authors detail the dataset collection process and provide both automatic and human evaluations of models fine-tuned on their data. The evaluation reveals that a significant portion of the generated texts lacks clarity and attribution. The authors also introduce new metrics for human evaluation, claiming better correlation with human ratings than existing metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed dataset is a valuable resource for under-documented languages.
- The experiments are thoroughly documented and the evaluation is comprehensive.

Weaknesses:
- The task definition is unclear, and the paper's presentation is somewhat scattered, making it difficult to follow.
- There is insufficient information about the annotators, their agreement, and the rationale behind the evaluation metrics.
- The inclusion of Russian as a zero-shot test language lacks clear justification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the task definition and provide a clearer structure to enhance readability. Specifically, please clarify the nature of the task input and ensure that examples correlate with text-to-text generation models. Additionally, include detailed information about the annotators, including their spoken languages and inter-annotator agreement. We suggest addressing the ambiguity regarding the references used in the evaluation and justifying the choice of Russian as a test language. Finally, consider using a token-free pretrained model, such as byT5, to better accommodate the representation of African languages.
