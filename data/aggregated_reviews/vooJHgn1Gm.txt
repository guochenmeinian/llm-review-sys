### Key Points
This paper presents a new decoding method, fidelity-enriched contrastive search (FECS), aimed at addressing the hallucination problem in existing decoding methods like SimCTG. The authors propose a strategy that selects tokens based on maximum similarity to the source context and minimal similarity to previously generated tokens. The evaluation is conducted on tasks such as abstractive summarization and dialogue response generation, demonstrating that FECS achieves a favorable balance between faithfulness and diversity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-motivated and addresses a significant issue in text generation.  
- The proposed method is straightforward and effectively enhances factuality.  
- The presentation of the paper is clear and the experimental results support the main objectives.

Weaknesses:  
- An incorrect equation is used in Section 2.1 regarding the degeneration penalty term.  
- The selected evaluation metrics are not convincing, lacking comparisons with advanced methods like MAUVE or BertScore.  
- Hyper-parameter search is insufficient, particularly concerning the impact of parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ on the trade-off between faithfulness and diversity.  
- The paper lacks human evaluation and examples of generated text, which would strengthen its claims.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the accuracy of the equation in Section 2.1 to correctly reflect the similarity minimization with **ALL** previous tokens. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons against advanced evaluation metrics such as MAUVE, BertScore, or human evaluation to substantiate the results. It is crucial to conduct a thorough hyper-parameter search to explore the effects of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ on the trade-off with a fixed value of $k$. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide human evaluations and more examples of generated text to enhance the paper's credibility and impact.
