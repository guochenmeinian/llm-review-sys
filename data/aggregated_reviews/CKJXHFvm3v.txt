### Key Points
This paper presents the Graph Diffusion Social Recommender (GDSR), a dual-model approach that integrates a denoising module using dual diffusion models and a recommendation module employing a dual graph neural network structure. The model aims to mitigate noise in user-item interaction and social graphs, enhancing the performance of social recommender systems. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of GDSR through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, showing significant performance improvements over various state-of-the-art baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem statement is well-motivated, and the proposed methods exhibit a degree of novelty.
- The paper is well-organized, with clear figures illustrating model architectures and experimental results.
- The experiments are detailed and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- Many model components have been previously reported, limiting the technical novelty.
- The related work section lacks a comprehensive summary of existing research on social recommendation and denoising.
- The main idea of using diffusion models for recommendation denoising does not present significant novelty, as this paradigm has been established in prior works.
- The formulation of contrastive learning is not intuitive, and the rationale for its application in this context is unclear.
- The comparison with baselines is insufficient, lacking relevant self-supervised social recommendation methods and the latest denoising techniques.
- The analysis of denoising results is inadequate, and some sections, such as Section 4.7, lack meaningful insights.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section by providing a more systematic summary of existing research on social recommendation and denoising. Additionally, the authors should clarify the novelty of their contributions, particularly regarding the use of dual diffusion models. The formulation of contrastive learning should be made more intuitive, and the authors should include comparisons with more relevant baselines, including self-supervised social recommendations. A more detailed analysis of the denoised graphs is necessary to showcase the effectiveness of the denoising process. Finally, we suggest enhancing the clarity of the introduction and the readability of figures to improve overall accessibility.
