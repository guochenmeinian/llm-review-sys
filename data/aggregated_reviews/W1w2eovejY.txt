### Key Points
This paper presents UPET, an uncertainty-aware and parameter-efficient self-training framework that utilizes Monte Carlo dropout for estimating model uncertainty and introduces an uncertainty-aware pseudo-labeling mechanism. The authors propose a method for selecting reliable samples from unlabeled data and an easy-hard contrastive tuning method to enhance performance. Empirical results demonstrate UPET's effectiveness in low-resource scenarios across various language understanding tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant NLP problem regarding the reliance on extensive labeled data in low-resource scenarios.
- UPET innovatively incorporates uncertainty estimation and efficient parameter updating, leading to improved noise handling and computational efficiency.
- Extensive experimental results validate UPET's effectiveness, showcasing superior performance over baseline methods.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks discussion and testing in high-resource scenarios, limiting understanding of UPET's versatility.
- The choice of parameters updated during the training method requires further exploration and analysis.
- Comparisons with other semi-supervised learning methods are insufficient, hindering UPET's positioning within the broader field.
- The methodological innovations may not provide significant new insights for NLP practitioners.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of UPET's performance in high-resource scenarios to provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Additionally, a detailed analysis of the parameters updated during the efficient training method would enhance understanding of their impact on performance. We suggest including comparisons with other semi-supervised learning methods to better position UPET within the field. Finally, expanding the range of tasks or languages tested would further demonstrate UPET's robustness and generalizability.
