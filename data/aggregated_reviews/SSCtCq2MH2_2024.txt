Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel hybrid framework that utilizes 3D Gaussian representations for estimating the geometry and physical properties of deformable objects from multi-view video. The authors propose a dynamic 3D Gaussian reconstruction combined with a coarse-to-fine filling strategy to generate density fields, which facilitate the extraction of object continuums and guide physical property estimation through differentiable material point method (MPM) simulation. The method shows promising results, outperforming previous approaches in dynamic reconstruction and real-world applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The reduced order modeling of 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) is well-suited for reconstruction tasks with limited views.
- The introduction of a motion-factorized dynamic 3D Gaussian network effectively reconstructs object states as a linear combination of basis motions.
- The experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly under large deformations, and the method is applicable in real-world scenarios.

Weaknesses:
- Some symbols and terms are not clearly defined, leading to confusion (e.g., $Discretize$ operator, $\tilde{P}$, and $F$).
- The paper lacks experimental proof for the sufficiency of the lightweight architecture of the motion-factorized network.
- Technical terminology is misused, such as referring to "implicit shape representation" incorrectly.
- The transition from MPM to FEM in real-world experiments requires justification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of definitions for symbols and terms used throughout the paper, particularly for the $Discretize$ operator and variables in Algorithm 1. Additionally, we suggest providing experimental validation for the motion-factorized dynamic 3D Gaussian network's architecture. It would also be beneficial to clarify the terminology used regarding shape representations to enhance readability. Finally, justifying the switch from MPM to FEM in real-world experiments would strengthen the manuscript.
