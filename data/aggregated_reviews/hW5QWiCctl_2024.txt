Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a technique called GraphMorph for extracting tubular patterns in images, such as veins in retinal images and roads in aerial images. The proposed pipeline consists of several modules: a segmentation network for centerline probability and features, a graph decoder for detecting nodes and connectivity, and a morph module for generating centerline masks. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the pipeline against state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks. The authors also address curvilinear image segmentation, moving beyond pixel-level predictions to improve both False Positive and False Negative errors. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and clear.  
- Experimental results against state-of-the-art methods are convincing.  
- The method effectively handles both False Positive and False Negative errors, which is a notable improvement over existing methods.  
- The link prediction idea is technically sound, and the morph module is novel and appears effective.  

Weaknesses:  
- Some hyperparameters, such as thresholds, need to be set, and the methodology for determining these parameters is unclear.  
- The authors should provide standard deviations for performance metrics to assess statistical significance and conduct a t-test for confirmation.  
- The computational complexity of the method should be compared to baselines, particularly regarding training and inference time.  
- Concerns about overfitting on small datasets and the applicability of the method to full 3D CT scans are raised.  
- Claims regarding the clinical impact of the method are considered over-stated, given the limited utility demonstrated in real clinical applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology for setting hyperparameters, particularly regarding whether experiments for setting \( p_{thresh} \) are conducted on test sets. Additionally, please provide standard deviations for performance metrics and conduct a t-test to confirm statistical significance. It would be beneficial to include a discussion on the computational complexity of the method compared to baselines. We also suggest that the authors carefully revise their claims about the clinical impact of their work to align them more closely with the experimental results and consider participating in public challenges to validate their method on more complex datasets.
