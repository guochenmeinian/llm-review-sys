### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of autobidding in online advertising auctions, focusing on the challenges posed by noisy and interdependent bidder signals, which can lead to the "winner's curse." The authors demonstrate the inefficiencies of traditional auction formats, such as the second-price auction (SPA) and first-price auction (FPA), under these conditions. They propose a novel mechanism, the Contextual Second Price Auction (CSPA), which leverages multiple signals to mitigate adverse effects and shows that uniform bidding is an optimal strategy in CSPA. The paper establishes a tight bound on the price of anarchy (PoA) for CSPA of 2, aligning with results from independent settings, and asserts that CSPA achieves at least half the welfare of SPA.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a thorough theoretical analysis with clear definitions, theorems, and proofs that establish the properties of CSPA.
- The introduction effectively motivates the significance of interdependent values and clarifies the paper's contributions to existing literature.
- The theoretical results are solid, non-trivial, and well-structured.

Weaknesses:
- The paper is highly technical, potentially challenging for readers unfamiliar with the autobidding problem.
- The assumption that the contextual mechanism knows all signals of all bidders is overly strong, raising questions about the necessity of holding an auction.
- The paper lacks empirical evaluations or simulations to demonstrate the practical implications of CSPA.
- Several assumptions about bidder behavior and auction environments may not hold in real-world scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the accessibility of the paper by providing clearer explanations for readers less familiar with the autobidding problem. Additionally, we suggest revising the assumption that the mechanism knows all bidders' signals, perhaps by considering a model where the mechanism has access to only the distribution or coarse information about each value signal. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include empirical evaluations or simulations to illustrate the practical implications of CSPA. Lastly, addressing the questions raised regarding the differences between autobidding and traditional auctions, as well as clarifying the modeling choices, would enhance the paper's clarity and robustness.
