Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration-enhanced equivariant graph neural network (E2GN2) aimed at improving sample efficiency and generalization in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). The authors address the "early exploration bias" inherent in standard Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) and propose a solution that involves adding a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to offset biases in the output. The paper claims that E2GN2 significantly outperforms standard GNNs and MLPs by over 10 times in sample efficiency on benchmarks like MPE and SMACv2, while also demonstrating improved handling of complex action spaces. Furthermore, the authors argue that E2GN2 outperforms the E3AC method in terms of win rates and learning efficiency across various benchmarks, particularly in the SMAC environment, emphasizing the computational efficiency of EGNN compared to SEGNN, which is crucial for practical applications in MARL. The authors also plan to enhance the precision of their claims, particularly in the abstract, introduction, and results sections, and clarify that "equivariant networks demonstrate improved sample efficiency over the MLP and GNN in the protoss and terran SMACv2 environments."

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method offers a novel architectural fix for the exploration bias problem, providing valuable insights into the application of EGNNs in MARL.
- The authors provide empirical evidence demonstrating that E2GN2 outperforms E3AC on SMAC benchmarks, achieving higher win rates and faster learning times.
- The paper is well-structured and presents results in an accessible manner, with illustrative examples enhancing readability.
- The authors effectively identify and address the challenge of managing complex action spaces within the MARL framework.
- The commitment to improving clarity and specificity in the claims and descriptions is commendable.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks sufficient experimental baselines and comparisons to prior work, particularly regarding symmetry utilization and entropy-based methods for exploration.
- Clarity issues arise in the mathematical representation and notation, which could hinder understanding.
- The theoretical depth and novelty of the contributions compared to existing literature, particularly regarding the use of SEGNN, are questioned.
- The paper lacks a comprehensive analysis of exploration performance compared to existing entropy-based methods, which is essential for evaluating the proposed approach's efficacy.
- The handling of partial observability and the rationale for using zero-mean Gaussian policies are insufficiently explained, raising concerns about the reproducibility of the results.
- The justification for sticking with EGNN over potentially better architectures is not sufficiently robust, and the novelty of the three-distribution technique is seen as incremental.
- The initial descriptions of the environments and action spaces were not sufficiently precise, which may have led to ambiguity in the paper's claims.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the mathematical model and notation, ensuring all symbols and inputs are well-defined. Additionally, the authors should include more comprehensive experimental baselines, particularly those that utilize symmetry and entropy-based methods, to strengthen their claims. It would be beneficial to clarify the novelty of their approach in relation to existing literature and to provide a detailed discussion on how partial observability is managed in their experiments. We also suggest that the authors enhance the theoretical justification for using EGNN over other architectures, particularly in light of the exploration bias issue. A more thorough comparison with existing entropy-based exploration methods should be included to provide a clearer evaluation of the proposed method's performance. Lastly, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the abstract, introduction, and results sections by making all claims more precise, ensuring that the updated description of SMACv2 effectively conveys its complexities, and replacing vague terms like "complex action space" with more specific phrases such as "mixed discrete-continuous action spaces" and "environments with multi-tiered objectives."
