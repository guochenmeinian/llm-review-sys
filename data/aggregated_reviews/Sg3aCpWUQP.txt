Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework that combines Fréchet regression with principal component regression (PCR) to address high-dimensional, errors-in-variables settings for non-Euclidean response variables. The authors leverage the low-rank structure of the covariate matrix to enhance estimator efficiency and accuracy. Theoretical analyses demonstrate the consistency and convergence properties of the proposed estimator, supported by numerical experiments on synthetic datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a new framework that effectively utilizes the low-rank structure in the covariate matrix.
- The proposed method is straightforward to implement and shows promise in errors-in-variables regression settings.
- Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- The background discussion is imbalanced, focusing heavily on Fréchet regression while providing superficial coverage of errors-in-variables.
- The proposed method does not ensure convergence for errors-in-variables, which is critical for success in this context.
- There is a lack of data-adaptive choice for the tuning parameter $\lambda$, which is crucial for principal component regression implementations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the balance in the background section by providing a more comprehensive discussion of errors-in-variables and how PCR is expected to mitigate these issues. Additionally, the authors should clarify how the proposed method achieves convergence for errors-in-variables. We also suggest investigating a data-adaptive approach for selecting the tuning parameter $\lambda$, as its choice is pivotal for effective implementation. Finally, expanding numerical experiments to include larger sample sizes and real-world datasets would strengthen the paper's contributions.
