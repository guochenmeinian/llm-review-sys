Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper extends the concept of decision sparsity through the introduction of the sparse explanation value (SEV), including cluster-based and tree-based SEV, and proposes algorithms to optimize decision sparsity. SEV is defined as the number of factors that must be altered from reference values to change a decision. The authors build upon the Sparse Explanation Value approach by Sun et al., enhancing it in terms of closeness and credibility.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The problem addressed is significant for real-world applications, such as in medical and criminology fields.  
- The examples provided, particularly in Table 2, effectively illustrate the problem.  
- The approach is mathematically sound and well-articulated, with comprehensive experiments supporting the claims made.  
- The paper is well-written and creatively considers closeness, sparsity, and credibility.

Weaknesses:  
- The method's current version lacks scalability, and its incremental nature limits its applicability.  
- The transition from a single negative reference point to a clustered approach is seen as trivial.  
- Tree-based SEV is constrained to decision tree models, which may restrict its broader use.  
- The paper could benefit from a complexity analysis and a discussion on the time expenditure of different SEV variants.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the scalability of the method to enhance its applicability. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide examples to clarify the statement regarding human intuition in classification. It would also be beneficial to discuss the cost implications of modifying features in the context of recourse more thoroughly. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include a complexity analysis and time expenditure evaluation for the various SEV models, particularly focusing on the computational advantages of tree-based SEV. Lastly, clarifying the meaning of the gray numbers in Table 1 and correcting the duplicate "and"s in line 199 would improve the manuscript's clarity.
