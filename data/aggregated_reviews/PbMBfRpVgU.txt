Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents NUDGE, a framework for interpretable and explainable policy reasoning in reinforcement learning, which the authors claim establishes a fourth type of neuro-symbolic system as proposed by Kautz (2022). NUDGE employs a neurosymbolic method that separates perception and action prediction, utilizing a pre-trained actor-critic model alongside a perception module to evaluate and learn rules for policy generation. The authors argue that NUDGE effectively addresses the drawbacks of Neural Logic Reinforcement Learning (NLRL) by employing differentiable forward reasoning to map neural network outputs to symbolic representations, thus producing human-readable programs. They assert that NUDGE achieves comparable performance to standard RL techniques like PPO while providing interpretable policies and includes comparisons with purely symbolic baselines in their experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and clear, addressing the challenge of uninterpretable reinforcement learning policies.  
- NUDGE introduces neurally guided symbolic abstraction, enhancing model performance by leveraging pre-trained neural policies.  
- The explicit parameter $k$ allows for limiting policy complexity, contributing to interpretability.  
- The authors engage thoroughly with reviewer feedback and demonstrate a commitment to improving the manuscript.  
- The idea of using neural agents to guide logic rule search is innovative and appreciated by reviewers.  
- The paper provides useful insights into exploration issues and the limitations of neural network explanations.

Weaknesses:  
- The experimental setup is inconsistent across different settings, raising questions about methodology.  
- The definitions of interpretability and explainability are vague, lacking engagement with existing literature.  
- The relationship between NUDGE and the PIRL framework is not clearly articulated, leading to potential misunderstandings about its novelty.  
- The claim that NUDGE adapts to environmental changes is misleading, as it relies on changing logic rather than inherent adaptability.  
- The assumption of a pre-trained perception module is not sufficiently emphasized, which could mislead readers regarding the paper's applicability.  
- Reviewers express concerns about the changing experimental settings, suggesting that the method simplifies the problem by using structured inputs instead of unstructured ones.  
- The novelty of NUDGE is questioned, with some reviewers comparing it unfavorably to existing frameworks like PIRL and suggesting that it does not sufficiently differentiate itself from prior work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of definitions for interpretability and explainability, engaging with existing literature to establish clear criteria. We suggest addressing the inconsistencies in the experimental setup and providing a more comprehensive comparison with existing symbolic methods in more complex environments. Additionally, we recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding the nature of the inputs used in their experiments, specifically addressing the distinction between unstructured and structured inputs. We encourage the authors to clarify the differences between the Differentiable Forward Reasoning module and AlphaILP, and to discuss the implications of using predefined meanings for symbols in terms of interpretability. We also suggest that the authors acknowledge the limitations of their approach in relation to existing frameworks like PIRL and provide a more detailed discussion on how NUDGE differs from and builds upon these works. Lastly, we recommend that the authors provide a more thorough examination of the limitations of requiring a pre-trained perception module, as this may impact the generalizability of NUDGE, and ensure that all experimental results are clearly presented and contextualized within the broader landscape of neuro-symbolic methods.
