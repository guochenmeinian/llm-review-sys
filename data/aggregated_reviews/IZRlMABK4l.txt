Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a fast test-time adaptation super-resolution (SR) framework named SRTTA, which addresses the degradation shift issue between training and test images. The authors utilize a pre-trained degradation classifier to predict the degradation type of test images and adapt the SR model through feature-level reconstruction learning from the test image and its second-order degraded counterpart. The framework is evaluated on a newly synthesized DIV2K-C dataset and a real-world DPED dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling various degradation types. Additionally, the authors analyze degradation types in real-world images across five datasets, reporting that blur is the most prevalent degradation type. They also provide visualizations of pretrained model performance across different domains and degradation types, addressing the domain shift problem in image super-resolution.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The SRTTA framework allows rapid adaptation of pre-trained SR models to diverse degradation types, making it applicable in real-world scenarios.  
- The introduction of a second-order degradation scheme and feature-level reconstruction learning enhances the model's practicality for real-time applications.  
- The authors construct the DIV2K-C dataset, which includes eight different degradation types, contributing to the research community.  
- The inclusion of statistical data on degradation types enhances the paper's empirical foundation.  
- Visualizations of pretrained model performance effectively illustrate the impact of domain shifts.

Weaknesses:  
- The framework appears to focus on single degradation types, which may not reflect the complexity of real-world scenarios where multiple degradations coexist.  
- The evaluation on the DIV2K-C dataset lacks comprehensive analysis, limiting the generalizability of the findings.  
- The visualization comparison methods are outdated compared to quantitative methods, and the GPU time reported is not optimal.  
- The notation in the Super-Resolution Test-Time Adaptation section lacks consistency, and the definition of second-order degraded images needs clarification.  
- The paper currently lacks sufficient citations to contextualize the domain shift problem within the broader community.  
- More examples of each degradation type are needed to provide clarity and depth.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the limitations of the framework regarding multiple degradation types and clarify how the proposed method handles such scenarios. A more comprehensive evaluation on diverse real-world datasets should be included to strengthen the claims of generalizability. Additionally, we suggest incorporating modern visualization techniques for comparison and optimizing the reported GPU time. The authors should ensure consistent notation throughout the paper and provide a clearer definition of second-order degraded images. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors include additional citations to relevant literature that discusses the domain shift problem and enhance the visualization section by providing more examples for each of the eight degradation types mentioned. Finally, including examples that illustrate the effects of domain shifts on SR performance would enhance the paper's depth and relevance.
