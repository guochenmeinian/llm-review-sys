Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a time-varying extension of SAFEOPT, termed TVSAFEOPT, designed to address time-varying rewards under time-varying safety constraints. The authors provide optimality guarantees under stationarity conditions and demonstrate favorable numerical simulations compared to SAFEOPT. The algorithm incorporates a spatio-temporal kernel and time Lipschitz constants, ensuring safety even in non-stationary environments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.  
2. It addresses an open problem in the literature regarding time-varying rewards and safety constraints.  
3. Formal safety guarantees for the TVSAFEOPT algorithm are provided.  
4. The use of a spatio-temporal kernel in Bayesian optimization is novel.  
5. A formal proof of safety and optimality guarantees is included.  
6. Extensive numerical simulations validate the proposed approach.  

Weaknesses:  
1. Some delineation to related work is vague and requires stronger justification; a table could help highlight key aspects.  
2. There is a lack of real-world data experiments and comparisons to existing TVSBO approaches.  
3. The empirical results could be more convincing with a variety of initial safe sets and revised plots, as current results are hard to parse.  
4. The theoretical challenge of extending safety to the time-varying case needs more detail.  
5. More discussion on the tradeoff between optimality and safety is encouraged, especially in high-dimensional problems.  
6. The method for choosing the proper initial safe set and kernel parameters is unclear.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the delineation of related work by providing stronger justification and consider including a table to highlight key aspects. Additionally, we suggest incorporating real-world data experiments and comparisons to existing TVSBO approaches to support the downsides of current methods. To enhance the empirical results, we advise adding a variety of initial safe sets and revising plots for clarity. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide a more detailed discussion on the theoretical challenges of extending safety to the time-varying case. Lastly, we recommend discussing how to balance optimality and safety, particularly in high-dimensional scenarios, and clarifying the method for selecting the initial safe set and kernel parameters.
