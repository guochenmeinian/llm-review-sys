Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents active learning strategies for global sensitivity analysis of expensive black-box functions, focusing on learning the importance of input variables. The authors propose novel active learning acquisition functions targeting key quantities of derivative-based global sensitivity measures (DGSMs) under Gaussian process surrogate models. The study demonstrates that these strategies enhance sample efficiency in DGSM estimation, particularly with limited evaluation budgets, through evaluations on synthetic and real-world problems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-structured, with clearly outlined main points.
2. Novel acquisition functions are derived specifically for DGSMs under Gaussian process models.
3. Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in RMSE estimations over baseline methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The most effective performance metric for global sensitivity analysis remains unidentified.
2. The proposed acquisition functions are straightforward applications of existing criteria in the active learning literature.
3. There is a lack of explicit convergence guarantees or theoretical results for the proposed methods.
4. Some categories of acquisition functions are missing, such as those based on information gain for absolute gradients.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the most effective performance metrics for global sensitivity analysis. Additionally, providing explicit convergence guarantees or theoretical results would strengthen the paper. The authors should also consider including a heuristic baseline comparison in their experiments and elaborate on the practical implications of the NDCG results compared to RMSE. Finally, addressing the overhead execution time associated with the sequential design would enhance the paper's utility for practitioners.
