Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a model capable of predicting the emergence of abilities using only the information from the first ability's emergence. The authors propose a multilinear model to analyze the multitask sparse parity problem, which mimics the theorized distribution of language datasets. The model successfully predicts emergent abilities in a 2-layer MLP and demonstrates scaling laws consistent with previous findings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper expands on recent works in a significant and active research area, providing convincing results when evaluating the proposed model against MLP training data.
- It includes extensive derivations in the appendix, and the writing is clear with well-visualized results.
- The theoretical model unites sigmoidal-shaped skill emergence with scaling laws, which is of high interest to the community.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental scope is limited, particularly in Figure 1, which only examines 5 skills. A broader range of skills would enhance the analysis.
- The focus on the multitask sparse parity problem restricts the applicability of the findings to more natural settings.
- The scaling laws presented may mislead readers into thinking they are novel when they replicate those from Michaud et al. A clearer relation to Michaud et al. is necessary.
- The theoretical setup lacks clarity, particularly in how it represents a sum of skills, and it does not adequately connect to real-world phenomena.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental scope by including results for more than 5 skills to better understand the prediction of less-frequent skills. Additionally, we suggest expanding the discussion to include results from more natural settings to enhance the paper's relevance. Clarifying the relationship to Michaud et al. in the main text will help avoid misconceptions regarding the novelty of the scaling laws. Furthermore, we advise revising the title to reflect the specific focus on the multitask sparse parity problem, such as "An exactly solvable model for emergence and scaling laws in the multitask sparse parity problem." Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the theoretical setup to better articulate how it represents a sum of skills.
