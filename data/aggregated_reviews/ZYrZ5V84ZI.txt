Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Voila-A, a cognitively-enhanced Vision-Language Model (VLM) that integrates gaze information to improve user interaction in applications like AR/VR. The authors introduce two datasets, Voila-COCO and Voila-GAZE, and a new model architecture that utilizes gaze data collected via the BubbleView method. The approach is evaluated against baseline models, Otter and Kosmos-2, demonstrating improved performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and clearly outlines the motivation and contributions, addressing an underexplored area in VLMs.
- Introduction of novel datasets (Voila-COCO and Voila-GAZE) and a new open-source VLM model based on OpenFlamingo.
- Detailed descriptions of model architecture and extensive ablation studies enhance the understanding of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for incorporating gaze data lacks clarity, particularly regarding its necessity over textual descriptions.
- The evaluation methods are insufficiently explained, with unclear comparisons to baseline models and missing details on hyperparameter tuning.
- Limited novelty in the model architecture, as it closely resembles the Flamingo model, with the main contribution being the integration of gaze data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for integrating gaze data, specifically addressing why textual descriptions alone are inadequate. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the evaluation section by providing clearer comparisons to baseline models and including human preference evaluations alongside GPT-4 rankings. It would also be beneficial to conduct a user study to validate the effectiveness of the Voila-GAZE dataset and to justify design decisions in the model architecture with ablation studies. Finally, addressing the limited novelty of the architecture by exploring alternative design choices could strengthen the paper's contribution.
