### Key Points
This paper investigates the language model's capability to create interactive world models for common-sense reasoning tasks, such as washing dishes or starting a campfire. The authors assess this ability by generating programs that produce text-based gaming environments aimed at completing specific tasks. These environments include necessary devices and distractors to challenge the language model. The authors employ the GPT-4 model API using a single shot in-context learning (ICL) approach, demonstrating that self-reflection on outputs significantly improves program runability from 28% to 58%. The research contributes a corpus of 32 world models as text-based games, introduces evaluation metrics for game quality, emphasizes self-reflection's importance, and highlights limitations in generating accurate world models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The intuitive idea of projecting commonsense reasoning as formal language generation.
- The novel corpus, BYTESIZED32, offers opportunities for future research.
- Validity of the introduced metrics is supported by expert human annotators.
- Clear presentation of the main hypothesis and findings, addressing implicit questions effectively.

Weaknesses:
- Sole reliance on GPT-4 limits replicability and future research development.
- Evaluation of quality traits using GPT-4 raises concerns about circular evaluation.
- Lack of exploration of open-source models capable of handling long contexts.
- Insufficient error analysis and sensitivity to prompt design in code generation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve replicability by incorporating open-source models capable of handling long contexts, such as Longformer. Additionally, we suggest conducting an analysis of performance differences between similar and dissimilar reference games to clarify the model's reasoning capabilities. An explicit examination of prompt design sensitivity, particularly regarding the inclusion of distractors, would also enhance the study. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide a thorough error analysis of the generated code to identify common issues and their implications for reasoning capabilities.
