### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of children's exposure to ads on YouTube across countries with varying levels of advertising regulation. The authors document significant issues regarding the nature and duration of ads, particularly highlighting the disparity in enforcement of child protection policies. They argue that stronger regulations correlate with more appropriate advertising content, although this assertion is challenged by the potential influence of economic factors and algorithmic targeting.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The topic is critical and underexplored, addressing children's safety in digital advertising.
- The methodology is thorough, with a well-explained coding process and comprehensive data analysis.
- The comparative research design across different regulatory environments is a notable contribution.

Weaknesses:
- The authors' claims regarding the effectiveness of regulation are overly assertive, lacking sufficient causal evidence.
- The writing is at times muddled, making it difficult to extract key findings without additional visual aids.
- The analysis does not adequately address potential confounding variables, such as economic conditions and device sharing patterns.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve their framing of the relationship between regulation and ad appropriateness, emphasizing the need for caution in attributing causality. Consider softening claims about the impact of policy and exploring alternative explanations, such as economic factors and algorithmic influences. Additionally, we suggest enhancing clarity by incorporating more figures and highlighting key statistics in the text. Addressing the limitations of the dataset and discussing the implications of viewing behaviors in different economic contexts would also strengthen the paper. Finally, providing clearer references to tables and ensuring consistency in terminology will improve the overall readability and coherence of the work.
