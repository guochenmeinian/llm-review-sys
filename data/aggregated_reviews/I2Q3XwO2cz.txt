### Key Points
This paper presents the OAM-TCD dataset, a novel open-access resource for individual tree crown delineation from high-resolution aerial imagery. The dataset includes 5,072 images at 10 cm/px resolution from OpenAerialMap, with instance masks for over 280,000 individual trees and 56,000 tree groups. By sampling from diverse geographic locations, OAM-TCD addresses limitations of existing datasets, such as low resolution and lack of global diversity. The authors conduct extensive experiments, demonstrating the dataset's utility through baseline models for semantic and instance segmentation, with strong performance on independent datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- OAM-TCD addresses the deficiencies of existing datasets by providing high-resolution, globally diverse imagery.
- The authors rigorously evaluate baseline models, demonstrating robustness and generalization capabilities.
- The dataset, models, and code are publicly available, promoting transparency and reproducibility.
- The authors invest in annotation, enhancing the dataset's quality for the community.

Weaknesses:
- There may be biases or underrepresentation of certain regions, potentially impacting model performance in those areas.
- The paper lacks a detailed discussion of challenges during the annotation process, including inter-annotator agreement and quality control measures.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors assess how the model performs at different resolutions, particularly whether it can transfer to lower resolutions like 30-50 cm through downsampling during training. Additionally, a more detailed discussion of the annotation process challenges and quality control measures would strengthen the paper. Finally, we suggest clarifying the ethical implications of the dataset's 10 cm resolution and ensuring that the dataset is publicly available upon publication, as indicated.
