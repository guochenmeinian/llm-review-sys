Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CIMSleepNet, a framework designed to tackle the challenges of automated sleep staging in the presence of incomplete multimodal physiological data. The authors propose a Modal Awareness Imagination Module (MAIM) for imputing missing data and a Semantic & Modal Calibration Contrastive Learning (SMCCL) approach to align recovered data with actual distributions. The framework also incorporates a multi-level cross-branch temporal attention mechanism to enhance temporal context modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CIMSleepNet significantly outperforms existing methods under various missing modality scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- CIMSleepNet effectively addresses missing modalities through MAIM and SMCCL, improving performance and reliability in sleep staging.
- The framework is validated across five multimodal sleep datasets, showcasing robustness.
- The multi-level cross-branch temporal attention mechanism captures comprehensive temporal context, enhancing model interpretation of stage transitions.

Weaknesses:
- The architecture's complexity may lead to increased computational overhead, potentially affecting real-time application efficiency.
- The model's reliance on complete multimodal data for training could limit its effectiveness in real-world scenarios with incomplete datasets.
- There is insufficient discussion on existing work related to missing modalities, and comparisons with less computationally intensive methods are lacking.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how comparison methods handle missing data, possibly by employing a two-stage procedure where data is first imputed before applying the framework. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed commentary on the performance differences observed in qualitative results and the appendix comparison table. Expanding the discussion on existing methodologies addressing missing data in multimodal contexts would enhance the paper's context. Finally, addressing the computational efficiency and scalability of CIMSleepNet in practical applications would be beneficial.
