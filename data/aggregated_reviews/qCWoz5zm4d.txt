### Key Points
This paper presents StructureSAT, a large benchmark designed to evaluate the generalization capabilities of GNN-based SAT solvers across various structural properties of SAT instances. The authors propose a method for splitting the dataset into detailed hierarchies based on these properties and conduct comprehensive experiments to assess the performance of different GNN solvers. The results highlight existing challenges and suggest future directions for enhancing generalization performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an important topic at the intersection of SAT solving and machine learning.
- The methodology is sound, incorporating both CNF-based and graph-based structural properties.
- The dataset is well-designed, covering various domains, and the writing is clear and well-structured.

Weaknesses:
- The focus is primarily on empirical performance evaluation, making it difficult to derive unified conclusions about GNN performance across varying structural properties.
- The paper lacks detailed comparisons with state-of-the-art CDCL solvers and could benefit from deeper error analysis.
- Some technical details, particularly regarding structural properties, may be vague for readers less familiar with SAT solving terminology.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis of their findings and provide more extensive experiments, including additional GNN baselines and state-of-the-art GNN variations that exhibit better expressivity or generalization performance. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on the practical implications of their findings for real-world SAT solving applications and clarify technical details to enhance accessibility for a broader audience.
