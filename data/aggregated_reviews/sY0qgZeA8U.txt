Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on fair clustering for data summarization, specifically addressing the Fair-k-Supplier problem through a 3-approximation algorithm. The authors improve upon existing algorithms, particularly for intersectional groups, and provide insights into scalability and fairness trade-offs. However, the reliance on synthetic data and limited real-world datasets raises concerns about the applicability of the findings. The paper also lacks a detailed analysis of the fairness impact and complexity evaluation across various parameters.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed algorithm offers a theoretical guarantee and improves efficiency for intersectional group cases.
- The problem addressed is significant and under-researched, with solid theoretical analyses.
- Comprehensive experiments include both synthetic and real-world data.
- Major limitations are discussed, providing directions for future research.
- The paper is well-written.

Weaknesses:
- The heavy reliance on synthetic data may not accurately reflect real-world complexities, limiting the results' applicability.
- The algorithm's memory requirements and computational costs for large-scale problems are not adequately addressed.
- The clarity of experimental results, particularly in distinguishing between the authors' algorithm and baselines, is insufficient.
- Missing references and a lack of detailed discussions on fairness metrics and the implications of results weaken the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical validation by testing the algorithm on larger-scale real-world datasets or generating semi-synthetic data based on existing small datasets. Additionally, a more detailed quantitative analysis of the algorithm's time and space complexity across different parameter configurations should be included. The authors should clarify the experimental results by clearly distinguishing their algorithm from baseline comparisons and ensuring that the units of measurement are explicitly stated. Finally, a discussion section reflecting on the practical implications of the findings and how they advance the field of fair clustering would enhance the paper's impact.
