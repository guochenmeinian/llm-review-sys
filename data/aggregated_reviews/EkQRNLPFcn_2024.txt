### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative approach to enhancing the safety of large language models (LLMs) through category-specific steering vectors. The authors propose a method that allows for fine-grained control over LLM outputs, significantly advancing current safety steering techniques. By tailoring steering vectors to specific harm categories, the authors enable targeted interventions, reducing the risk of harmful or biased content while preserving the utility and coherence of the model's responses. The paper emphasizes the importance of ongoing evaluation and refinement of steering vectors and introduces a training-free methodology that facilitates integration into existing frameworks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper exhibits high scholarly rigor and clarity, effectively conveying a compelling concept.
- The proposed method is computationally efficient, requiring only a single forward pass at inference time.
- The originality lies in the introduction of category-based steering vectors, addressing a significant gap in LLM safety.

Weaknesses:
- A detailed comparison with existing safety steering methods regarding performance metrics is lacking.
- The methodology for assigning categories to prompts is not clearly defined, leading to challenges in standardization.
- There is a notable trade-off between reducing harmful intent and maintaining output quality, which is not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of specific lines, particularly lines 36-37 and 71-72, and consider removing superfluous content such as line 86. Additionally, a more detailed comparison with existing safety steering methods, including performance metrics, would enhance the paper's contributions. The authors should also develop a standardized mechanism for category definition to address the challenges posed by the broad nature of categories. Finally, addressing the trade-off between harmful intent reduction and output quality in a meaningful way would strengthen the significance of the work.
