Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on alignment methods for large language models (LLMs) to enhance factuality, focusing on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO). The authors propose the Flame framework, which differentiates between fact-based and non-fact-based examples, utilizes few-shot generated examples for fact-based SFT, and constructs a reward model specifically for factuality. Experiments across multiple datasets indicate that Flame improves factuality without compromising other capabilities, such as instruction following. The paper also highlights the limitations of conventional alignment processes and the need for a factuality-aware approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for the study is clear, supported by a pilot experiment demonstrating the limitations of existing methods.
- The framework is straightforward and applicable to various systems, with effective ablation experiments showcasing the contributions of each component.
- The dual-stage factuality-aware method enhances factuality while preserving instruction-following capabilities.

Weaknesses:
- The absence of external baselines limits the comparison of the Flame model with related approaches, such as few-shot prompting and sampling methods.
- The reliance on the model's ability to classify instruction types may hinder the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.
- Key implementation details, such as few-shot prompts and fact decomposition, are omitted, which could benefit future research.
- Evaluation metrics like FactScore have limitations, and the paper lacks human evaluations to strengthen its findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve their comparison by including external baselines, such as few-shot prompting and reranking methods, to provide a clearer understanding of relative performance trends. Conducting human evaluations on a subset of examples would enhance the robustness of the findings. Additionally, we suggest that the authors include more detailed implementation information in the main text rather than solely in the appendix, and consider using a more comprehensive metric like Veriscore for evaluation. Finally, exploring the generalizability of the Flame framework to smaller models and other LLM capabilities, such as reasoning and code generation, would provide valuable insights.
