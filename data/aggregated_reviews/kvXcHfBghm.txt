Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for recalibrating probabilistic classifiers by decomposing Mean Squared Error (MSE) into calibration and sharpness errors. The authors propose a unified framework that addresses both calibration and sharpness, introducing a recalibration risk measure that minimizes both aspects simultaneously. They also develop a uniform mass binning algorithm to approximate the optimal recalibration map and provide theoretical results on the trade-offs between calibration and sharpness, particularly in the context of label shift.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is exceptionally well-written, with a clear structure and logical flow, making it accessible to a broad audience.
2. The theoretical foundation is robust, with detailed proofs that enhance understanding.
3. The proposed algorithm is simple and efficient, facilitating implementation.
4. The paper contributes significantly to the literature by addressing the often-overlooked trade-off between calibration and sharpness in probabilistic classifiers.

Weaknesses:
1. The experimental validation is limited, primarily relying on toy datasets without exploring real-world applications or more complex scenarios.
2. Some assumptions, particularly Assumption 2, are considered strong and may not hold in practical settings.
3. The paper lacks a discussion on how it differentiates from existing recalibration methods and does not adequately address empirical results from prior works.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including tests on real-world datasets, such as CIFAR-10 or CIFAR-100, to demonstrate the effectiveness of their method in complex scenarios. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a clearer discussion in Section 1.1 on how their approach differs from existing recalibration methods. Addressing the limitations of their assumptions and expanding on the implications of their findings in multi-class settings would also enhance the paper's impact.
