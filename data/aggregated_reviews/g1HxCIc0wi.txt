Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new variant of parallelization in the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, termed Speculative MCTS, which predicts the next move before completing the search on the current node. This approach, akin to branch prediction in CPU pipelining, aims to reduce training latency by speculatively executing future moves. The authors experimentally demonstrate a two-fold acceleration in training for the game of Go, leveraging both speculation and a caching technique to enhance performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The writing is clear, with well-articulated motivations and extensive experimental details.
- The proposed method shows significant improvements in training efficiency, achieving a 2x speedup with just one lookahead step.
- Empirical evaluations provide evidence of the method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental evaluation is insufficient, lacking comprehensive analysis and clarity on the selection of base numbers of simulations.
- The ablation section requires significant expansion to address critical questions regarding the method's applicability and performance under varying simulation counts.
- The efficiency analysis does not adequately consider the potential for failure at each step of a move.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental evaluation by providing a more comprehensive analysis of the proposed MCTS parallelization, including a detailed explanation of how the base numbers of simulations were selected. Additionally, we suggest significantly extending the ablation section to address the applicability of the method beyond AlphaZero and the game of Go, as well as the implications of lowering the number of simulations. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to validate the potential benefits of more lookahead steps in real experiments and clarify the differences between inter-decision and intra-decision parallelism. Lastly, we advise including comparisons with existing methods to strengthen the contribution of the paper.
