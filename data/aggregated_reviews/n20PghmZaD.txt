Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents two significant contributions to hallucination mitigation: a paragraph-level dataset for zero-shot hallucination detection and a method named reverse validation (RV) for detecting hallucinations in generated passages. The authors demonstrate that their RV method outperforms existing passage-level methods, particularly those adapted from sentence-level approaches, using the WikiBIo-GPT3 dataset. The paper addresses a critical issue in LLMs, providing a new benchmark (PHD) that focuses on entity-based hallucinations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors will share their code and datasets, enhancing reproducibility.
- The paper is well-written, with a natural dataset construction process that aids in understanding LLM hallucinations.
- The RV method is well-motivated and shows promising results, outperforming baselines by at least 10% in F1 scores.

Weaknesses:
- The exclusive reliance on ChatGPT, a black-box model, raises reproducibility concerns, as its performance can vary over time.
- The paper lacks transparency regarding the data collection procedure, including payment structures and ethical considerations.
- Missing details about the reverse validation method and the data generation process hinder a full understanding of the contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the transparency of their data collection procedure by disclosing payment structures and ethical statements. Additionally, we suggest providing more details on the reverse validation method and the automatic data generation process. To enhance reproducibility, consider using a community model alongside ChatGPT to allow for independent verification of results. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the motivation for distinguishing between passage-level and sentence-level hallucination detection methods. Lastly, addressing the inconsistency between experimental results and analysis would strengthen the paper's claims.
