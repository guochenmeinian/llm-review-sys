Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to identify their own outputs and explores the correlation between self-recognition and self-preference. The authors conduct experiments across two summarization tasks and three LLMs, demonstrating that LLMs exhibit self-preference due to self-recognition. They find that self-preference strength correlates linearly with self-recognition, while addressing potential confounding factors in their analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors present novel results that could significantly influence model training and evaluation.
- The methodology, results, and limitations are clearly articulated, making the paper easy to follow.
- The analysis of potential confounders is compelling and well-executed.

Weaknesses:
- The hypothesis regarding self-preference may be problematic, as it suggests that LLMs prefer outputs because they recognize them, rather than generating outputs due to preference.
- The experimental scope is limited, focusing on only two summarization datasets and three LLMs, raising concerns about generalizability.
- The experiments lack sufficient statistical rigor and diversity, particularly in exploring pairs that do not include self-generated text.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental diversity by including additional tasks beyond summarization to enhance the generalizability of their findings. Conducting experiments with pairs that exclude self-generated texts could provide crucial insights into the nature of LLM preferences. We also suggest incorporating more robust statistical analyses to validate the findings and addressing the potential confounder of memorization in summarization datasets. Additionally, clarifying the explanations of figures, particularly Figure 2, would enhance reader comprehension.
