### Key Points
This paper presents DISENTANGLEDSSL, a self-supervised learning method aimed at achieving controlled disentanglement of multimodal data. It utilizes an information-theoretic framework to distinguish shared and modality-specific information, incorporating a two-step optimization strategy that remains effective even when the Minimum Necessary Information (MNI) point is unattainable. Empirical results indicate that DISENTANGLEDSSL outperforms existing baselines in disentanglement quality and downstream task performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method offers a novel approach to disentangling shared and modality-specific information in multimodal data.
2. The theoretical foundation is robust, leveraging information theory, particularly the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle.
3. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. Limited discussion on scalability and how the model performs with increasing data complexity or dimensionality.
2. The experimental results appear less promising compared to other baselines.
3. Clarity issues arise from disjoint sections in the method, and the definition of "true latent" is unclear.
4. The paper lacks feature distribution visualizations, such as TSNE, which could enhance understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on scalability to address how the model handles increased data complexity. Additionally, clarifying the definition of "true latent" and linking appendices to the main text would enhance clarity. We suggest incorporating feature distribution visualizations, such as TSNE, to provide better insights into the model's performance. Finally, ensuring that important abbreviations are introduced in the main body rather than the abstract would improve readability.
