Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a normalizing flow architecture that is equivariant with respect to the Euclidean group SE(3) and the permutation group S_n, utilizing coupling blocks. The authors propose a method that combines augmented flows to achieve equivariance, similar to previous works by Klein et al. and Huang et al., while ensuring SE(3) symmetry through zero center of mass subspaces. Additionally, the paper introduces a novel reversible flow method for protein-folding problems that preserves geometric and permutation symmetries, marking the first successful application of these constraints to external Cartesian coordinates. The experimental results provide a comprehensive comparison with existing baselines, demonstrating the proposed architecture's advantages over continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) and Klein et al.'s proposal. The architecture shows promise in molecular generation tasks, particularly in approximating the Boltzmann distribution, and is reported to be over 100 times faster for sampling compared to SE(3) CNFs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The manuscript is very clearly written and well-organized, providing clear explanations and supporting mathematical details.
- It includes a thorough and extensive experimental analysis.
- The proposed architecture elegantly combines well-known mechanisms to achieve full equivariance.
- Both likelihood and energy-based training methods are considered.
- The model fills a significant gap in the field by achieving SE(3) equivariance in Cartesian coordinates.
- The proposed flow is reported to be significantly more efficient for sampling.

Weaknesses:
- The manuscript primarily integrates previously proposed ideas, making it somewhat similar to Klein et al.'s work.
- The presentation of the method, particularly from section 3.1 onwards, is somewhat confusing and could benefit from more intuitive descriptions and examples.
- The use of $\gamma_r$ for projection lacks clarity and precision in its mathematical definitions.
- The DW4 and LJ13 datasets are biased, which affects the accuracy of test log likelihood comparisons.
- The E-ACF's scalability is not superior to CNF/ResidualFlows/MintNet for training with samples, limiting its applicability in certain contexts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the proof of equivariance by using more standard notation and providing additional details. Specifically, they should clarify how the group action leads to an equivariant flow. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explore the use of other flow architectures for $\tau_{\theta}$ to enhance expressivity. It would also be beneficial to include experiments that compare the performance of equivariant and non-equivariant models across various dataset sizes to investigate sample efficiency. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the dataset selection by addressing the biases in the DW4 and LJ13 datasets, potentially by creating their own unbiased training and test sets. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore the application of their model to multi-modal or transfer learning scenarios, particularly in modeling energy landscapes of molecules, as this could leverage the symmetries enabled by their approach.
