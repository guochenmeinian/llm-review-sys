Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to learning a manifold over customized diffusion model weights, termed weights2weights (w2w), aimed at facilitating interpretable applications such as sampling, editing, and inversion of identities. The authors utilize a dataset comprising over 60,000 fine-tuned models to construct this manifold using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and principal component analysis (PCA). The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the w2w space in generating, editing, and reconstructing identities, showcasing its potential for broad applications in generative modeling.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The concept of modeling a manifold over customized diffusion model weights is innovative and has significant potential for generative applications.
- The organization and clarity of the paper are commendable, with detailed explanations of methods and theoretical foundations.
- Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed w2w space in various applications.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks comprehensive comparisons with prior literature, leading to inaccurate claims regarding the existence of linear latent spaces in diffusion models.
- There is insufficient discussion on the impact of diffusion time steps on the construction of the w2w space, which could enhance the paper's depth.
- Evaluation metrics used may not fully capture nuanced attributes related to human faces, and the paper does not adequately address the performance implications of LoRA training on the base model.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on existing literature, particularly addressing the claims about linear latent spaces and comparing their work with recent studies. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on the influence of diffusion time steps on the w2w space and consider incorporating user studies for subjective evaluations. Expanding the application scenarios beyond identity context and providing a clearer exploration of the advantages of w2w over existing methods would also strengthen the paper.
