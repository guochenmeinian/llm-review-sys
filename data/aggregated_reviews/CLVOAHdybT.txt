### Key Points
This paper presents a methodology for Distant Supervised Relation Extraction (DSRE) using a Huffman tree-based Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) approach and circular cosine similarity to measure associations between sentences. The authors propose a novel model that demonstrates effectiveness across several benchmark datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed method is novel and shows state-of-the-art results on various datasets.  
- The use of circular cosine similarity and the Huffman tree algorithm is innovative, contributing to effective noise discrimination and information aggregation.

Weaknesses:  
- Important experiments are missing, including comparisons with different sentence encoders and various weight computation methods.  
- The paper lacks a thorough analysis of time complexity and case studies comparing selection quality across methods.  
- The writing is criticized for being poor, and some claims are not sufficiently supported.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including comparisons with different sentence encoders, such as PCNN, and exploring various combinations of weight computation methods and aggregators. Additionally, providing a detailed analysis of time complexity and including case studies to compare selection quality would strengthen the paper. Clarifying the distinction between the proposed method and existing strategies regarding noise determination is also essential. Lastly, addressing the writing quality and ensuring all technical terms are accurately presented will enhance clarity.
