### Key Points
This paper presents a method for Graded Lexical Entailment (GLE) that outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by exclusively utilizing WordNet. The authors model GLE as a trade-off between semantic similarity and specificity loss, both defined using Resnik's Information Content. The evaluation shows a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.75 on the HyperLex dataset, indicating superior performance compared to existing methods. The paper includes ablation studies to analyze the impact of its components.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The method achieves state-of-the-art results on the GLE dataset.  
- The approach is simple and relies solely on WordNet, which is intriguing for the NLP community.  
- The paper is well-written and includes ablation studies for component analysis.  

Weaknesses:  
- Reported results are not fully comparable to those of other systems due to lack of replication with the same data.  
- The necessity of predicting GLE is not clearly justified, and the paper lacks examples of GLE tasks with scores.  
- Some technical aspects, such as the function lcs in Equation 3 and the meaning of "k" in Equation 2, are not adequately explained.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparability of results by replicating experiments with related methods using the same data. Including actual examples of GLE tasks and their scores would enhance understanding. Clarifying the necessity of GLE in relation to previous studies and addressing the potential applications of resulting synset pairs for word sense disambiguation would strengthen the paper. Additionally, we suggest providing clearer definitions for technical terms and ensuring that all equations are well-explained.
