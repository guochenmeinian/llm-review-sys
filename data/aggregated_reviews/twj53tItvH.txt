### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to zero-shot multimodal information extraction (ZS-MIE) through the multimodal graph-based variational mixture of experts (MG-VMoE) network. The authors propose two modules, VMoE and MG-VAT, to address the semantic gap between textual and visual modalities. The experimental validation includes ablation studies and hyperparameter analysis, demonstrating the model's effectiveness. However, the paper lacks a thorough theoretical analysis of the interaction between the modules and does not provide sufficient case studies to illustrate their effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The MG-VMoE method shows promising results in multimodal information extraction tasks, particularly in zero-shot settings.
2. The paper is well-structured, making the information flow logical and easy to follow.
3. Comprehensive experiments and in-depth ablation studies validate the robustness of the findings.

Weaknesses:
1. The manuscript requires improvements in English language usage and clarity, with inconsistencies in grammar and technical terminology.
2. The experimental validation is limited, lacking comparisons with methods specifically designed for zero-shot multimodal information extraction.
3. There is insufficient theoretical analysis regarding how VMoE and MG-VAT interact and enhance model performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and grammar of the manuscript through a thorough review by a native English speaker. Additionally, enhance the visual presentation of figures, particularly Figure 2, for better consistency and clarity. We suggest expanding the experimental validation to include more recent baseline comparisons and additional datasets, as well as conducting statistical significance tests. A more thorough discussion of practical considerations, including computational efficiency and real-world deployment challenges, would also strengthen the paper. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide a detailed theoretical analysis of the interaction between VMoE and MG-VAT, including their synergistic effects and any feedback mechanisms. Lastly, including case studies to demonstrate practical applications and highlighting the motivation of the paper would enhance its applicability and impact.
