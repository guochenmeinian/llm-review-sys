### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for answering time-sensitive questions using LLMs by reformulating the QA task as a programming task. The authors propose parsing questions and external knowledge into code, prompting the LLM to match the parsed question to external evidence for answering. Empirical results on three datasets demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art prompting methods, ReAct and CoT.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors show consistent improvement across three datasets.
- The approach effectively applies LLMs augmented with tools for temporal reasoning.
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with thorough empirical evaluation.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty is limited as the coding ability of LLMs has been previously demonstrated for other reasoning tasks.
- The approach has not been tested on implicit questions in the TempQuestions and TimeQuestions datasets.
- Generalization to other QA tasks with different constraints remains unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding the necessity of reframing the QA task as programming, particularly in addressing the challenges of natural language processing. Additionally, we suggest including experiments with other LLMs, such as text-davinci-003, to assess generalizability. Furthermore, the authors should elaborate on the exclusion of implicit questions in the TempQuestions and TimeQuestions datasets and clarify the implementation of the check function mentioned in the paper.
