Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on aligning vision models with human aesthetic standards in a retrieval system. The authors propose a model that includes LLM rephrasing, re-ranking, and reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning, along with two novel benchmarks to integrate aesthetic quality into evaluation metrics. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses the aesthetic quality issue in image retrieval systems and introduces a reinforcement learning fine-tuning strategy that allows direct retrieval based on semantics and aesthetic quality, eliminating multi-stage filtering.
2. It introduces two evaluation benchmarks that address the limitations of current image retrieval benchmarks regarding aesthetic quality.
3. The experiments are comprehensive, demonstrating the importance of each component in the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
1. The methodological process is cumbersome, with Figure 2 outlining key processes in a rudimentary manner, complicating reader comprehension.
2. The authors conflate "no-reference image quality assessment" with "image aesthetic quality assessment," despite their distinct nature.
3. Some details, such as the differing number of images in Appendix Table 7, are inadequately explained.
4. The manuscript contains typos, including a garbled indicator function symbol in Equation 11.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodological process and provide a more detailed explanation of the differences between "no-reference image quality assessment" and "image aesthetic quality assessment." Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the discrepancies noted in Appendix Table 7 and correct any typographical errors. Furthermore, we encourage the inclusion of a user study to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and to discuss the limitations of the study, particularly regarding human variance in aesthetic perception and the evaluation of results.
