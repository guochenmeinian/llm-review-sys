Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents GraphACL, an asymmetric contrastive learning framework designed for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs, which does not depend on graph augmentations or homophily assumptions. The authors provide a theoretical analysis and empirical validation, demonstrating the effectiveness of their method across various datasets. They argue that GraphACL captures one-hop local neighborhood context and two-hop monophily similarities, achieving competitive performance on homophilic datasets and improved results on heterophilic datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and easy to understand, with a clear motivation for the proposed method.
- The theoretical analysis and extensive empirical results, including comparisons and ablation studies, substantiate the effectiveness of GraphACL.
- The approach is intuitive, and the implementation appears straightforward, with solid justification for its design.

Weaknesses:
- The paper overclaims originality by stating it is the first to design contrastive learning objectives without homophily assumptions, overlooking existing works.
- The explanation of how GraphACL captures both one-hop and two-hop contexts lacks clarity, particularly regarding the challenges involved.
- Some important references are missing, and the paper could benefit from a more comprehensive evaluation across various downstream tasks beyond node classification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their explanations, particularly regarding the challenges of capturing one-hop and two-hop contexts together. Including concrete examples or analogies could enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest that the authors address the missing references and provide a more detailed theoretical analysis to strengthen their arguments. It would also be beneficial to evaluate GraphACL on a wider range of tasks and datasets to demonstrate its general applicability. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the necessity of the loss in Equation 4 and consider the implications of their method being classified as contrastive.
