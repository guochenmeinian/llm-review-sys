### Key Points
This paper presents AndroidControl, a mobile GUI agent dataset comprising 15,283 unique tasks across 833 Android applications, featuring both high-level and low-level human-generated instructions. The authors investigate the impact of data scale on fine-tuning mobile GUI agents using PaLM-2S, demonstrating that fine-tuning outperforms zero-shot and few-shot baselines in-domain, although out-of-domain performance improves at a slower rate. The dataset's diversity includes apps from various categories, enhancing its utility for developing on-device agents.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is the first to explore the effect of data scale on fine-tuning mobile GUI agents, providing valuable insights.
- The dataset includes both high-level and low-level human-generated instructions, contributing to its richness.
- The writing and illustrations are clear, with a well-structured comparison to prior works.
- The experimental design is robust, yielding insightful conclusions.

Weaknesses:
- Despite higher data quality than AITW, the AndroidControl dataset has a smaller quantity of data, with an average task step count of only 4.8, indicating simpler tasks compared to previous datasets.
- The term "Computer Control Agent" is misleading; it should be replaced with "Mobile GUI Agent" or similar terminology.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset by increasing the number of unique demonstrations to enhance task diversity, as the current setup raises concerns about the adequacy of training data. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the terminology used in the paper, specifically replacing "Computer Control Agent" with a more accurate term. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to discuss how fine-tuning performance and inference costs scale with model size and quantization bits, considering the constraints of on-device models. Lastly, we encourage the authors to address the evaluation of screenshot quality and clarify the sudden decrease in average elements per screen observed in the test sub-splits.
