Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of state space models (SSMs) for co-speech gesture generation, addressing computational challenges and jittering issues. The authors propose a two-stage modeling strategy that incorporates discrete motion priors and hybrid fusion modules. The first stage utilizes multiple VQVAEs to learn discrete holistic gesture priors, while the second stage refines latent space representations through local and global scans. Experimental results indicate that MambaTalk outperforms existing models in generating natural and contextually appropriate gestures.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-structured and clearly written.
2. MambaTalk is the first to explore the selective scan mechanism for co-speech gesture synthesis.
3. The methodology is validated through extensive subjective and objective evaluations.

Weaknesses:
1. Limited novelty; the integration of local and global scans lacks originality, and more discussion on comparisons with baseline methods is needed.
2. Evaluation is restricted to the BEATX-standard dataset, raising concerns about generalizability. Additional datasets like BEAT or RAVDESS should be considered for zero-shot quantitative comparisons.
3. The motivation for the work is unclear, particularly regarding the computational complexity claims and the specific challenges addressed by SSMs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their motivation, particularly regarding computational complexity, by specifying whether it pertains to model parameters, training time, or inference time. Additionally, the authors should enhance the introduction to better articulate the technological contributions of their work. We suggest conducting experiments on additional datasets to strengthen the evaluation and provide comparisons that demonstrate the generalizability of their method. Finally, including more visual results and possibly pseudo-code in the supplementary materials would enhance reproducibility and understanding of the proposed approach.
