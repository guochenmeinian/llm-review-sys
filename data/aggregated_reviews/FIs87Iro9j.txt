Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel face recognition framework that addresses feature fusion challenges in long-range, low-resolution scenes. The authors propose a linear time complexity approach compatible with traditional biometric databases, utilizing learnable agents to represent facial attributes and select relevant experts, thereby reducing inference time and parameters. The method is robust for real-time applications and large probe sets, as demonstrated through extensive experiments on the IARPA BRIAR BTS3.1 and DroneSURF datasets, showcasing the superiority of ProxyFusion in unconstrained settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The authors propose an innovative feature aggregation framework that effectively addresses key challenges in face recognition, particularly in low-resolution and long-range scenarios.  
2. ProxyFusion's feature aggregation method exhibits linear runtime relative to the number of features, enhancing real-time processing capabilities for large probe sets.  
3. The application of a mixture of experts facilitates differentiable sampling for optimal feature aggregation, supported by empirical evidence, particularly with the challenging BRIAR dataset.  
4. The paper is well-written, with clear visualizations and detailed insights into various aspects of the method.

Weaknesses:  
1. The optimization process for sparse experts is not adequately detailed, leaving ambiguity in the method section.  
2. Relying solely on feature-set distribution statistics may overlook fine-grained intra-set relationships, potentially limiting the model's effectiveness.  
3. The performance of ProxyFusion is likely contingent on the quality of input data, with poor-quality inputs potentially degrading results.  
4. The paper lacks discussion on the model's robustness to adversarial attacks, an important consideration in biometrics.  
5. The presentation of the method and experimental sections could be improved for clarity, with several unclear texts affecting the overall rating.  
6. The reproducibility of the method is hindered by insufficient details regarding the experimental setup and the absence of functional code.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the optimization process for sparse experts and provide detailed explanations of how to select negative samples for the proxy loss. Additionally, we suggest addressing the ambiguity surrounding the random splits used in the DroneSURF dataset and providing the splits for future comparisons. The authors should also clarify the statistical significance of their results and ensure that the code is fully functional and accessible to enhance reproducibility. Furthermore, we advise combining repetitive sections in the introduction and ensuring that the time complexity is accurately represented as O(N*K). Lastly, the authors should correct minor errors and improve the overall presentation of the method and experimental results.
