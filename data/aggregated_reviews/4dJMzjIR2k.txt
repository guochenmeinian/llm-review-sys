Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new hierarchical structure, Hi-ArG, designed to represent argumentations effectively by retaining semantics at both the intra-argument and inter-argument levels. The authors propose several pre-training tasks to augment a text-graph model with information derived from argumentation graphs. Experiments conducted on Key Point Matching and Claim Extraction with Stance Classification demonstrate that further pre-training and fine-tuning enhance performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of Hi-ArG offers a novel method for representing argumentations, potentially facilitating future research.
- The paper provides a clear explanation of the exploitation methods for Hi-ArG, supported by intensive experiments that validate the proposed approaches.
- The analysis of the GreaseArG model's degradation contributes valuable insights for further research.

Weaknesses:
- The performance improvement from the proposed method is not substantial, and the paper lacks a direct comparison between Hi-ArG and the Argumentation Knowledge Graph (AKG).
- Clarity issues persist, particularly regarding notation in Figure 3, and the visualization of pre-training tasks is insufficient for understanding.
- The necessity of the inter-argument level in Hi-ArG is not convincingly justified, as it is not utilized in pre-training or inference.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by providing explanations for notations in Figure 3 and visualizing the pre-training tasks for better comprehension. Additionally, we suggest including evaluation results on the correctness of machine-generated Hi-ArG and comparing the performance of GreaseArG with its AKG counterpart on the evaluation tasks to substantiate the superiority of Hi-ArG. Lastly, addressing the justification for the inter-argument level's necessity within the scope of the paper would enhance reader understanding.
