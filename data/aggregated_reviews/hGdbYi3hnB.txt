### Key Points
This paper presents a topology-aware differential privacy Graph Neural Network (TDP-GNN) framework that enhances privacy and utility in GNNs through personalized privacy budgets based on node topological importance. The authors propose a node importance metric using adjacency information entropy and a weighted neighborhood aggregation mechanism. Theoretical analysis confirms that TDP-GNN achieves ùúñ-differential privacy, and experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate improved accuracy compared to various GNN architectures.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a novel approach for personalized privacy protection based on node topological characteristics.
2. The weighted neighborhood aggregation mechanism enhances GNN accuracy when trained with noised data.
3. The methodology is clearly structured and well-explained, making it accessible to readers.

Weaknesses:
1. The introduction of the node importance identification method in Section 3.2 lacks clarity and detail.
2. The criteria for determining privacy sensitivity levels in Section 3.3 are not provided.
3. The allocation of privacy budgets may not effectively address the power-law distribution of node influence, potentially reducing GNN utility.
4. The privacy budget used in experiments is not practical for real applications, and the baselines do not sufficiently cover existing literature.
5. The results presentation could be improved for better readability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the node importance identification method in Section 3.2 by providing more detailed descriptions. Additionally, we suggest including criteria for determining privacy sensitivity levels in Section 3.3. The authors should clarify how their privacy budget allocation addresses the issue of excessive privacy for less influential nodes. We also encourage the authors to evaluate their method using a smaller privacy budget interval and to consider additional utility metrics, such as precision and recall, especially for class-imbalanced datasets. Lastly, enhancing the presentation of results for better readability would be beneficial.
