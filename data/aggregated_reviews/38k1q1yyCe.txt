### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive study on idiom translation, focusing on the influence of idiom phrase frequency in training data on model learning. The authors propose a synthetic evaluation to explore how frequency affects translation accuracy and introduce a new dataset for idiom translation across three languages: French, Finnish, and Japanese. The study evaluates two existing methods—upweighting and kNN-MT—on their datasets to enhance idiom translation quality. The experiments yield strong evidence supporting the authors' conclusions, although some concerns regarding the validity of the synthetic experiments and the novelty of the methods are raised.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and provides a thorough analysis of idiom translation challenges.
- It introduces a new dataset that could significantly aid future research in idiomatic translation.
- The proposed methods show promise in improving translation quality for idioms, particularly in French and Finnish.

Weaknesses:
- The synthetic experiments may not generalize well to natural data, as they oversimplify the complexities of idiomatic expressions.
- The novelty of the work is questioned, as the methods applied are not entirely new.
- The dataset's quality control and annotation processes lack clarity, raising concerns about reliability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their synthetic setup and address how the findings can be generalized to real idiomatic translations. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the dataset's quality control by involving external annotators to ensure reliability in idiomaticity assessments. The authors should also consider providing a clearer distinction between word-by-word and literal translations in their analysis. Finally, we encourage the authors to refine the coherence of the paper's narrative to better highlight the main contributions and connections between experiments.
