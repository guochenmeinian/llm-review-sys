Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SIRIUS, a correction mechanism aimed at enhancing the inference efficiency of large language models (LLMs) through contextual sparsity (CS). SIRIUS selectively corrects key tokens using a full model to improve the performance of sparse models, particularly in reasoning tasks. The authors demonstrate that CS dynamically alters sparsity patterns during inference, achieving higher efficiency than static methods while maintaining performance. However, experimental results indicate that while SIRIUS shows significant improvements in performance metrics on benchmarks like GSM8K, it may degrade performance in high-level reasoning tasks. The method involves infrequently invoking the full model to update the KV cache, interleaving decoded tokens, and rolling back unlikely tokens, showing strong correction with minimal cost through empirical experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The correction mechanism that selectively rewrites the Key-Value (KV) cache is novel and technically rigorous.
2. The paper demonstrates improvements in performance metrics on complex reasoning tasks while maintaining efficiency.
3. The authors effectively address reviewer concerns, leading to improved clarity and empirical validation of SIRIUS across various models and tasks.
4. The method shows a strong tradeoff between performance and accuracy, with significant improvements in latency and correctness for both Llama-3-8B and Llama-3-70B models.
5. The authors explore the viability of contextual sparsity techniques on challenging reasoning tasks, providing valuable insights.

Weaknesses:
1. The KV cache rewriting mechanism necessitates a full LLM of the same architecture as the sparse model, which may limit applicability.
2. The criteria for triggering KV cache rewriting are inadequately detailed, raising concerns about practicality and reliability.
3. The hypothesis that correcting a few key tokens can bridge the gap between full and sparse models lacks sufficient validation across diverse tasks and datasets.
4. The writing quality requires improvement, with several missing citations and unclear descriptions of algorithm functions.
5. There remains a concern regarding the timing of the last-minute results, which may limit reviewers' ability to provide thorough feedback.
6. Some original claims lacked clarity, necessitating corrections and additional empirical support.
7. The paper does not compare against baseline approaches like speculative decoding, limiting the evaluation of its efficiency claims.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the criteria for when to trigger KV cache rewriting and provide empirical details on how likelihood thresholds for error correction are tuned. Additionally, the authors should include experiments on larger models, such as Llama-3-70B, to better understand the impact of contextual sparsity across different model sizes. We also suggest enhancing the writing quality by correcting typographical errors and providing clearer descriptions of algorithm functions, particularly in Algorithm 1. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their original claims regarding the degradation of well-trained models under CS and provide earlier results to allow reviewers sufficient time for feedback. Finally, a comparison with baseline methods like speculative decoding would strengthen the paper's claims regarding efficiency.
