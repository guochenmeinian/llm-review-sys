### Key Points
This paper presents Text2Decision, a neural network designed to predict decision variables from think-aloud text. The authors analyze decision-making processes in both humans and GPT-4, revealing interesting differences in their decision variables, such as GPT-4's ability to utilize different personas that influence its decision-making, while humans tend to rely more on heuristics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The observation of differing focuses in decision variables between humans and GPT-4 is intriguing and adds value to the research.

Weaknesses:  
- Clarity could be improved throughout the paper.  
- Some interpretations of results are lacking.  
- The method lacks novelty and exhibits sub-optimal performance, performing worse than a simple baseline on GPT-4 generated think-aloud text.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity in their writing, particularly regarding the simulation of GPT-4 answers to match human trial sample sizes and the computation of variance in Figure 4. Additionally, please clarify what "text embedding" refers to, especially in relation to the training and inference processes of the Text2Decision model. In Section 4.1, explain the higher variance observed for the "probability-weighted decision maker" persona. In Section 4.2, clarify the absence of explicit labels for categorization in the human data and mention what is being clustered.
