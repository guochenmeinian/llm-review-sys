Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on generalization bounds for clustering problems, specifically center-based clustering and subspace clustering. The authors argue that these problems can be reduced to bounding the Gaussian complexity of cost functions across potential solutions. They utilize the union bound on a telescoping sum over increasingly accurate solution sets. The authors employ the terminal embedding for center-based clustering and introduce a new dimensionality reduction method for projective clustering. The work provides the first provable bound for projective clustering and establishes optimality for specific cases.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors deliver the first provable bound for projective clustering, demonstrating that the previous bound by Fefferman, Mitter, and Narayanan (2016) is optimal for squared cost.
- The chaining technique is innovative and applicable to other learning problems.
- The paper is well-written, with a clear proof sketch and high-level ideas presented effectively.
- Experimental results align with theoretical findings.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for projective clustering in the introduction is insufficient; real applications and common choices of $j$ should be discussed.
- Experiments are limited to $j \in \{1,2,5\}$, with only $j=1$ detailed in the main text, lacking discussion on how results vary with increasing $j$.
- Insufficient exploration of related works and their contributions, particularly in comparison to existing literature on random projection clustering.
- The presentation of references is inconsistent, and the organization of the paper could be improved.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by better motivating the problem of projective clustering, including real-world applications and common choices of $j$. Additionally, the authors should discuss how experimental results conform to or deviate from theoretical expectations as $j$ increases. We suggest a more thorough comparison with related works through experiments to validate the contributions of this paper. Finally, we advise standardizing the presentation of references and enhancing the overall organization of the paper.
