Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents P-Flow, a novel zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) model that combines a speech-prompted text encoder and a flow-matching generative decoder. P-Flow generates speaker-conditional text representations using speech prompts and achieves high speaker similarity performance with significantly less training data and over 20 times faster sampling speed compared to large-scale models like VALL-E. The results indicate that P-Flow offers improved pronunciation and is preferred for its naturalness and speaker similarity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The speech-prompted approach for speaker adaptation is innovative and surpasses traditional speaker embedding methods.
2. P-Flow demonstrates comparable performance to large-scale autoregressive models while utilizing significantly less training data and a smaller transformer-based encoder.
3. The flow matching generative decoder achieves faster sampling speeds without compromising audio quality.

Weaknesses:
1. The audio samples exhibit unstable timbre issues, raising concerns about the model's generalization capacity and subjective evaluation.
2. The novelty of the architecture is limited, as it closely resembles recent non-autoregressive TTS models like Glow-TTS and Grad-TTS.
3. The motivation for using the flow-matching decoder over other generative models is unclear, and the evaluation of zero-shot performance in real scenarios lacks sufficient verification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the unstable timbre issues observed in the demo audio samples and provide further analysis on how this may relate to the limited training data. Additionally, conducting experiments on out-of-domain datasets, such as VCTK, would help validate the generalization capacity of P-Flow. We suggest including subjective evaluations for the "Prompting vs. Separate Speaker Encoder" experiment to strengthen the claims regarding speaker similarity. Furthermore, a direct comparison with Glow-TTS and Grad-TTS in high-quality TTS synthesis should be included to clarify the model's novelty. Lastly, addressing the clarity of certain technical aspects, such as the calculation of \hat_{h} and the performance of the duration predictor, would enhance the paper's comprehensibility.
