Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new probability theory called indeterminate probability theory and introduces the Indeterminate Probability Neural Network (IPNN). The proposed theory extends classical probability theory, making some intractable problems tractable with analytical solutions. The IPNN model is designed for unsupervised clustering and large-scale classification using small neural networks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well organized, with a clear demonstration of the intuition behind indeterminate probability through simple examples. The theory is well formulated, and assumptions are clearly numbered.
2. The indeterminate probability theory appears to be a novel contribution.

Weaknesses:
1. The claim regarding the CIPNN as a contribution is misleading, as it is primarily derived from the authors' previous work. This should either be removed or properly contextualized.
2. Numerous grammatical errors are present, such as incorrect article usage.
3. The properties of probability in IPNN are not adequately addressed, particularly in relation to classical probability theory.
4. The authors' claim about classical probability's binary nature contradicts their definition of conditional probabilities.
5. The use of binary encoding for classification lacks detailed discussion, especially in comparison to one-hot encoding.
6. The distinction between tractable and analytical solutions is misrepresented, as these concepts are not synonymous.
7. The contribution of the paper is primarily the IPNN model, which does not sufficiently extend classical probability theory.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding the necessity of the new probability theory and its distinctiveness from classical theory. The authors should either remove the CIPNN contribution or clarify its relevance. Additionally, we suggest addressing grammatical errors throughout the paper. The authors should provide a thorough examination of the properties of probability in IPNN and clarify the implications of their claims regarding classical probability. A more detailed discussion on output encodings, particularly the advantages of binary encoding over one-hot encoding, is essential. Furthermore, the authors should accurately differentiate between tractable and analytical solutions. Lastly, enhancing the related work section and providing a clearer explanation of the model's limitations would strengthen the paper.
