Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework called "Buffer of Thoughts" (BoT) aimed at enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). The framework utilizes a "meta-buffer" to store high-level problem-solving templates, which are dynamically retrieved and instantiated for new queries. The authors demonstrate that BoT significantly outperforms existing methods, such as tree-of-thought and graph-of-thought, across various reasoning tasks, achieving notable improvements in accuracy and efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The framework is clearly explained, and the writing is easy to follow.
- Empirical evaluations show significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.
- The idea of a library of thought templates is innovative and may enhance LLM reasoning capabilities.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity on the embedding model used for the thought buffer.
- Insufficient information is provided regarding computational resources, particularly for local Mixtral execution.
- The scalability of the approach with varying numbers of thought templates is unclear, as is its effectiveness for queries that do not match any existing templates.
- The quality of automatically generated templates compared to manually prepared ones remains unverified.
- The potential for overfitting to specific reasoning patterns from the templates is a concern.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the embedding model used for the thought buffer and provide more detailed information on computational resources. Additionally, the authors should include examples of tasks in the appendix to enhance understanding without needing to reference external sources. We suggest that the authors address the scalability of their approach and clarify how it adapts to unseen tasks. Lastly, we encourage the authors to refine the language for precision and to correct any typographical errors and inconsistencies in references.
