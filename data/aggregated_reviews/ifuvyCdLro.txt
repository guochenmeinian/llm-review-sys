### Key Points
This paper presents methods to enhance the readability of medical text simplification through unlikelihood loss during training and reranked beam search during decoding. The authors propose a readability index and factuality evaluation to improve the generation of simplified medical text. The evaluation on three datasets shows that their approaches outperform the previous state-of-the-art method in readability metrics, although issues with hallucinations and factual consistency remain.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed unlikelihood loss based on the readability index is original and intuitive.
- The methods show significant improvements in readability over a fine-tuned BART-XSum model, with human evaluations supporting their effectiveness.
- The paper is well-written and presents straightforward methods that can be useful for non-experts.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed approaches lack significant innovation and do not adequately address the unique challenges of medical text simplification.
- The evaluation process has limitations, including low inter-annotator agreement and potential biases, raising concerns about the reliability of the results.
- The experimental results do not consistently support the effectiveness of the proposed methods, particularly in factual consistency and readability on certain datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the applicability of their methods to medical text simplification, addressing the unique challenges in this domain. Additionally, we suggest providing a comprehensive analysis of the evaluation methodology to enhance the reliability and generalizability of the results. Clarifying the feasibility of applying the Flesch-Kincaid readability score at the token level and addressing the limitations of using this metric for partial sentences would strengthen the paper. Finally, including a figure to illustrate the proposed methods could enhance clarity.
