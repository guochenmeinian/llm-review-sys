Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework that employs static analysis to enhance the decoding process of language models (LMs) for code generation, specifically focusing on type-consistency in Java and Rust code. The authors propose a monitor-guided decoding (MGD) approach that constrains the output of LMs by utilizing type-guided method invocations derived from static analysis tools. MGD is positioned as a novel approach within constrained decoding techniques, effectively handling complex coding scenarios, including SQL queries with nested expressions and variable aliasing, without requiring specialized architectures or additional training. The experimental results indicate that this method significantly improves identifier generation and compilation rates compared to baseline models, demonstrating its effectiveness across various model scales.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors propose a static analysis-driven LLM decoding approach that effectively improves identifier generation in scenarios lacking relevant code context.
- MGD utilizes static analyses to handle complex coding scenarios, such as SQL nested queries and variable aliasing.
- The method preserves context for other necessary information while enhancing identifier generation.
- The creation of the PRAGMATICCODE dataset and DOTPROMPTS testset is commendable.
- Extensive experimentation demonstrates the method's effectiveness across various model scales.
- The writing is clear, and the experimental results are convincing.

Weaknesses:
- The MGD approach's applicability is limited to specific cases where static analysis provides additional information, raising concerns about its effectiveness in broader contexts.
- The evaluation is primarily focused on identifier completion, lacking general test sets that reflect real-world usage.
- The experimental design and dataset construction appear tailored to type-consistent identifiers, limiting the generalizability of the findings.
- The handling of arbitrary nesting requires a stack-based monitor, which is still under development.
- There is insufficient discussion regarding the time and memory overhead associated with MGD, which could impact its practicality in real-time applications.
- The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison of MGD's innovativeness relative to past methods that utilized external structural information.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by demonstrating the MGD approach on additional tasks beyond identifier completion, such as bug repair or generating longer-form code. A discussion on the potential for MGD to adapt to other programming languages and coding scenarios would also strengthen the paper. Additionally, we suggest including a detailed analysis of the time and memory overhead of static analysis during decoding, as well as clarifying the stopping criteria and sampling budget in the main paper. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the explanation of how MGD addresses the handling of arbitrary nesting by providing more details on the stack-based monitor's implementation. Lastly, elaborating on the innovativeness of the MGD method compared to previous approaches, particularly in the context of constrained decoding techniques and the use of rich static analyses, could enhance the robustness of the proposed framework.
