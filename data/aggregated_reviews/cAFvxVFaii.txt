Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension to multivariate forecasting models that incorporates error auto-correlation. The authors illustrate the issue of remaining auto-correlation residuals and introduce a method that models cross-covariance through a learned weighted sum of kernel matrices. This approach builds on previous low-rank parameterization work and remains tractable despite its complexity. Experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate improvements in forecasting metrics such as CRPS-SUM, RMSE, and energy scores.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, effectively explaining a technically complex approach.
- It is well-motivated, with insightful data analysis illustrating the presence of autocorrelated residuals.
- The experiments cover a large set of datasets and metrics, with qualitative assessments enhancing the evaluation.

Weaknesses:
- There are potential gaps in experiments, particularly regarding matching budget, as the method is significantly slower than the baseline.
- Details on hyperparameter optimization are insufficient, although the authors plan to address this in the camera-ready version.
- The paper lacks clarity on the competitiveness of the method with better likelihoods, as it currently only studies Gaussian noise, which may inflate residuals.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding the competitiveness of their method with alternative likelihoods, such as paranormal or Student-t distributions, to address potential confounding factors. Additionally, the authors should provide more detailed explanations of their hyperparameter optimization process, specifying which model is used to determine and fix hyperparameters. It is also crucial to clearly state the limitations regarding the method's computational expense, as it is approximately 10x slower than the baseline. Furthermore, we suggest citing relevant literature on multivariate evaluation metrics, such as the paper discussing limitations of CRPS-sum. Lastly, including a table of projection parameters and releasing the code would enhance reproducibility and impact.
