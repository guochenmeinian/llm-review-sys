### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method called MA4DIV, which employs multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to enhance search result diversification (SRD). The authors argue that existing SRD methods are limited in effectiveness and efficiency. MA4DIV models each document as an independent agent in a cooperative setting, optimizing diversity metrics like Î±-NDCG directly. The paper is well-structured, providing a clear description of the framework and its rationale, including the use of a multi-head self-attention (MHSA) module and value decomposition for global diversity optimization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The application of MARL for SRD is novel and shows state-of-the-art performance on various datasets.
2. MA4DIV achieves significant efficiency gains in training and inference, converging faster than baselines.
3. The framework directly optimizes diversity metrics during training, avoiding suboptimal approximations.
4. The use of MHSA ensures permutation invariance in ranking results.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks discussion on scalability issues with large document sets, which could limit MA4DIV's applicability.
2. There is insufficient detail on hyperparameter tuning, which may affect reproducibility.
3. Several relevant recent studies are omitted, weakening the claims made in the paper.
4. The cooperative dynamics among agents are not thoroughly analyzed, potentially missing insights into inter-agent behavior optimization.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on scalability, specifically addressing how training time and computational resources scale with the number of documents. Additionally, the authors should consider including recent related works in their discussion to strengthen their claims. We suggest using a larger sampling size to better simulate real-life systems and to clarify the limitations that prevented this. Furthermore, providing more details on hyperparameter configurations and the modeling of agent cooperation would enhance reproducibility and understanding of the framework. Lastly, addressing practical deployment challenges in real-world search engines would provide valuable insights for potential applications.
