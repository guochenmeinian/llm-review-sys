Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Hyper-HMM, an HMM-based model designed to characterize variability in temporal and spatial dimensions in fMRI sequence datasets. The model utilizes a chain-structured HMM where each discrete state defines a relationship between neural activity and stimulus embeddings, allowing for individual-specific lower-dimensional projection matrices. The authors validate their model through simulations and empirical fMRI data from subjects listening to computer science lectures, demonstrating meaningful clusterings of neural activity and stimulus alignment. Additionally, the authors describe a method that optimizes the overall log-likelihood \( p(X | W, G) \), focusing on the likelihood of data given transform and event pattern parameters. They detail a standard Baum-Welch procedure involving an Expectation step for estimating latent state assignments and a Maximization step for recalculating parameters based on these estimates, with initial event patterns set to the mean of the projected data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed methods are original and significant for analyzing fMRI datasets during sequential tasks across subjects.
- The inclusion of stimulus embeddings enhances the interpretability of learned latent state clusterings.
- The empirical results linking semantic content to fMRI recordings are significant for scientific analysis.
- The additional analyses significantly strengthen the paper, addressing previous concerns and enhancing its contribution to the field of neuroscience.
- The new simulation results effectively resolve earlier issues raised by reviewers.

Weaknesses:
- Clarity regarding the methods and experiments could be improved, particularly in how stimulus embeddings are learned and incorporated into the model.
- Some modeling aspects appear inconsistent, such as the definition of events in voxel space versus lower-dimensional projection space.
- The model fitting approach lacks justification and may not correspond to a single objective like maximum likelihood estimation.
- Some reviewers express dissatisfaction with the responses to their concerns, indicating that further revisions are necessary before publication.
- The description of the algorithm was initially misleading regarding the initialization of transform matrices.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by providing more details on how the stimulus embeddings are learned and incorporated into the model. Additionally, we suggest addressing inconsistencies in the modeling approach, particularly regarding the definition of events and the fitting method. More justification for the fitting approach and simulated data analysis would enhance the paper's rigor. We also encourage the authors to benchmark their method against state-of-the-art techniques and include conventional machine learning metrics in their empirical studies. Furthermore, we recommend improving the clarity of the description of Algorithm 1, specifically stating that the fitting process begins with Î· set to the model priors rather than with G and the Ws. Finally, including a brief sentence about the SNR breakpoint for the method in the limitations section would caution colleagues who may apply this method. Expanding the sample size and simulation parameters to reflect realistic fMRI data characteristics would also strengthen the findings.
