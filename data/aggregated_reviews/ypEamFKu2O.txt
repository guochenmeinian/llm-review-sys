Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Parallel Gated Network (PGN) as an alternative to RNNs, incorporating a Historical Information Extraction (HIE) layer to capture information from previous time steps. The authors propose a Temporal PGN (TPGN) framework with dual branches to model both long-term periodic and short-term semantic patterns, achieving state-of-the-art performance in long-range time series forecasting.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper compares various cutting-edge methods and conducts thorough experiments.  
2. PGN effectively addresses the inherent issues of RNNs, showcasing a novel design that holds potential for replacing traditional RNNs.  
3. The presentation is clear, with well-structured figures and tables that facilitate understanding.  

Weaknesses:  
1. There is a significant lack of analysis and comparison with relevant literature, particularly with SegRNN, which addresses RNN shortcomings in long-term forecasting.  
2. The distinction between Linear-based and MLP-based methods in Section 2 is insufficiently addressed.  
3. The description of HIE is unclear, with inconsistencies between Figure 2 and Equation 1, and the characterization of HIE as a linear layer is debatable.  
4. An ablation analysis of the normalization layer is missing, which is crucial for understanding its impact on TPGN's performance.  
5. The provided source code lacks hyperparameter settings necessary for reproducing key results, raising questions about the defaults used.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis and comparison with SegRNN to clarify the differences and advantages of their method. Additionally, please distinguish between Linear-based and MLP-based methods in Section 2, ensuring accurate classification of methods like DLinear and FITS. We suggest clarifying the HIE description by aligning Figure 2 with Equation 1 and reconsidering the characterization of HIE. An ablation analysis of the normalization layer should be included to explain its contribution to TPGN's results. Finally, please provide a complete runnable script with hyperparameter settings to facilitate reproducibility of the results.
