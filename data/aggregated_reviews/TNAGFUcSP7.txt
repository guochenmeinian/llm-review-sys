### Key Points
This paper presents a unified view of existing sampling algorithms for constrained spaces by leveraging "mirrored optimisation" from convex optimisation. The authors convert the sampling problem into an optimisation problem using Wasserstein Gradient Flows (WGF) and introduce *Mirrored* Wasserstein Gradient Flows (MWGF) to generalise these methods to constrained spaces. They also propose a family of particle-based, learning rate free sampling methods by integrating MWGF with "coin sampling." Empirical results demonstrate that these methods perform comparably to traditional methods with finely tuned learning rates.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The framework of "Mirrored Wasserstein Gradient Flows" generalises existing mirrored sampling methods and introduces new mirrored versions of unconstrained methods.  
2. The combination of MWGF and "coin sampling" leads to learning rate free particle-based sampling methods, which is a significant practical improvement.  
3. The paper is well-structured and presents compelling empirical results that highlight the advantages of the proposed methods over existing ones.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The novelty of the work may be questioned, as it builds on existing mirrored sampling approaches and coin sampling.  
2. There is a lack of clarity regarding the utility of the mirror map in the MWGF introduction, and the authors do not discuss the potential for improved convergence rates.  
3. The empirical results are based on a fixed number of particles, raising questions about the generalizability of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the necessity of the mirror map in the MWGF framework and provide a brief explanation of why this approach is preferable to other bijective transformations. Additionally, we suggest including results for varying numbers of particles in the empirical experiments to assess the robustness of the findings. Finally, addressing the computational complexity of the proposed methods would enhance the comparison with existing approaches.
