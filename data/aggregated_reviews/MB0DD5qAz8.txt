Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an online classification problem that bridges transductive and standard online classification, controlled by a predictor that forecasts examples to be labeled. The authors propose an online learner that outperforms standard algorithms when the predictor is accurate. They establish that transductive online learning implies online learning for predictable input streams and provide a nearly tight lower bound for their results. The paper also explores the complexity of online classification with a predictor, demonstrating a relationship between offline learnability and realizable online learnability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a novel problem in online learning with nearly tight guarantees.
2. The presentation is clear, allowing for quick comprehension of the main ideas.
3. The theoretical results are solid, linking offline and online learnability effectively.

Weaknesses:
1. Most proofs rely on known techniques, limiting originality.
2. The accuracy of the predictor $\mathcal{P}$ is a concern, especially in adversarial settings.
3. The paper lacks discussion on how predictions are generated and does not include empirical evaluations of the proposed algorithms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing, particularly in lines 155-156 and line 56, which are unclear.
2. We suggest rephrasing the confusing sentence in line 145: "to ability to define."
3. We encourage the authors to include discussions on generating predictions from machine learning models and to conduct experiments, even on synthetic data, to demonstrate the proposed algorithm's performance.
4. We recommend addressing the notation confusion regarding the predictor, specifically the definitions of $\mathcal{P}\left(x_{1: t}\right)$ and $\hat{x}_{1: T}$.
