Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Metis, a framework that integrates regular expressions (REs) and neural networks (NNs) for enhanced network intrusion detection. Metis converts REs into a lightweight model through a series of transformations: Rule2DFA, DFA2BRNN, and BRNN2PSRF, employing byte-level tokenization to derive REs from network rules and process network traffic bit streams. The authors claim that Metis can be deployed on network devices without accuracy loss and achieves superior throughput and accuracy compared to traditional REs and baseline models, including BOLT, FA-RNN, and Mousika. Experimental results indicate that Metis reduces TCAM requirements by 97.8% compared to BOLT and consistently achieves higher throughput across various payload lengths. The authors also address the need for additional metrics like F1-Score due to class imbalance in the dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a novel method, Metis, which offers an insightful perspective on using model inference as an alternative to RE matching in network scenarios.
2. Metis effectively leverages the flexibility of deep neural networks while retaining the accuracy of RE-based systems, employing a semi-supervised distillation algorithm for lightweight deployment.
3. The proposed algorithm's effectiveness is validated through real-world datasets and comprehensive experiments, demonstrating superior accuracy and efficiency compared to BOLT, particularly in few-shot and full training scenarios.
4. The reduction in TCAM requirements is substantial, allowing for more efficient resource usage on network devices.
5. The paper acknowledges the importance of reporting metrics beyond accuracy, such as precision and recall, and is well-written, facilitating understanding, and includes code for reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
1. The discussion of differences in related works is insufficiently comprehensive, particularly regarding recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches published in 2022/2023.
2. The evaluation of Metis is limited, lacking comparisons with other SOTA approaches in network intrusion detection, which raises concerns about its relevance.
3. Some experimental details, such as the computational capabilities of the network devices used, are insufficiently described.
4. There is a lack of ablation experiments on critical modules and performance improvement analysis.
5. The impact of removing or replacing any of the three proposed modules on the algorithm is not addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors enhance the discussion of related works to provide a more comprehensive context, particularly by including comparisons with recent SOTA methods in network intrusion detection and knowledge distillation published in 2022/2023. Additionally, we suggest conducting ablation experiments on critical modules to analyze performance improvements and clarifying the computational capabilities of the network devices used in their experiments. Including standard deviation in the results and addressing the potential adaptations of Metis for other applications in cyber-physical system security would enhance the paper's depth. Lastly, we encourage the authors to present the cost of running the proposed approach on devices in terms of latency and other relevant metrics, as well as exploring the implications of removing or substituting any of the proposed modules on the algorithm's overall performance.
