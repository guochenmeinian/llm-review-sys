### Key Points
This paper presents a novel semi-supervised approach for multivariate time series anomaly detection, termed MtsCID, which integrates a dual-network framework to capture both intra-variate and inter-variate relationships through attention mechanisms and convolutional operations. The method also employs frequency domain processing to enhance anomaly detection capabilities. The authors provide extensive experimental results demonstrating that MtsCID outperforms several baseline methods across multiple datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The research addresses a significant problem in multivariate time series anomaly detection, with broad applications.
2. The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, supported by extensive experiments across various datasets.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation for combining various modules lacks clarity, giving the impression of arbitrary integration rather than a targeted solution to a specific problem.
2. The rationale behind the use of stable memory items is questionable, as they are manually set rather than derived from historical data.
3. The paper does not adequately discuss the computational complexity of the model, particularly as dataset sizes increase, nor does it address the representativeness of the datasets used for evaluation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the main motivation for their framework, ensuring that the integration of modules is justified by a clear problem statement. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the stable memory items and their relevance to the dataset patterns. It would be beneficial to include a discussion on the computational complexity of MtsCID, particularly how it scales with larger datasets. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors elaborate on the representativeness of the datasets, addressing potential class imbalances and the impact of different temporal characteristics on model performance. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the connections between the motivations for their architecture and provide more detailed examples of the "silent" features they reference.
