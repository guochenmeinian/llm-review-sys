### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of semantic matching, visual search, and gaze association, focusing on how high-level semantic associations between visual embeddings influence target search in natural scenes. The authors analyze human eye movements during visual search and establish a relationship between text and visual targets, identifying optimal weights that balance semantic and saliency contributions to eye movements. However, doubts arise regarding the selection of semantically relevant features by neural semantic matching, leading to uncertainty about the practical implications of their findings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper provides a thorough examination of the interplay between semantic and saliency contributions in visual search, demonstrating how both factors influence human fixations.  
- The experimental setup is well-structured, and the results are discussed comprehensively.  
- The integration of task orthogonal saliency predictions with semantic matching is a notable highlight.

Weaknesses:  
- The algorithm is not clearly described, leaving reviewers unsatisfied with the clarity of the outcomes.  
- The choice of saliency measure and the negative signing of the match between query and image embeddings require further clarification.  
- The findings may lack robustness due to the small sample size, and the fixation order in figures is not clearly presented.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the algorithm description and provide a more intuitive assessment of the problem, particularly regarding gaze and the application of their findings. Additionally, please clarify the rationale behind the saliency measure used in Eq. (2) and the implications of the negative signing of the match. It would be beneficial to simplify the language around saliency definitions and provide more context for the evaluation measures in the appendix. Finally, please include details on cross-validation splits, standard deviations for measures, and the fixation order in the figures to enhance the overall readability and robustness of the study.
