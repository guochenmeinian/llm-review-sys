Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework called Factor Relaxation with Latent Coupling (FRLC) for low-rank optimal transport (OT), leveraging a latent coupling (LC) factorization and coordinate mirror descent. The authors propose a new parameterization of the low-rank OT problem, which decouples the optimization into three sub-problems, enhancing flexibility and interpretability. The FRLC algorithm accommodates various OT objectives and marginal constraints, with theoretical results supporting its effectiveness. Empirical tests demonstrate its superior performance in applications such as graph clustering and spatial transcriptomics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The contributions are significant, particularly the introduction of the LC factorization and its integration into the FRLC algorithm, which reduces complexity in optimal transport problems.  
- The method is versatile, handling multiple OT objectives and marginal constraints, making it applicable to a wide range of practical problems.  
- The writing is clear, and the experimental results convincingly illustrate improvements over previous LOT methods.  
- The appendix provides a comprehensive review of necessary technical background, and limitations are clearly stated.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks a discussion on scenarios where the optimal transport map is not low-rank, which could lead to slow convergence to full-rank plans.  
- The contributions should be more clearly distinguished from previous works, particularly regarding the new aspects of the approach compared to existing literature.  
- Empirical comparisons with additional baseline methods are limited, and the theoretical results do not guarantee convergence to optimal solutions.  
- The presentation could benefit from a summary table highlighting differences in factorization types and algorithms used.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the implications of non-low-rank transport maps and how LOT may converge slowly in such cases. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the distinctions between their contributions and previous works, particularly in sections 3.1 and 3.2. Including the computational complexity of each step in Algorithm 1 would enhance clarity. We also encourage the authors to conduct more extensive empirical comparisons with additional baseline methods to solidify their claims of superiority. Finally, placing the summary table of differences in the main text would help contextualize their work for the broader community.
