Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the convergence rate of the least squares estimator for learning mixture of experts (MoE) with sigmoid gating, concluding that sigmoid gating is more sample efficient than softmax gating. The authors derive convergence rates under two regimes: Regime 1 (all over-specified parameters are zero) and Regime 2 (at least one over-specified parameter is non-zero). The analysis indicates that sigmoid gating requires fewer samples to achieve the same estimation error compared to softmax gating.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides rigorous proofs and establishes convergence rates under different conditions.
- Sigmoid gating has been less explored in the MoE field, making the analysis of its behavior for expert estimation particularly interesting.
- Empirical studies suggest that sigmoid gating achieves superior performance, supporting the theoretical claims.

Weaknesses:
- The results depend heavily on specific assumptions, such as the distinctness of expert parameters and boundedness of the input space, which may not hold in practical scenarios.
- The comparison between sigmoid and softmax gating does not occur under the same data generation conditions, raising concerns about the validity of the claim regarding sample efficiency.
- The paper's structure is confusing, with excessive repetition and a lack of concise overview, making it difficult to follow.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and organization of the paper by reducing repetition and providing a more concise overview of the problem and main contributions. Additionally, we suggest incorporating empirical results to further support the claim that sigmoid gating is more sample efficient, as current assertions lack empirical evidence. It would also be beneficial to connect the theoretical insights with recent findings in the literature regarding expert training practices, particularly concerning the implications of the assumptions made in the analysis.
