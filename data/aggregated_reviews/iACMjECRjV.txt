Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ConceptFactory, a framework aimed at enhancing the efficiency of annotating 3D object knowledge by utilizing generalized concepts. It comprises two main components: ConceptFactory Suite, which provides a toolbox and web-based platform for object conceptualization, and ConceptFactory Asset, a substantial dataset of conceptualized objects. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various vision and robotics tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- ConceptFactory significantly reduces the time and effort required for annotating complex 3D objects.
- The method is grounded in human cognition theories, enhancing its relevance to object perception.
- The framework has been successfully applied to a variety of object categories, and the large dataset is a valuable resource for researchers.

Weaknesses:
- The performance of ConceptFactory could be evaluated on more complex or novel objects.
- Predefined templates may limit the method's generalizability.
- More user studies are needed to assess user interaction with the system, and the advantages of this annotation approach compared to others remain unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the advantages of their annotation approach by providing more detailed comparisons with other methods. Additionally, conducting user studies to capture end-user experiences with the tool would be beneficial. It would also be helpful to elaborate on the process of selecting categories and objects for the dataset, as well as addressing the limitations of the current templates and knowledge settings.
