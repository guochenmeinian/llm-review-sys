### Key Points
This paper presents the task of narrative event-location trajectory extraction, utilizing Holocaust survivor testimonies as a dataset. The authors propose various methods, including CRF variants and hierarchical transformers, to predict segment locations based on narrative context. Experimental results indicate that these approaches outperform baseline methods that lack sequence information. The paper emphasizes the ethical significance of the dataset and the potential for broader applications in NLP.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The task is novel and socially impactful, with a well-suited dataset.
- The exploration of different architectures provides valuable insights into event-location tracking.
- The introduction of location embeddings enhances the representation of geographical information.

Weaknesses:
- The CRF models underperform compared to hierarchical transformers, suggesting an overemphasis on sequential dependencies.
- The dataset's filtering process lacks transparency, complicating reproducibility.
- The paper does not adequately analyze failure cases for the best-performing model.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the transparency of the data filtering process to enhance reproducibility. Additionally, the focus on CRF models should be downplayed in light of the superior performance of transformers. We suggest incorporating segmentation metrics to evaluate movement between locations more effectively. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of model failures and the implications of using category names instead of exact location names should be included. Lastly, providing more information on hyperparameter tuning and model specifications would support reproducibility.
