Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method called Bi-directional Preference Optimization (BiPO) aimed at steering large language models (LLMs) through optimized steering vectors. The authors propose an optimization objective that enhances the likelihood of generating target behaviors while minimizing opposing responses. Empirical results demonstrate that this method outperforms existing steering techniques and fine-tuning methods across various models. The paper also discusses the transferability and synergy of the steering vectors, showcasing their effectiveness in managing truthfulness and mitigating jailbreaking attacks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The study addresses a significant problem in LLM steering, presenting a novel and concise steering objective inspired by preference optimization techniques.
2. Comprehensive empirical evaluations highlight the proposed method's superiority over state-of-the-art approaches, supported by detailed ablation studies.
3. The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the methodology and experimental results.

Weaknesses:
1. The layer selection process appears tedious and computationally expensive, potentially complicating practical implementation.
2. The introduction contains a confusing analogy regarding the model "speaking up," which may hinder initial understanding of the method.
3. The paper lacks rigorous theoretical analysis of the BiPO approach's advantages over baselines, and it does not adequately discuss computational requirements compared to existing methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction by revising the analogy regarding the model "speaking up" to enhance comprehension. Additionally, we suggest providing a more formal theoretical analysis of the BiPO method to strengthen the paper's contributions. It would also be beneficial to include a detailed discussion of the computational costs associated with BiPO compared to baseline methods, as well as insights into the performance of steering different layers and the potential for steering multiple layers simultaneously. Lastly, consider addressing the scalability of the method for larger models and datasets in more depth.
