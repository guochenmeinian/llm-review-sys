### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of the Leapfrog Triejoin (LTJ) algorithm to efficiently process queries involving topological relationships in knowledge graphs, such as containment and disjointness. The authors demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and space efficiency through detailed experimental results, showcasing superior performance compared to existing methods like SPARQL engines. The paper provides clear definitions and modeling of topological relationships, enhancing reader comprehension of complex queries.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Proposes an efficient query processing method for topological relationships, extending the LTJ algorithm with notable performance gains.
2. Offers comprehensive experimental results that highlight improvements in time and space complexity.
3. Clearly defines and models topological relationships, aiding in the understanding of complex queries.
4. Introduces a novel worst-case-optimal algorithm for evaluating basic graph patterns with topological relations, achieving both space and time efficiency.
5. Provides clear explanations of core concepts and data structures used in the model.

Weaknesses:
1. The experiments primarily focus on small-scale graph query patterns, which may not adequately represent the complexities of large-scale datasets.
2. The comparative analysis is limited to specific benchmarks, lacking discussion on other modern query optimization methods.
3. Certain technical details, such as the index structure and parameter tuning, require further elaboration.
4. The assumption in Section 3.2 regarding the containment relation forming a mono-hierarchy is crucial but not adequately discussed.
5. The paper lacks a detailed discussion on user interaction with topological constraint queries.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental design to include larger-scale datasets that better reflect real-world complexities. Additionally, expanding the comparative analysis to include a wider range of modern query optimization methods would enhance the paper's depth. We suggest that the authors clarify the assumptions made about the dataset and the implications of the mono-hierarchy assumption early in the text. Furthermore, providing more information on the usage of SPARQL and how users define and utilize topological constraint queries could significantly enhance the paper's engineering value.
