### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for subjective bias neutralization in text without relying on parallel text corpora. The authors propose FairBalance, which utilizes a cycle-consistent adversarial network to neutralize bias while preserving bias-independent content. The model incorporates auxiliary guidance to highlight bias-inducing words, yielding strong results in bias neutralization quality. The paper emphasizes the importance of addressing bias in widely used resources like Wikipedia and scholarly articles.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- FairBalance effectively operates without parallel data, a significant advantage given the scarcity of such resources.
- The model design maintains bias-independent content, crucial for preserving the original meaning of the text.
- The incorporation of an auxiliary guidance mechanism enhances training consistency and reliability.
- The methodology is novel and demonstrates improved performance over prior methods.

Weaknesses:
- The baseline models used for comparison, such as MaskedGAN and CycleGAN, are outdated, raising concerns about the fairness of the evaluation.
- The performance of FairBalance is contingent on the accuracy of the bias tagger, which could affect overall results.
- The experiments are limited to specific datasets and domains, leaving uncertainty about the model's generalizability.
- The paper lacks a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed approach.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison of FairBalance with more recent state-of-the-art models for subjective bias neutralization to provide a clearer understanding of its effectiveness. Additionally, the authors should include citations for the baseline models in the main section where they are described. To enhance reproducibility, we suggest providing more detailed parameter settings and ensuring that all data and code are accessible. Lastly, we urge the authors to include an ethics statement addressing the implications of bias neutralization in their work.
