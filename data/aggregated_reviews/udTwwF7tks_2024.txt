Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents EINSMATCH, an early interaction graph neural network for subgraph matching and retrieval, which maintains and refines explicit alignments between query and corpus graphs. The authors propose several novelties, including computing embeddings guided by injective alignments, lazy updates of alignments over multiple rounds, and utilizing node-pair partner interactions. The model effectively learns to identify graph alignments using only pairwise preferences during training. Empirical results demonstrate that EINSMATCH significantly outperforms existing methods across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The analysis comparing GMNâ€™s performance to IsoNet is intriguing.
- Extensive experimental results are provided, including ample baselines and standard errors.
- Source code and data splits are released for reproducibility.
- A significant amount of ablation and parameter sensitivity studies are conducted.
- The writing is clear, and the methodology is solid with informative illustrations.

Weaknesses:
- The datasets used are relatively small, with a maximum of ~20 nodes.
- The background on the graph matching problem and optimal transport is insufficiently explained, requiring external resources for comprehension.
- The complexity of the proposed method is high, and an ablation study on hyperparameter sensitivity would clarify its success.
- The paper lacks a clear discussion on the transferability of the learned model across datasets.
- The presentation could be improved for clarity regarding specific contributions and technical aspects.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the graph matching problem and optimal transport to enhance reader understanding. Additionally, conducting experiments on larger datasets would provide insights into the model's applicability. We suggest including a detailed ablation study or hyperparameter sensitivity analysis to clarify the method's complexity. Furthermore, enhancing the clarity of the presentation, particularly regarding the specific contributions and technical details, would significantly improve the manuscript. Lastly, addressing the questions raised about lazy updates and computational complexity comparisons with IsoNet would strengthen the paper.
