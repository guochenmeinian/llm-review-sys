Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a methodology for auditing differential privacy (DP) mechanisms using canary-based techniques, specifically through the introduction of Lifted DP. The authors propose an improvement in sample complexity by utilizing multiple, randomized canaries, which allows for a more efficient convergence rate in confidence intervals. The methodology is evaluated on various models, including Gaussian mechanisms and DP-SGD trained classifiers on FMNIST and Purchase-100 datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and addresses a significant problem in privacy auditing, providing necessary formalism and empirical support.
- The introduction of multiple, randomized canaries is innovative and fills a gap in the literature by accounting for correlations between hypotheses.
- The theoretical foundations are solid, with detailed proofs and a comprehensive analysis of confidence intervals.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation is limited to simple models, raising concerns about the scalability of the method to larger and more complex datasets.
- The comparison with existing methods, particularly the one referenced (https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08846), lacks clarity regarding the advantages of the proposed approach.
- The dependency of the method's performance on the epsilon level and the implications of noise addition are not sufficiently discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including more complex datasets and architectures to better assess the scalability of their method. Additionally, we encourage the authors to clarify the advantages of their approach over existing methods, particularly in terms of efficiency and applicability. A more detailed discussion on the dependency of the method's performance on the epsilon level and the effects of noise addition would enhance the understanding of the method's robustness. Finally, elaborating on the concept of "poisoning" canaries and the methodology for non-image modalities would provide further clarity.
