Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Advection Augmented Convolutional Neural Networks (ADRNet), which integrates a semi-Lagrangian push operator into CNNs to enhance spatio-temporal sequence prediction. By mimicking the Reaction-Advection-Diffusion equation, ADRNet aims to improve long-range information propagation and explainability. Evaluations on datasets such as CloudCast, SWE, Moving MNIST, and KITTI demonstrate ADRNet's superior performance compared to baseline models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- **Originality**: The innovative use of a semi-Lagrangian push operator for long-range information in CNNs.
- **Significance**: Addresses a critical limitation in CNNs for spatio-temporal prediction tasks, with potential applications in weather prediction and traffic flow analysis.
- **Interpretative Range**: The proposed Advection-Diffusion-Reaction approach significantly enhances the interpretative range of information in CNNs.

Weaknesses:
- **Readability**: The introduction relies heavily on formulas, lacking necessary explanations, which hampers understanding. Writing errors further complicate comprehension.
- **Scalability**: The scalability to larger, real-world datasets and more complex models is not adequately explored.
- **Replication of Results**: The absence of running code makes reproducing experimental results challenging.
- **Experimental Validation**: The experimental section is brief, lacking clarity on evaluations and comparisons with other algorithms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the readability of the paper by providing clearer explanations alongside the formulas and correcting writing errors. Additionally, the authors should explore methods to enhance the generative capabilities of ADRNet and test it on larger, more complex datasets, discussing the results and challenges encountered. It would be beneficial to include visualizations, such as attention maps, to validate the proposed concepts and improve the clarity of figures. Furthermore, the authors should elaborate on the experimental section to clarify the evaluations conducted and consider including a code repository to facilitate replication of results.
