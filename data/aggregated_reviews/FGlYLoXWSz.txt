Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a user study investigating the prevalence of browser fingerprinting in real-world browsing sessions compared to data from automated crawls. The study reveals that automated crawls significantly underestimate fingerprinting practices due to their inability to replicate human interactions. The authors introduce the concept of “Miss Percentage” to quantify undetected fingerprinting across website categories and explore federated learning for privacy-preserving detection. The findings indicate that nearly 47.8% of fingerprinting websites identified by real users are missed by automated crawls, highlighting the limitations of the latter.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study addresses a critical gap in fingerprinting research by demonstrating the inadequacies of automated crawls.
- It introduces novel insights, including the identification of new fingerprinting vectors and the effectiveness of federated learning for training detection models.
- The paper is well-structured, clear, and provides comprehensive background information, making it accessible to readers.

Weaknesses:
- The scope of website coverage is limited, with only 3000 top-ranked websites analyzed, which may not represent the broader web.
- The participant pool is relatively small, potentially affecting the generalizability of the findings.
- There are implementation bugs in the Chrome extension used for data collection, which could impact the reliability of the results.
- The paper lacks detailed evaluation metrics beyond AUPRC, and the discussion on the discrepancies between real-user data and automated crawls is insufficiently clear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the automated crawl by providing a detailed explanation of the crawler script, including its features and limitations, and ensure it visits the same URLs as real users for a fair comparison. Additionally, the authors should address the limitations of scale and generalizability by including multiple browsers in their study. We suggest re-evaluating the data collection methodology to explore alternative approaches that protect user privacy without restricting natural browsing behavior, such as anonymizing collected data. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the relationship between the number of fingerprinting websites missed by automated crawls and those identified from user browsing, and to present additional evaluation metrics to support their claims regarding model performance.
