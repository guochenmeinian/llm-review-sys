Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents OFCOURSE, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) benchmark designed to address the complexities of the order fulfillment process in e-commerce. The authors propose that OFCOURSE is significant as it models the complete order fulfillment process, incorporates heterogeneous agents, and is grounded in practical applications. Unlike previous studies that approached the problem using single-agent reinforcement learning, the authors propose a centralized multi-agent framework that incorporates the interdependencies of various tasks such as order handling, packing, storage, and last-mile delivery. The manuscript discusses the performance of various algorithms, highlighting the advantages of using a Markov game model over traditional Markov decision processes. Additionally, the authors connect their work to mean-field game theory and emphasize the importance of incorporating government regulations into simulations for enhanced realism. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the multi-agent approach over traditional methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- OFCOURSE serves as a pioneering framework for studying significant order fulfillment challenges, benefiting both researchers and industry practitioners.
- The framework's centralized approach and incorporation of MARL algorithms allow for a comprehensive analysis of the order fulfillment process.
- The incorporation of diverse agent types allows for the exploration of complex coordination challenges.
- The authors provide a thorough comparative analysis of various algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach.
- The paper effectively frames the order fulfillment problem as a DecPOMDP environment and offers a modular design for customization.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks detailed comparisons with existing MARL benchmarks, which could enhance its significance.
- The relationship between the order fulfillment problem and reinforcement learning concepts, such as reward functions and state transitions, is not sufficiently clear.
- There are concerns regarding scalability when increasing the number of agents, which may complicate the learning process.
- The focus on price and time may limit the applicability of OFCOURSE in specialized cargo transportation scenarios.
- The experimental section lacks clarity regarding the reward function and the scale of returns, which could confuse readers.
- Potential scalability issues arise when modeling individual orders as agents, which may complicate the learning process.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the significance of OFCOURSE as a benchmark by elaborating on its advantages over existing MARL benchmarks. Additionally, providing a clearer comparison of reward functions, states, and action spaces with existing benchmarks would enhance understanding. Addressing the scalability issue by discussing the implications of increasing agent numbers and their effects on the observation and action space is crucial. More detailed descriptions of the experiments, particularly regarding the reward function and return values, would also be beneficial. Finally, incorporating specific government regulations into the simulation environment could enhance its realism and applicability, as well as including experiments that assess performance as the number of orders increases and comparing the efficiency of the proposed algorithms with existing research would provide valuable insights.
