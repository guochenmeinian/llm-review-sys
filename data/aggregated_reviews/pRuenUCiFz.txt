### Key Points
This paper presents an experimental study on the impact of the Great Firewall of China (GFW) on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), involving four nodes: two server nodes located in Germany and the US, and two NATed clients in the US and China. The findings indicate that the GFW impedes gateway availability in IPFS, likely due to collateral damage rather than a direct effort to hinder IPFS. The study also reveals that NAT location significantly affects content provision, with the NATed machine in China showing similar challenges to that in the US. The authors propose that the connectivity of IPFS is not severely impacted by the GFW.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The experimental setup is well-structured, involving a thoughtful combination of roles (producer/consumer, client/server).
- The paper is informative and presents a relevant topic for the workshop, likely to stimulate engaging discussions.

Weaknesses:
- The ethical implications of conducting research involving a Chinese machine are not adequately addressed, raising concerns about potential reprisals.
- The discussion of findings lacks depth, particularly regarding the implications of low gateway availability and the sustainability of the P2P network with limited gateways.
- The clarity of certain technical aspects, such as the content generation and consumption schedule, is insufficiently detailed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the ethical considerations of their research, particularly regarding potential reprisals against collaborators in China. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on the implications of their findings, especially concerning the low number of operational gateways and the minimum requirements for network sustainability. Clarifying the technical details surrounding the content generation and consumption schedule would enhance the paper's rigor. Furthermore, we suggest converting Figures 2 and 3 to vector-based images for better quality and addressing the discrepancies noted in the connectivity between servers. Lastly, please ensure that the tools and scripts are made publicly accessible with a clear URL for reproducibility.
