Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel neural heuristic approach, NHDE, for Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization (MOCO) problems. The authors propose enhancements to solution diversity through a multiple Pareto optima (MPO) strategy and an indicator-enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method. Experimental results indicate that NHDE outperforms existing neural baselines, achieving superior performance and increased diversity of Pareto solutions across classic MOCO problems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a novel algorithm that effectively generates diverse solutions for combinatorial optimization problems.
2. The method enhances existing approaches, improving diversity metrics such as hypervolumes.
3. The originality of using a hypervolume-based reward and incorporating the current Pareto front into the state input is noteworthy.

Weaknesses:
1. The solving time of NHDE is relatively slow compared to other RL-based CO solvers, and the reported running time of LKH in experiments is unexpectedly high.
2. The authors do not clarify the scope of CO problems that the proposed diversity enhancement can address.
3. There is a lack of concrete evidence supporting claims of reduced duplicate solutions, and the paper does not provide guidance on hyperparameter selection or sensitivity analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the runtime performance of NHDE, particularly in comparison to PMOCO and MDRL, and clarify the reasons behind the slow performance of LKH. Additionally, the authors should provide evidence for the claim regarding the reduction of duplicate solutions and include a sensitivity analysis for the hyperparameters $N$, $K$, and $J$. It would also be beneficial to report the variance of results to assess statistical significance and address the concerns regarding the design of the heterogeneous graph attention mechanism. Finally, we suggest that the authors explore the potential for batch inference in NHDE and clarify the role of preferences in the state representation.
