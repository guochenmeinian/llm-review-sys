Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, termed CoVer, which expands the input representation by utilizing multiple types of corruptions. The authors identify the limitation of previous methods that rely on single-input paradigms, which restrict their ability to extract valid information. By leveraging the phenomenon of confidence mutation, where OOD samples exhibit a significant drop in confidence under corruptions, CoVer averages confidence scores from both original and corrupted inputs, leading to improved OOD detection performance. The authors clarify the necessity of scaling the SVHN dataset from **32 × 32 to 224 × 224** for consistency with ImageNet benchmarks. They emphasize that their method expands input through corruption rather than introducing "extra data," which is typically defined as data from disjoint label spaces. While acknowledging the computational costs associated with their approach, they assert that the innovation lies in the effective use of corruptions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The motivation for using common corrupted images to expand the input space is both novel and reasonable, effectively addressing the challenges of previous methods.  
2. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements across different methods, validating the compatibility of CoVer with various OOD detection techniques.  
3. The theoretical foundation of confidence mutation and the proposed scoring function is robust, with clear and accessible analysis.  
4. The paper is technically solid and presents a novel perspective on OOD detection.  
5. The authors provide clear guidelines for selecting appropriate corruption types and severity levels, enhancing the practical applicability of their method.  
6. The integration of existing OOD scoring functions is well-articulated, demonstrating the validity of their approach.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The advantages of using corruptions compared to existing methods like watermarking are not deeply analyzed, leading to a lack of clarity regarding the benefits of the proposed approach.  
2. The flexibility of CoVer in enhancing different methods is not clearly articulated, and the types of inputs that can effectively improve performance are insufficiently analyzed.  
3. The potential increase in computational costs due to multiple inputs may be a concern for practical implementation.  
4. Lack of clear guidelines on selecting corruption types could lead to variability in results, which the authors acknowledge.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the advantages of using corrupted images for OOD detection compared to watermarking, providing a clearer justification for their approach. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify how CoVer enhances various OOD methods, detailing the differences in effectiveness when combined with techniques such as fine-tuning and zero-shot methods. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to improve the clarity of guidelines on selecting appropriate corruption types and severity levels by merging all results into the manuscript with detailed discussions. We also suggest that the authors highlight the limitations associated with excessive damage to semantic features in their revised version and clearly note the advantages of VLMs/CLIP for OOD detection in the revision.
