Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for generating descriptive captions for images called SMILE, which stands for "Semipermeable Maximum Likelihood Estimation." SMILE aims to enhance the richness of image descriptions while maintaining accuracy, addressing the limitations of traditional models that often produce generic captions. The authors propose a fine-tuning approach using the BLIP model, incorporating techniques such as First Token MLE and First Token Shifting to mitigate exposure bias. The evaluation metrics include CLIP score, lexical diversity, and human assessments on a small sample. Results indicate that SMILE generates more descriptive captions compared to baseline models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles a significant problem in image captioning and presents promising results.
- The writing is clear, and prior work is well-cited.
- SMILE is architecture-agnostic, allowing it to be applied to various captioning models.

Weaknesses:
- Most evaluation metrics are automatic, and the human evaluation set is limited to 50 examples, raising concerns about the robustness of the findings.
- The definitions of conciseness and richness at the methodological level appear rudimentary.
- There is a notable decline in semantic correctness as indicated by the CLIPScore and accuracy metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the human evaluation by increasing the sample size to provide more conclusive results. Additionally, consider incorporating RefCLIPScore as an alternative to CLIPScore, and explore using an object detector to assess the accuracy of identified objects in the captions. Clarifying the definitions of conciseness and richness in a more rigorous manner, rather than through examples, would enhance the methodological clarity. Finally, testing the SMILE approach on a broader range of models would strengthen the claims regarding its robustness and effectiveness.
