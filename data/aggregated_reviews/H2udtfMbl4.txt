### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach, Continuous Normalizing Flows on a Grassmann Manifold (GrCNF), aimed at generating shapes by sampling from probability distributions on Grassmann manifolds. The authors establish theoretical foundations for learning distributions using GrCNF, demonstrating its capability to generate stable shapes and effectively learn distributions on subspace data. The method utilizes a vector field constructed through a neural network and applies a probabilistic density defined as a matrix-variate Gaussian distribution on the Grassmann manifold. Experiments across various datasets, including synthetic and molecular point clouds, validate the effectiveness of GrCNF.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper innovatively extends normalizing flows to the Grassmann manifold, addressing shape generation in low-dimensional manifolds.
- The theoretical framework is sound, and the writing quality is high, making complex concepts accessible.
- Experimental results indicate superior performance of GrCNF compared to existing methods, particularly in generating subspace data.

Weaknesses:
- The applicability of GrCNF to high-dimensional data remains uncertain, which could undermine its theoretical and practical significance.
- The paper lacks a comparative analysis with existing methods, particularly with reference [51], which could clarify its contributions.
- The connection between the Stiefel manifold and the Grassmann manifold is not sufficiently illustrated, leading to confusion regarding the method's implementation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the connection between the Stiefel manifold and the Grassmann manifold, possibly by updating Figure 2 or providing a detailed explanation. Additionally, conducting experiments on real-world high-dimensional data, such as point clouds, would enhance the credibility of the proposed method. We also suggest including a comparative analysis with existing methods, particularly [51], to better demonstrate the advancements of GrCNF. Finally, addressing the computational efficiency of the ODE solver and clarifying the differences between GrCNF and traditional flows under vector fields would strengthen the paper's contributions.
