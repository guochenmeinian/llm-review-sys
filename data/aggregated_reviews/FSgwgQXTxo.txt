Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to enhance autonomous driving through Behavioral Topology (BeTop), a framework derived from braid theory that models multi-agent interactions. BeTopNet, the corresponding network, integrates prediction and planning, guiding trajectory generation based on consensual behavioral patterns among agents. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets, including nuPlan and WOMD, demonstrate BeTop's effectiveness in both prediction and planning tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
* The paper is well-written and organized, clearly presenting its motivation, methodology, and results.
* The innovative use of braid theory provides a solid mathematical foundation for modeling multi-agent interactions.
* The proposed method effectively integrates prediction and planning in a unified framework.
* Comprehensive evaluations on large-scale datasets showcase BeTop's superior performance in both tasks.
* Detailed metrics support the claims of improved performance.

Weaknesses:
* The method currently infers a single type of agent behavior topology from one mode of future trajectories, which may not adequately represent the multi-modal and dynamic nature of real-world interactions.
* There is insufficient discussion on the generalizability of the method to diverse driving environments and the potential computational overhead of the topological framework.
* The paper lacks a detailed comparison with existing methods, such as Wayformer, and does not adequately address the implications of using one-step topology for long-horizon planning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on modeling multi-step and dynamic topologies to enhance the robustness of predictions and planning. Additionally, providing a clearer explanation of how BeTop integrates with various multi-agent settings and detailing the initialization and definition of $Q_R$ and $Q_A$ would strengthen the paper. A thorough comparison with prior work using braid topology would also clarify the advantages of the proposed method.
