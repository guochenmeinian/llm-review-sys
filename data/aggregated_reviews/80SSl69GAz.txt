Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SwitchHead, a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture for the attention layer in Transformers. Unlike the existing Mixture of Attention Heads (MoA) approach, SwitchHead independently applies expert mixtures to the heads' key, value, and output projections, achieving comparable or superior performance with reduced computational power. The design minimizes matrix multiplications and memory costs by requiring fewer instantiated heads, allowing for significant wall-clock speed improvements without compromising language modeling performance. The authors validate their claims through extensive experiments across multiple datasets and model sizes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and organized, presenting a straightforward yet effective method for integrating MoE layers into self-attention blocks.
- The proposed method demonstrates substantial improvements in computational efficiency, validated by comprehensive experiments.
- The authors provide a fair comparison between baselines and the proposed model in parameter-matched settings, including both MAC and wall-clock speedup comparisons.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a clear explanation for the choice of a non-competitive activation function (sigmoid) over SoftMax, which is crucial for understanding the method's design.
- The evaluation is limited to language modeling datasets, with no demonstration of effectiveness on other NLP tasks such as document summarization or open-domain question answering.
- Some notations and terms are used without adequate explanations, leading to potential confusion.
- The paper does not quantitatively analyze the similarity of attention maps between SwitchHead and dense baselines, which weakens claims regarding their comparability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the explanation regarding the choice of the sigmoid activation function over SoftMax. Additionally, it would be beneficial to evaluate SwitchHead on a broader range of NLP tasks to demonstrate its versatility. We suggest providing clearer definitions for terms like "Shared selection" in Table 4 and including training time data for the MoA model in comparisons. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to conduct a quantitative analysis of attention maps to support claims of similarity with dense baselines and to clarify the necessity of hyperparameter tuning for the Top-K selection. Lastly, addressing the potential information bottleneck in encoder-based models would strengthen the theoretical foundation of the proposed method.
