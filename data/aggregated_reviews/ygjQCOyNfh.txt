Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Conformalized Graph Neural Networks (CF-GNN), which extends conformal prediction (CP) to graph-structured data for uncertainty quantification. The authors propose a technique that is permutation equivariant and topology aware, allowing GNNs to produce confidence intervals based on a calibration set. The framework provides theoretical guarantees for coverage and introduces a learnable correction model to enhance prediction interval efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CF-GNN achieves better coverage rates and smaller prediction intervals compared to baseline methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant problem by unifying CP and GNNs, contributing to the important area of uncertainty quantification.
- The method is well-motivated, with rigorous proofs establishing the validity of CP on graph data.
- Empirical results validate the effectiveness of CF-GNN, showing substantial improvements in coverage and efficiency.
- The writing is clear, and the technical contribution is substantial.

Weaknesses:
- The focus on a transductive setting is a limitation, as inductive settings are more realistic for GNN applications.
- The introduction of correlation datasets could be clearer, and the manuscript overlooks existing works on uncertainty quantification in GNNs.
- There is a lack of experimental comparisons with other conformal prediction methods, and the strict assumption of exchangeability raises questions about its applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the correlation dataset construction and address the absence of discussions on existing uncertainty quantification methods for GNNs. Additionally, we suggest exploring the inductive setting more thoroughly and providing experimental comparisons with methods like DAPS. Consideration of weighting samples based on node degree in coverage calculations could enhance the robustness of the approach. Finally, addressing the implications of exchangeability assumptions not holding would strengthen the manuscript.
