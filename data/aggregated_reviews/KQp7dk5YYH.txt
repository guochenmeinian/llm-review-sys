Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a post-prediction inference solution (PSPS) that integrates labeled and unlabeled data for efficient statistical inference across various machine learning models. The authors propose a unified framework for ML-assisted inference that simplifies the problem to estimating normal means, demonstrating asymptotic efficiency superior to existing methods. The framework is flexible, theoretically justified, and empirically validated on both simulated and real datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the proposed method, including sensitivity analyses and empirical evaluations.
- The main idea of reducing ML-assisted inference to a means estimation problem is compelling and well-articulated.
- The framework's flexibility allows it to work with established data analysis routines and machine learning models.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity on the unique advantages of the proposed method over existing transductive inference approaches, particularly regarding statistical power.
- Assumptions regarding i.i.d. distributions and the consistency of estimators are not thoroughly justified, raising concerns about the practical applicability of the proposed protocol.
- The discussion on the privacy-preserving aspect of the method is insufficient and lacks elaboration.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how the proposed method uniquely enhances statistical power compared to existing methods. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed justification of the assumptions related to i.i.d. distributions and the consistency of estimators. We also suggest expanding the discussion on the privacy-preserving feature of PSPS, potentially by providing a concrete use case. Finally, addressing the limitations of the framework more thoroughly would strengthen the paper's overall contribution.
