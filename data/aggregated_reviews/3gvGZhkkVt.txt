Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel neural network architecture, the State-Exchange Attention (SEA) module, designed for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in physical problems. The architecture facilitates information exchange between multiple fields and incorporates conservation quantities, leading to reduced errors and enhanced generalization. The authors evaluate the SEA module's performance in both single-phase and multi-phase 2D fluid settings, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- **Originality:** The SEA architecture introduces a unique cross-attention mechanism for physics-domain transformer models, enabling multi-directional information exchange between state variables.
- **Performance:** The SEA module effectively reduces rollout error accumulation, showing substantial improvements in both single-phase and multi-phase contexts.
- **Clarity:** The paper provides clear definitions, a logical structure, and detailed experimental results, making it accessible and well-presented.

Weaknesses:
- **Generalization Ability:** Further exploration of the model's generalization under complex boundary conditions is necessary. The evaluation is limited to specific instances of fluid dynamics, raising questions about performance in 1D and 3D settings.
- **Scalability Concerns:** The architecture's small size raises concerns about its scalability with larger models and more state variables.
- **Lack of Detailed Evaluation:** The paper lacks ablation studies and thorough evaluations of the SEA model components, as well as a rigorous definition of errors and their sources.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the exploration of the model's generalization ability by evaluating performance under more complex boundary conditions and in different dimensional settings. Additionally, presenting the training and inference costs of the model would provide a better assessment of its industrial applicability. We also suggest including ablation studies to clarify the contributions of SEA components to overall accuracy, and providing a rigorous definition of rollout errors along with graphical representations. Finally, addressing the scalability of the model with larger architectures and more state variables would enhance the paper's robustness.
