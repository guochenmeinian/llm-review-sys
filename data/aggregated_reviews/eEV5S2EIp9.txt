### Key Points
This paper presents a two-stage slot labeling method that effectively addresses data scarcity in multilingual scenarios. The authors propose a parsing approach that decomposes the task into two classification steps: first, a binary classifier identifies potential slot spans, and second, a sentence encoder trained with a contrastive objective classifies these spans. This method demonstrates superior performance compared to standard token classification, particularly in low-resource settings, and highlights the importance of the contrastive loss in enhancing model efficacy. However, the paper lacks a seq2seq baseline using pretrained multilingual language models, which are standard in parsing tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is sample-efficient, requiring minimal annotated data while achieving significant results across multiple languages.
- The empirical validation is thorough, with targeted ablations demonstrating the effectiveness of each component in the pipeline.
- The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, avoiding unnecessary complexity.

Weaknesses:
- There is a lack of evaluation on truly low-resource languages, with suggestions for using the MASSIVE dataset to enhance linguistic diversity.
- The comparison with established low-data learning techniques, such as IA3, is missing, which limits the contextual understanding of the method's effectiveness.
- The absence of formulas for the contrastive learning objective makes it challenging to fully grasp the methodology.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including more low-resource languages, potentially utilizing the MASSIVE dataset. Additionally, we suggest comparing the proposed method with data-efficient learning techniques like IA3 to provide a clearer context for its performance. Including the corresponding formulas for the contrastive learning objective would enhance understanding, and a solid comparison with seq2seq models should be integrated to strengthen the paper's claims.
