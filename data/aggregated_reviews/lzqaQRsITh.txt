Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a diffusion-based technique for 3D shape completion, introducing hierarchical feature aggregation and an occupancy-aware fusion strategy to enhance shape reproduction and detail preservation. The authors demonstrate that their method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance through extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments, outperforming existing methods significantly.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method clearly surpasses other state-of-the-art techniques.
- The visual quality of shape completions is commendable.
- The hierarchical feature aggregation and occupancy-aware fusion strategies are well-justified and validated through ablation studies.
- The integration of ControlNet for gradual learning at different scales is a strong design choice.
- Utilizing actual scan data rather than synthesized inputs enhances the method's applicability.

Weaknesses:
- The writing could benefit from simpler, more concise sentences, as many complex sentences hinder clarity.
- The motivation behind the technical designs, particularly the feature aggregation schemes, lacks sufficient explanation.
- The experimental design is unclear, particularly regarding whether the method trains on a single category or across multiple categories for fair comparison.
- The results from multiple conditional inputs appear unpredictable, necessitating clearer examples.
- The method's computational demands raise questions about its efficiency compared to part-based approaches.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their writing by simplifying complex sentences throughout the paper. Additionally, we suggest providing more detailed explanations of the design motivations for the feature aggregation schemes. To enhance experimental clarity, please specify whether DiffComplete is trained on a single category or across multiple categories. We also encourage the authors to include clearer examples of the results from multiple conditional inputs. Lastly, considering the method's computational limitations, we recommend exploring a part-based completion approach to potentially improve efficiency and understanding of geometry.
