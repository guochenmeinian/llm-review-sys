Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on posterior sampling using unconditional diffusion models, specifically through a "tilted transport" technique that integrates a linear inverse problem with denoising oracles to create a "boosted" posterior sampling framework. The authors investigate the feasibility of this approach concerning the properties of the measurement operator $A$, establishing conditions under which "boosted" posterior sampling is tractable. Additionally, the paper discusses the limitations of existing algorithms for posterior sampling in ill-conditioned scenarios and proposes a transport equation for easier sampling from transformed distributions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
* The subject matter is relevant and interesting to the machine learning community, with impactful theoretical contributions regarding posterior sampling.
* The paper is well-structured, with rigorous derivations and a clear presentation of the problem and necessary background.

Weaknesses:  
* The presentation is poor, with unusual notations and undefined concepts that hinder understanding. The formulation diverges significantly from standard diffusion models, complicating comparisons with existing literature.
* There is a lack of intuitive explanations and simplified examples, making the work less accessible to a broader audience.
* The absence of a concise algorithm description and poorly documented code limits practical applicability.
* The experimental results focus on low-dimensional scenarios that may not generalize well to broader linear inverse problems.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their presentation by defining all technical terms and notations, particularly those that differ from standard formulations. A thorough comparison with existing methods using conventional notations would enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest including intuitive explanations and simplified examples to make the theoretical contributions more accessible. The authors should also provide a clear algorithm description and improve the documentation of the provided code. Finally, we encourage the authors to consider extending their experimental evaluations to more general linear inverse problems and to include compelling baselines for comparison in the main text rather than relegating them to the appendix.
