### Key Points
This paper presents AlphaPruning, a novel framework for unstructured LLM pruning based on Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR) theory. The framework utilizes the heavy-tailed shape of empirical spectral densities (ESDs) in layer-weight matrices to allocate layer-wise sparsity more effectively, focusing on shape metrics rather than scale metrics. AlphaPruning has been empirically validated across various architectures, demonstrating significant improvements in performance and efficiency compared to existing methods, and shows strong generalizability to other compression techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The introduction of a novel sparsity allocation method leveraging the heavy-tailed shape of ESDs is a significant contribution to the literature.  
- Extensive validation across multiple LLM architectures shows substantial improvements in perplexity, accuracy, and computational efficiency.  
- AlphaPruning's adaptability allows it to integrate well with various model compression techniques, extending its applicability beyond LLMs to large vision model architectures.  

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty of the method for allocating sparsity based on layer quality is incremental, as similar ideas have been previously proposed.  
- The theoretical justification for the method is lacking, making it difficult for readers to fully grasp the underlying concepts.  
- The use of limited baselines may undermine the robustness of the findings, and stronger comparisons could enhance the work's impact.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical explanation of HT-SR theory and clarify its application within the method section to enhance reader comprehension. Additionally, we suggest exploring alternative mappings for layer quality to determine sparsity, such as computing the logarithmic of the metric before performing linear mapping. It would also be beneficial to include results on using AlphaPruning for layer-wise sparsity in other structured pruning methods, such as OSSCAR, and to compare the sparsity allocation of different layers with OWL for further insights.
