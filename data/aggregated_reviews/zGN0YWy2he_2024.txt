Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents "DisCo," a novel framework for generating complex images from structured scene graphs. The authors propose a Semantics-Layout Variational AutoEncoder (SL-VAE) to disentangle and generate diverse spatial layouts and interactive semantics from scene graphs. DisCo integrates these elements using a Compositional Masked Attention (CMA) mechanism within a diffusion model, enhancing generation control and rationality. Additionally, it introduces a Multi-Layered Sampler (MLS) for flexible, graph-based image editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DisCo outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating rational and controllable images.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation for disentangling layout and semantics from scene graphs is clear and novel.
2. DisCo shows significant improvements in image generation fidelity and diversity, as evidenced by IS and FID scores.
3. The authors conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies that validate the effectiveness of each component.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks quantitative comparisons with closely related baselines, such as R3CD, which could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.
2. Some generated images exhibit unnatural aspect ratios and stretched elements, indicating issues with object proportions and spatial embeddings.
3. The increased inference cost of DisCo, particularly due to the CMA mechanism, may limit scalability and efficiency.
4. The paper does not adequately address how to construct an exact scene graph, which is crucial for practical applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by reorganizing sections that are currently unclear, such as the multi-layered sampler. Additionally, including quantitative comparisons with closely related baselines would strengthen the evaluation of DisCo's performance. A discussion on the scalability of the proposed model, particularly regarding handling larger graph sizes and noisy scene graphs, would also enhance the paper. Finally, addressing the practical challenges of scene graph construction and comparing with recent data-centric methods like DALLE3 would provide valuable context for the proposed approach.
