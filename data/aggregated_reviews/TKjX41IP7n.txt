Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CoDet, a novel approach for open-vocabulary object detection that reformulates region-word alignment as a co-occurring object discovery problem. By grouping images that mention the same concept, CoDet establishes correspondences between shared concepts and common objects through co-occurrence, enabling effective region-region correspondences for object discovery. Experimental results indicate that CoDet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting novel objects and demonstrates scalability with visual representations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The authors propose a unique approach, CoDet, which diverges from reliance on pre-trained models, offering a fresh perspective in the field.  
- The paper is well-organized, providing a clear description of the methodology and demonstrating the effectiveness of CoDet through experimental results that validate its superior performance.  
- The clarity and coherence of the writing enhance reader understanding, and the provision of open-source code promotes reproducibility and further research.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks a comparative analysis with related work, particularly with the method "Aligning Bag of Regions for Open-Vocabulary Object Detection," which could clarify the unique contributions of CoDet.  
- The omission of VLDet in comparative tables raises concerns, necessitating an explanation for its absence to assess performance accurately.  
- Some technical details are confusing, such as the choice of backbones for different datasets and the fairness of comparisons with previous methods.  
- The motivation and methodology for discovering co-occurrence proposals need clearer articulation, particularly regarding visual appearance variations and similarity matrix changes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of how CoDet differs from existing methods, particularly by including a comparative analysis with "Aligning Bag of Regions for Open-Vocabulary Object Detection." Additionally, the authors should address the omission of VLDet in their comparative analysis and clarify the rationale behind the choice of backbones for different datasets to ensure fair comparisons. Furthermore, we suggest enhancing the clarity of the motivation and methodology for discovering co-occurrence proposals, particularly in relation to visual appearance variations and the presentation of the similarity matrix.
