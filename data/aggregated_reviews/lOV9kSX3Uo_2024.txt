Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a minimization problem involving $d$ probability distributions and generalizes the notion of quasar convexity by introducing different quasar-convexity parameters $\gamma_i$ for each distribution. The authors allow for more generic functions $F_i$ as oracle terms and establish convergence guarantees under Lipschitz continuous or polynomial-like interval functions. The paper also identifies infinite horizon reinforcement learning as a special case and extends results to the minimax setting.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Thorough theoretical analysis.
- The method requires strictly fewer iterations than mirror descent.
- The algorithm accommodates unknown $\gamma_i$ values.
- The application to reinforcement learning is significant.
- Extensive overview of related work.

Weaknesses:
- Algorithms 1 and 2 are only presented as pseudocode; additional explanation on how they differ from basic mirror descent is needed. The rationale for randomly picking $t$ with probability $\mathbb{P}[t] = 1/T$ is unclear.
- The paper provides only one example (the reinforcement application) to illustrate the new structure, raising questions about its sufficiency.
- The computational costs of the algorithm are not discussed; clarification on whether it is $d$ times more than basic mirror descent and its practical feasibility is necessary.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Algorithms 1 and 2 by adding 2-3 sentences to explain their differences from basic mirror descent. Additionally, we suggest providing more examples beyond the reinforcement application to justify the introduction of a new structure. It is also crucial to discuss the computational costs of the algorithm to assess its practicality. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the introduction's section regarding the costs associated with determining $\gamma_i$ values and to clarify the assumptions made for the GQC and GQCC conditions, including potential relaxations.
