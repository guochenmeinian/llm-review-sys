### Key Points
This paper presents TEARS (TExtuAl Representations for Scrutable recommendations), a novel recommender system that integrates natural language user summaries with traditional collaborative filtering methods. By employing large language models (LLMs) to create interpretable user preference summaries and utilizing optimal transport techniques to align these summaries with latent representations, TEARS enhances recommendation performance while providing transparency and user control. The authors conduct extensive evaluations across multiple datasets, demonstrating TEARS's effectiveness compared to standard models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The integration of LLMs for summarizing user preferences is innovative, yielding informative and unique user summaries.
2. TEARS shows improvements across various autoencoder-based models, supported by comprehensive experimental results.
3. The ablation study confirms the effectiveness of optimal transport in the proposed framework.

Weaknesses:
1. The definition of scrutable recommendations is unclear, as it is not a standard term in the field.
2. The reliance on LLMs raises concerns about technical novelty and potential biases in generated text.
3. The paper lacks a thorough discussion on the efficiency of the overall pipeline, particularly regarding summarization and optimal transport.
4. The originality of TEARS is limited, as it builds on existing frameworks without sufficiently addressing the limitations of text summaries in encapsulating rich numerical latents.
5. The paper is lengthy, which affects readability, and some experimental validations are confined to specific datasets, limiting generalizability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by providing a concise definition of scrutable recommendations. Additionally, we suggest discussing the technical advantages of using LLMs beyond generating user summaries, including addressing potential biases in generated text. The authors should analyze the overall pipeline efficiency, particularly the time costs associated with summarization and optimal transport. We encourage the authors to explore alternative alignment methods to enhance the robustness of their approach. Furthermore, we recommend compressing the content to improve readability and validating the approach across a broader range of datasets, including trending domains like e-commerce and short videos. Lastly, we suggest conducting user studies to assess the interpretability and effectiveness of the 200-word summaries and the user control mechanisms implemented in TEARS.
