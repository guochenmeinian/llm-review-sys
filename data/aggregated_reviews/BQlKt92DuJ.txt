### Key Points
This paper presents a method to enhance gaze estimation accuracy in wearable eye-tracking devices by addressing distortions caused by the parallax effect and implementing wearer-specific calibration. The authors propose two neural networks, CorNN and CalNN, trained independently to correct bias and improve calibration. The experiments involve a private dataset with 11 subjects, but the evaluation lacks clarity on the baseline model used and the rationale behind the choice of networks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The application of deep learning models to improve wearable eye-tracking accuracy is innovative.
- An ablation study provides insights into the necessary hyperparameters for optimal performance.
- Testing across different wearer types enhances the generalizability of the model's performance.
- The authors adequately explain their preprocessing steps.

Weaknesses:
- The baseline model for comparison is not clearly defined in the results.
- There is insufficient information on training hyperparameters, including epochs and sample validation.
- The inclusion of the training wearer in the test set introduces bias.
- The motivation for the choice of networks and the data augmentation strategy lacks justification.
- Figures, particularly Figure 5, require clearer presentation and explanation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the baseline model used for comparisons and provide detailed information on training hyperparameters, including the validation split of the dataset. It is essential to justify the inclusion of Wearer 0 in both training and testing datasets to avoid bias. Additionally, we suggest that the authors elaborate on the rationale behind the choice of networks and the data augmentation methods employed. Finally, we encourage the authors to refine the figures for better clarity and detail, particularly Figure 5, to enhance the overall presentation of results.
