### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Transformer model specifically designed for Symbolic Regression (SR), focusing on enhancing scientific discovery. The authors propose three encoder architectures, analyzing their flexibility and trade-offs regarding column-permutation equivariance. The study achieves state-of-the-art results on the SRSD datasets, supported by rigorous analysis and experimentation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of a Transformer model for SR represents a significant innovation in the field.
2. The thorough analysis of flexibility versus equivariance in encoder architectures enhances the paper's rigor.
3. Achieving state-of-the-art results validates the proposed model's effectiveness and potential applications.
4. Insightful discussions at the paper's conclusion contextualize its contributions within broader academic discourse.

Weaknesses:
1. Figures 2 and 3 show nearly identical errors across testing, validation, and training datasets, raising concerns about the results' authenticity.
2. The paper lacks references to important works on SR for scientific discovery.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors provide a more detailed analysis of Figures 2 and 3 to clarify the observed anomalies and ensure the results' validity. Additionally, we suggest incorporating data augmentation into the Mix architecture to enhance robustness and address the lack of equivariance. Finally, we encourage the authors to include the missing references on SR for scientific discovery to strengthen the paper's comprehensiveness.
