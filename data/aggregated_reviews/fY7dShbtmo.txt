Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Multi Time Scale State Space (MTS3) model, which employs a closed-form inference scheme across two time scales to enhance long-horizon predictions and uncertainty estimates. The model integrates a fast-timestep module for individual predictions and a slower module that updates over fixed intervals, controlling the fast module's behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that MTS3 significantly outperforms various baselines in predicting future states across multiple datasets, including simulations and real-world applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a critical challenge in world modeling by proposing a novel multi-time scale inference approach.
- The writing is generally clear, and the paper is well-organized, with a formal derivation of the method and comprehensive experimental validation.
- Robust performance is shown through extensive comparisons against valid baselines, with ablation studies highlighting important components of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental results do not convincingly demonstrate that the multi-time scale modeling is the primary factor for improved predictions, as other factors like imputation-based training may play a significant role.
- The absence of a baseline that updates both low-level and high-level states at the same frequency limits the evaluation of the proposed method's effectiveness.
- The model's reliance on state-independent linear dynamics raises questions about its ability to capture complex system behaviors, especially given the low-dimensional latent space used.
- There is a lack of experiments demonstrating the practical applications of the proposed method in real-world scenarios, and no code is provided for replication.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their experimental results by including a baseline where *H* is set to 1, allowing for a direct comparison of the multi-time scale approach. Additionally, the authors should clarify how they achieve strong performance with a linear model, especially in light of the discrepancies between their claims and the findings in Appendix A.3. Presenting a more general framework that accommodates arbitrary levels of hierarchy and non-linear dynamics could strengthen the paper's contribution. Finally, we urge the authors to provide their code and data to facilitate replication and further research in this area.
