Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning that addresses the prevalent issue of selection bias in labeled data. The authors propose a PU learning enhancement (PUe) algorithm based on causal inference theory, employing normalized propensity scores and inverse probability weighting (IPW) to reconstruct the loss function, yielding an unbiased estimate of the classifier. The paper also discusses the relationship between sample weights and propensity scores, emphasizing the use of inverse probability weighting for sample weight adjustments. The authors provide theoretical guarantees and empirical results to support their approach, demonstrating that the PUe algorithm significantly enhances classifier accuracy, particularly in datasets with non-uniform label distributions, including MNIST and CIFAR-10.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem of biased positive data is significant and practical, as existing methods often assume random selection of positive samples.
- The adaptation of causal inference to PU learning is original and sound, contributing to the field.
- The paper offers elegant theoretical guarantees and a tighter generalization bound.
- Empirical results robustly support the effectiveness of the proposed method across various datasets.
- The authors demonstrate responsiveness to reviewer feedback, indicating a commitment to refining their work.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity in explaining the connection between the bias issue and the causal inference method, particularly in the theoretical framework.
- There are numerous typographical and grammatical errors that detract from the overall quality and readability of the manuscript.
- The novelty of the approach is questioned, as it appears similar to existing works, particularly regarding the methodology and theoretical results.
- Key assumptions necessary for the validity of the proposed method, such as the known number of positive data in unlabeled data, are not adequately stated, leading to potential misunderstandings.
- There are unresolved concerns regarding the assumption that all selected positive data are anchor points, which may lead to estimation errors.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the connection between the bias in labeled data and the causal inference methods employed. A more detailed explanation of the causal assumptions and their relevance to the proposed method should be included. Additionally, we suggest that the authors conduct a thorough proofreading of the manuscript to correct typographical errors and enhance readability. To address concerns about novelty, we recommend that the authors provide a clearer comparison with existing literature, particularly the work presented at AAAI 2022, and highlight the unique contributions of their approach. Furthermore, it is essential to explicitly state the key assumptions, including the known number of positive data in unlabeled data, to avoid misunderstandings. We also suggest including a thorough discussion of the estimation error related to their method and considering incorporating anchor points from P data to strengthen their approach. Lastly, we advise improving the presentation of experimental results in Tables 1 and 2 to clearly indicate the best-performing algorithms.
