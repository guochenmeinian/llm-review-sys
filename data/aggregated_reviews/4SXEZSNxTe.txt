### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive study on query performance prediction (QPP) for dense retrieval, proposing coherence-based measures to evaluate models like ANCE and ColBERT. The authors aim to analyze the impact of query type on performance, highlighting its significance. However, the paper's claims regarding the superiority of coherence-based approaches over score-based methods, particularly in NDCG@10, are questioned, as score-based methods often yield better results. The paper also lacks clarity in certain sections, particularly in the explanation of equations and concepts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and generally easy to follow.
- It addresses an important topic in QPP and includes interesting statistical analyses.
- The motivation for the study is clear, and the coverage of related work is adequate.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed measures lack a solid theoretical foundation and are heuristic in nature.
- Performance results do not convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed measures over existing ones.
- Several sections contain unclear explanations, typos, and formatting issues, which hinder comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of section 3.1.1 by providing a detailed explanation of equation (2) and the terms used. Additionally, the authors should consider combining score-based and coherence-based approaches to strengthen their claims. It is essential to include more neural models in the evaluation to draw more substantial conclusions. We also suggest that the authors clarify how query types are determined and provide more details on the statistical analysis conducted. Finally, addressing the numerous typos and formatting errors throughout the paper will enhance its overall quality.
