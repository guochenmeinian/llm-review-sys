Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates malicious data update requests within the unlearning process, proposing two attack strategies: a static selective forgetting attack and a sequential selective forgetting attack. The authors formulate these attacks as a stochastic optimal control problem and provide both theoretical and experimental analyses to validate their effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The exploration of malicious machine unlearning is novel, addressing a previously unstudied area.
- The authors present well-justified one-step and multi-step attacks, analyzing their effects in various settings.
- The paper is well-structured, with clear research motivation and substantial theoretical support.

Weaknesses:
- The attack goals and methodologies lack clarity, particularly regarding the specific objectives of the attacks and how they differ in white-box versus black-box scenarios.
- Experiment details are insufficient, including the definition of target classes and the meaning of attack success rates.
- The paper does not adequately address related work on model poisoning, which is relevant to the proposed attacks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the attack goals by explicitly defining the objectives pursued by the attacker. Additionally, a high-level description of the attack execution process should be included. The authors should also provide more detailed experimental results, particularly regarding high-resolution datasets like ImageNet and VGG-Flower. Furthermore, we suggest incorporating results from membership inference attacks to assess the impact of selective forgetting attacks on their success rates. Lastly, a discussion on the potential limitations of the proposed attacks, including the realism of the sequential attack scenarios, would enhance the paper's robustness.
