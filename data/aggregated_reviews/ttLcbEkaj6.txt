Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for generating sketches from hand gestures using a self-supervised training procedure and data augmentation with an image diffusion model. The authors introduce AirSketch, which utilizes a ControlNet-based model trained primarily on the Quick, Draw! dataset, supplemented by real and synthetic hand gesture videos generated in Unity. The technique aims to produce clear sketches from noisy inputs and highlights the importance of text prompts for sketch generation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and provides a clear motivation for the research, particularly in AR/VR applications.
- It introduces a first-of-its-kind dataset and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed augmentation strategies.
- The experiments validate the model's ability to generate sketches that closely resemble ground truth.

Weaknesses:
- The approach may lack novelty, as it combines existing techniques and could be replicated using various models.
- There is insufficient detail regarding the hand tracker and the rationale for using only the Quick, Draw! dataset.
- The evaluation metrics are prone to errors, and the authors have not released the synthetic dataset, limiting reproducibility.
- The model's performance on unseen sketch classes and its generalizability beyond the training data remain unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the description of the hand tracker and provide a clearer justification for the choice of the Quick, Draw! dataset. Additionally, consider exploring the use of alternative datasets for generating synthetic data. The authors should address the limitations of the evaluation metrics used and provide insights into how the model handles jitters. It would also be beneficial to include visualizations of the model's performance and clarify the potential negative societal impacts of the technology. Finally, ensure that the code accompanies the paper upon submission for better reproducibility.
