### Key Points
This paper presents a meta-analysis of text summarization research, focusing on its alignment with responsible AI considerations. The authors meticulously developed an annotated dataset of summarization papers from ACL Anthology (2020-2022), which includes essential information such as paper goals, evaluation practices, and ethical considerations. The study systematically reviews the current state of responsible AI practices in summarization, revealing that implications of summarization work are not thoroughly reported.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The creation of a comprehensive annotated dataset facilitates further analysis in the field.
- The paper is well-structured and presents a systematic summary of research findings, supported by statistical evidence.

Weaknesses:
- The analysis is limited to metadata, neglecting valuable insights from the actual content of the papers.
- The findings lack clarity and coherence, making it difficult to understand the implications for responsible AI.
- The paper does not provide sufficient evidence to support its claims, often lacking concrete examples.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis by incorporating content from the papers to strengthen their findings. Additionally, we suggest providing clearer connections between the results and their implications for responsible AI, explicitly linking themes such as evaluation practices to ethical considerations. Including representative examples to substantiate claims would enhance the robustness of the arguments. Furthermore, addressing the relevance and prevalence of ethical AI issues in the context of summarization would provide valuable insights for researchers. Lastly, we encourage the authors to define abbreviations upon first use and consider adding visualizations to clarify complex findings.
