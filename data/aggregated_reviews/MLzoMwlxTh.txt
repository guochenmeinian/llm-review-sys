### Key Points
This paper presents a novel task called "Goal-Driven Clustering with Explanations" (GOALEX), which focuses on user-centric clustering and provides natural language explanations for clusters. The authors propose a three-stage algorithm, Propose-Assign-Select (PAS), which generates goal-related explanations, assigns text samples to these explanations, and utilizes integer linear programming to optimize cluster selection. The evaluation demonstrates that PAS produces more accurate and goal-oriented explanations compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a practical method for user-centric text clustering, enhancing understandability and applicability.
- The proposed algorithm is intuitive and effectively addresses the GOALEX task, supported by thorough analysis and experiments.
- The writing is clear, and the workflow figures are easy to understand.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on closed LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) raises concerns about reproducibility and potential test data leakage, as training data is not publicly available.
- The evaluation lacks sensitivity analysis regarding output variations due to prompt changes, and the handling of clusters of different sizes and noise is insufficiently explained.
- Some comparisons with baseline methods may be unfair, as they involve older models or those with significantly fewer parameters.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the robustness of their findings by conducting sensitivity analyses to measure output variations with different prompts. Additionally, clarifying how the proposed method manages clusters of varying sizes and noise would strengthen the experimental results. We also suggest that the authors emphasize their key innovations more prominently in the paper to enhance readability and impact. Lastly, addressing the assumption regarding the correctness of generated explanations would improve the overall rigor of the study.
