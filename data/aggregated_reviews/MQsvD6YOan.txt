### Key Points
This paper presents a framework, PQQ, aimed at augmenting low-resource question-answering (QA) datasets through a method that includes Prompt Answer, Question Generation, and Question Filter. The authors propose generating diverse candidate answers by filling masked answer slots and subsequently generating associated questions, which are filtered using a relevance evaluation module. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of PQQ across both high-resource and low-resource datasets, indicating its superiority over existing augmentation strategies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The experiments support the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing state-of-the-art results.
- Comprehensive evaluation across both high-resource (SQUAD1.1, TriviaQA) and low-resource datasets (PolicyQA, TechQA).
- The paper contributes to the understanding of QA data augmentation, particularly in the context of low-resource settings.

Weaknesses:
- The writing lacks clarity and some key details, which may hinder comprehension.
- The sensitivity of the answer generation method to answer/masking length is a concern, and the impact of the number of context-question-answer triples on performance is unclear.
- Limited novelty is noted, as the general approach has been explored in prior work, and more ablation studies are needed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and detail of the writing to enhance comprehension. Additionally, including preliminary analysis on the sensitivity of the answer generation method to answer/masking length would strengthen the paper. We suggest that the authors provide experimental results using Chat-GPT for each step in PQQ and apply the method to larger language models like LLaMA-7B. Finally, including more examples of the augmented dataset in the revised version would be beneficial.
