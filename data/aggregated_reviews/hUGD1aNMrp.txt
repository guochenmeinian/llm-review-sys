Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a unified framework for deriving lower bounds in interactive decision-making problems, adapting techniques from Chen et al. (2016) originally designed for non-interactive estimation. The authors propose a general formulation of the minimax value that includes both established and novel formulations, demonstrating the applicability of their lower bounding technique to rederive and tighten existing bounds, particularly through a new complexity measure termed "decision coverage."

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The general formulation and percentile-based technique for deriving lower bounds are appealing and presented clearly.  
- The paper introduces several new results, including interactive parameter estimation and tighter bounds for interactive reward maximization, which are expected to have a broad impact on the community.  
- The integration of classical techniques with contemporary methods provides valuable insights into statistical estimation and decision-making.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper contains numerous hand-waving arguments, leaving many gaps in the proofs that require the reader to fill in.  
- Some contributions appear overclaimed, particularly regarding the completeness of the characterization of sample complexity and the novelty of unifying different methods.  
- The presentation lacks clarity in several areas, making it challenging for non-experts to follow the arguments and understand the implications of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the proofs, particularly for Theorem 10 and Corollary 2, by providing more detailed steps and justifications. Additionally, we suggest addressing the concerns regarding the characterization of sample complexity in Theorems 12 and 13, ensuring that the claims made are substantiated with clear comparisons and examples. It would also be beneficial to explicitly define terms and clarify assumptions, such as the realizability assumption in Assumption 1, and to provide examples where Assumptions 2 and 3 hold. Finally, we encourage the authors to enhance the discussion on how decision coverage compares quantitatively to $\log |\mathcal{M}|$, as this would strengthen the paper's contributions.
