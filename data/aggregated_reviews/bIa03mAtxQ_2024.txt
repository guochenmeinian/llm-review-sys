Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Multilinear Mixture of Experts (µMoE) layer, which enables scalable expert specialization by performing implicit computation on large weight tensors in a factorized form. The authors propose that increasing the number of experts enhances specialization in vision tasks, supported by experiments on GPT-2 and MLP-Mixer models that maintain high accuracy. The comprehensive evaluation includes both qualitative and quantitative analyses, demonstrating the effectiveness of µMoE layers. Additionally, the authors argue that Sparse MoEs serve as a valid baseline due to their comparable memory footprint and reduced runtime costs compared to Dense MoEs. The experimental results show improvements in accuracy for CLIP fine-tuning and address concerns about the scalability of the approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. **Innovative Metric:** The introduction of a quantitative metric for "class-level polysemanticity" provides a clear measure of expert specialization.  
2. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** A broad range of experiments validates the effectiveness of µMoE layers, strengthening the argument for their utility.  
3. **Competitive Performance with Added Benefits:** µMoE layers compete effectively with larger models like GPT-2 and MLP-Mixer while offering additional interpretability.  
4. **Well-Motivated Approach:** The approach addresses an important goal in scalable expert specialization and is technically sound, supported by extensive qualitative and quantitative evidence.  

Weaknesses:  
1. **Limited Scope:** The focus on specific vision models and datasets may limit the generalizability of findings; expanding validation to diverse models (e.g., LLaMA, gemma) and datasets is recommended.  
2. **Lack of Robustness Analysis:** The paper lacks experiments assessing the robustness of µMoE layers on out-of-distribution data.  
3. **Need for Implementation Details:** There is insufficient disclosure of practical implementation details and computational requirements for µMoE layers.  
4. **Scalability Concerns:** Concerns about the scalability of the approach, particularly regarding performance on larger models like GPT-2, remain inadequately addressed, and the authors have not validated the performance of µMoEs on the largest scales of commercial LLMs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by validating µMoE layers on a wider range of models and datasets. Including robustness analyses on out-of-distribution data would enhance the understanding of the model's reliability. Additionally, providing detailed implementation guidelines and computational requirements would aid in reproducibility and practical application. We also suggest that the authors explicitly acknowledge the limitations regarding scalability in their revised paper, including a statement about the lack of experiments on the largest scales of commercial LLMs. Furthermore, clarifying the metrics used in the evaluation and including multiple runs for experimental results would strengthen the reliability of the findings. Lastly, we recommend addressing the comparison with Sparse MoEs and including a discussion on the speed of different methods, as these aspects are crucial for a comprehensive evaluation.
