Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for conformalized multiple testing following data-dependent selection procedures. The authors propose adapting the calibration set according to the selection rule to manage the distorted distribution resulting from the selection process. They prove that the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure's guarantees are maintained under the assumption of stable or weakly stable selection procedures. The method involves constructing selective conformal p-values and applying the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to these p-values, ensuring FDR control when the selection rule satisfies certain stability conditions. Experiments demonstrate the method's effectiveness and efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The problem of multiple testing after data-dependent selection is significant and well-addressed.
2. The formalization of selection stability and weak stability is comprehensive, with extensive theoretical proofs provided.
3. The experiments validate the proposed method's effectiveness and efficiency.

Weaknesses:
1. The methodological novelty is limited; adapting the calibration set with the selection strategy is not entirely new, as similar approaches exist in prior work. The main contribution may lie in the rigorous proof, which was not fully verifiable due to its length.
2. The paper lacks comparisons to key baselines, such as self-consistent adjustments and InfoSCOP, which are essential for a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method.
3. The technical contribution regarding the dependency between p-values for FDR control is only partially addressed, particularly under restrictive selection rules.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison of their method with key baselines, particularly self-consistent adjustments and InfoSCOP, to provide a clearer understanding of the trade-offs involved. Additionally, clarifying the technical contributions regarding the dependency between p-values and addressing the second problem of FDR control more comprehensively would strengthen the paper. It would also be beneficial to elaborate on the relationship between their conditional calibration approach and existing methods, such as the boosting technique discussed in Section 6 of the referenced work.
