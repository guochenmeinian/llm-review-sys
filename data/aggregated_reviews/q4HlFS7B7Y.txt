Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents VerT, a method for distilling verifiable models from black-box models by fitting a model \( f_v \) that reproduces the predictions of a black-box model \( f_b \) on a training set. The authors introduce a masking strategy that ensures the model's predictions remain self-consistent, thereby enhancing verifiability. Additionally, the paper discusses a framework for signal-distractor decomposition aimed at identifying spurious correlations in datasets, arguing that their method can reveal such correlations by analyzing the signal portion of the decomposition. The authors acknowledge the limitations of feature attribution methods, including their own, in detecting all sources of spurious correlations, particularly non-localized ones. The method is evaluated on three image datasets, demonstrating that VerT outperforms standard gradient-based feature importance methods. The theoretical framework of verifiability is also discussed, highlighting the limitations of off-the-shelf models in handling out-of-distribution (OOD) samples created by masking interventions. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- **Good writing.** The paper is clear and easy to follow, with intuitive notations.
- **Solid empirical validation.** Experiments convincingly verify key claims, showing that features identified by VerT significantly impact predictions and exhibit reasonable overlap with ground-truth salient features.
- The framework effectively formalizes the concept of signal-distractor decomposition and its relation to spurious correlations.
- The authors provide empirical evidence demonstrating the robustness of their method against noise and its performance on various datasets.

Weaknesses:
- **Restrictive assumption on replacement distribution.** The discussion on the choice of the replacement distribution \( \mathcal{Q} \) lacks consideration of important masking strategies, such as Gaussian blurs, which are conditioned on the input image. The authors should address whether masking strategies can be defined independently of the input without creating OOD examples.
- **Unrealistic signal-distractor decomposition.** The independence assumption between the mask \( \mathbf{m} \) and the signal \( \mathbf{s} \) is questionable, as demonstrated through examples. The authors should comment on the realism of their assumptions.
- The assumption of signal-distractor decomposition may not hold in all practical scenarios, leading to vacuous decompositions.
- The explanation of optimal predictors lacks clarity, particularly regarding how to ascertain their optimality in practice.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the choice of the replacement distribution \( \mathcal{Q} \) by including important masking strategies and acknowledging potential limitations.
- We suggest that the authors clarify the realism of the signal-distractor decomposition assumptions and consider revising them based on practical scenarios.
- We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their explanation regarding optimal predictors, specifically addressing how one can determine if a predictor is optimal.
- We suggest that the authors compare VerT with removal-based feature attribution methods like SHAP and DeepLIFT, as well as inherently interpretable models, to strengthen the evaluation.
- We encourage the authors to further explore the implications of vacuous decompositions in their framework and clarify the conditions under which non-vacuous decompositions can be expected to exist.
- We recommend including more challenging datasets beyond those with manually-defined spurious correlations to validate the method's robustness.
- The authors should ensure that hyperparameters are adequately described in the main text and address any missing references to figures or tables in the experiments section.
