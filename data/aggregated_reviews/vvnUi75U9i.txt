### Key Points
This paper presents a study investigating the effectiveness of two debunking approaches for fake news on social media: warning tags and AI-generated explanations using the GPT-4 model. The study, involving 215 participants and 24 news claims, asserts that both methods significantly reduce immediate belief in fake news and have long-term impacts, although the latter is less pronounced. The authors suggest future research could explore the combined use of these interventions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research addresses a critical societal issue regarding fake news, with significant real-world implications.
- It provides empirical evidence that both warning tags and AI-generated explanations can effectively lower immediate belief in fake news.
- The study raises important questions about intervention methods, fostering further exploration in this field.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks comprehensive results and analysis, relying solely on participant responses without automatic evaluation metrics.
- Details regarding the quality of generated explanations, experimental design, and participant demographics are insufficient.
- The validity of the human study is questionable due to potential biases and the lack of indicators like inner agreement.
- The comparison between the information volume of explanations and warning tags is not equitable, affecting the fairness of the study.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation of the generated explanations to address concerns about their accuracy and reliability. Additionally, providing more detailed information about the experimental setup, including the nature of news items and participant demographics, would enhance transparency. We suggest including robustness tests and clarifying the experimental design to strengthen the study's validity. Finally, exploring variations in the style and length of generated explanations could yield valuable insights into their effectiveness.
