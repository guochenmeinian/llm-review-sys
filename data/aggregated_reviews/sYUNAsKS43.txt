### Key Points
This paper presents CoPS, a cognitive system for personalized search that utilizes a three-stage memory system inspired by human memory. The authors propose that CoPS can effectively summarize, retrieve, and utilize personal information while relying on high-level text-based user profiles and fine-grained user interactions. The experimental results indicate strong performance, particularly in low-data scenarios. However, the justification for the necessity of this new model is vague, lacking empirical support and clear positioning against existing personalization models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- The contribution is original, with a sound experimental setup and thorough ablation studies.
- The organizational structure is reasonable, and the methods section is clearly articulated.

Weaknesses:
- The claim of efficiency in the analysis section is questionable, as the method requires multiple LLM inferences, which may incur high latency and resource costs.
- The motivations for the proposed framework are inadequately justified, with insufficient empirical evidence and references.
- The paper does not clearly explain the evaluation setup, including the number of document candidates for ranking and the average input token length.
- There are concerns regarding the reliance on large-scale LLMs like ChatGPT, which may limit practical applicability and raise questions about user privacy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and justification of the model's necessity by providing empirical evidence and references to existing challenges in personalization models. Additionally, the authors should address the latency and resource usage analysis of the proposed method, clarifying how candidates are identified and the implications of using LLMs at scale. It would also be beneficial to elaborate on the components that would run on-device versus server-side to enhance user privacy. Finally, the authors should provide more details on the evaluation setup, including the number of document candidates and the average input token length.
