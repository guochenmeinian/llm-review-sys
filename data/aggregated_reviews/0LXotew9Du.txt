Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents KVQuant, a method for low-bit activation quantization applied to the Key-Value Cache, addressing a significant bottleneck in long context LLM generation inference. The authors propose techniques such as per-channel, per-token, and non-uniform quantization tailored to the distribution characteristics of keys and values, as well as the distribution shift introduced by RoPE. The method demonstrates minimal perplexity degradation compared to FP16 and outperforms the latest KV quantization baseline (KIVI) in retrieval accuracy and LongBench performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The writing is clear and effectively communicates the kv-cache's role as a bottleneck in long context scenarios, emphasizing the need for quantization.
- The paper minimizes overhead through kernel optimization, showcasing the strengths of the proposed methods.
- Evaluation results are presented for both generation style (PPL) and long context prefill processing (longbench, longeval).
- The analysis of KV cache distributions provides valuable insights into quantization strategies.

Weaknesses:
- The paper focuses more on technical strategies rather than presenting innovative ideas, which may limit its perceived contribution.
- The extensive experimental results and numerous appendices can hinder readability, making it challenging to follow the main text.
- The evaluation section lacks detailed comparisons with existing KV cache compression methods and is limited to Wikitext-2 and C4 datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by filtering out extraneous details and emphasizing key points in the main text to enhance readability. Additionally, we suggest including more comprehensive comparisons with existing KV cache compression methods and evaluating the effectiveness of KVQuant on a broader range of challenging tasks, such as reading comprehension and code generation. Furthermore, a detailed explanation of the non-uniform quantization implementation and the specific method used to measure PPL would be beneficial.
