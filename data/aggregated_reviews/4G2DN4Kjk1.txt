Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an algorithm for linear regression that addresses heterogeneous data collected from multiple small batches. The authors propose a gradient-based method that improves upon previous works by removing restrictive assumptions, such as the requirement for isotropic Gaussian distributions. The solution's properties are analyzed through theoretical and numerical methods, demonstrating its applicability in real-world scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well-motivated and provides a comprehensive review of related works, effectively positioning its contributions within the existing literature. The algorithm's originality lies in its ability to tackle linear regression with fewer assumptions, achieving favorable theoretical guarantees. The clarity of the problem's contextualization and the innovative use of techniques like gradient clipping are commendable.

Weaknesses:  
The paper lacks a clear discussion on how the proposed solution recovers models for sub-populations with many subgroups, particularly compared to Kong et al. (2020). A detailed complexity analysis is missing, as the proposed method may introduce additional complexity. The experimental validation is insufficient, relying on a single baseline for comparison, and the results in Figures 1 and 2 show minimal variance that requires theoretical explanation. Additionally, there are multiple spelling errors and unclear statements that detract from the overall clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on how their solution handles large subgroups and clarify the complexity analysis to address potential concerns. A more comprehensive set of experiments comparing with multiple baselines would strengthen the claims made. The authors should also provide a theoretical explanation for the observed error rates in Figures 1 and 2. Furthermore, addressing the spelling mistakes and enhancing the clarity of statements, particularly in Theorem 2.3, would significantly improve the paper's presentation. Lastly, including a discussion on the implications of the algorithm when regression vectors lack separation would be beneficial.
