Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel generative framework called Classification Diffusion Models (CDMs) based on Density Ratio Estimation (DRE). It establishes a connection between denoisers in diffusion models and noise-predictive classifiers, enabling efficient likelihood computation in a single pass. The authors claim that CDMs are the first DRE-based technique to successfully generate images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, addressing challenges in likelihood estimation and demonstrating strong experimental results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The mathematical connection between DRE and diffusion models is clever and elegantly framed.
- The proposed method effectively motivates the use of Denoising Score Matching (DSM) to overcome saturation issues in classification-based training.
- The experiments convincingly verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods, showcasing comparable performance and scalability to existing diffusion models.

Weaknesses:
- The significance of the proposed method remains questionable, as the paper lacks sufficient discussion on the implications of efficient likelihood estimation for high-dimensional data.
- The computational complexity of CDMs is higher than that of traditional diffusion models due to the additional backward propagation required for each denoising step.
- The architecture changes necessary for implementation may hinder ease of use and direct comparisons with existing models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the significance of efficient likelihood estimation, particularly how it enhances the applicability of DRE-based methods in high-dimensional settings. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed analysis of the computational challenges associated with CDMs and exploring BP-friendly architectures to alleviate these inefficiencies. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the potential for training models without a classification objective, as this could broaden the applicability of their approach.
