### Key Points
This paper presents a methodology for automated corpus creation aimed at enthymeme detection and reconstruction in learner arguments, utilizing deep learning algorithms and NLP techniques. The authors propose a regression model for essay quality filtering, employing features such as ADU n-grams and sentiment flow, and utilize a PageRank-based approach for ranking candidate enthymemes. They claim to have produced one of the first corpora for systematically exploring these tasks and provide initial baselines for both detection and reconstruction.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a novel and significant task in argumentation analysis, potentially aiding in the automatic analysis of enthymemes.
- The methodology is well-documented and the corpus construction is creatively motivated.
- The paper is well-written and organized, making it accessible to readers.

Weaknesses:
- The paper is dense, with some sections (3.2 and 3.3) lacking thorough discussion and analysis.
- There is a missing human evaluation of the automatic method, which is essential for assessing the quality of the generated corpus.
- The simplification of the classification task raises concerns about its representativeness, and the low agreement scores among annotators indicate potential issues with the annotation process.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the depth of discussion in sections 3.2 and 3.3 to clarify their methodology. Additionally, conducting a human evaluation of the automatic method would provide valuable insights into the quality of the generated corpus. The authors should also consider addressing the simplification of the classification task and provide a rationale for the chosen approach. Finally, a manual analysis of the trained model on real enthymeme examples would enhance the paper's credibility and applicability.
