Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for comparing biologically plausible learning algorithms through the introduction of "Sp-locality," which delineates the necessary quantities for synaptic plasticity. The authors propose three definitions of locality: S-locality, p-locality, and Sp-locality, each addressing different aspects of synaptic updates. The framework categorizes various plasticity rules, facilitating the formulation of empirically testable hypotheses.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is technically sound, introducing formal definitions of locality and examining their implications. It is well-written, with examples and figures enhancing comprehension. The analysis allows for straightforward comparisons of learning rules, and the authors transparently outline the framework's limitations. The work addresses a significant gap in the literature regarding systematic evaluation of learning algorithms.

Weaknesses:  
Some properties derived from Sp-locality may not align with biological plausibility, raising questions about the framework's applicability. The framework does not sufficiently differentiate between various categories of locality, particularly regarding algorithms requiring global equilibrium versus those that do not. Additionally, the necessity of the general definition of locality is not well-substantiated, and the practical utility of the framework remains unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the framework by explicitly distinguishing between different categories of locality, particularly addressing the differences between algorithms like Equilibrium Propagation and simpler Hebbian rules. This should include a discussion of the implications of these distinctions on biological plausibility. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors clarify the added value of their mathematical formalization compared to natural language descriptions and provide intuitive explanations of the framework. Lastly, addressing the unresolved questions regarding testable predictions and the framework's limitations will strengthen the manuscript significantly.
