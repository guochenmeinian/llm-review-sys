### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach that integrates "Neuro Symbolic AI" and "Graph Neural Network" to address challenges in deep learning, such as reasoning, semi-supervised learning, and long-tailed issues. The authors propose a hierarchical taxonomy of class labels within the loss function of the classifier to enhance fine-grained classification of text documents.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The manuscript effectively integrates a well-designed hierarchical taxonomy into the neural network learning algorithm, leading to significant classification results.  
2. A new loss function is developed to compute both semantic loss and its gradient.  
3. The paper is well-written, covering relevant details and explaining concepts clearly, while discussing the limitations of existing supervised and semi-supervised methods.  
4. Detailed experimental results are provided in an ablation study.  
5. The evaluation includes two standard English datasets and one self-created Chinese dataset, demonstrating performance across different languages.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The architecture diagram of the proposed methodology lacks clarity; the authors are suggested to redraw it, emphasizing their contributions.  
2. The results section is weak; the authors need to rewrite the headings for clarity and elaborate on their findings, particularly in the ablation study, explaining each table.  
3. The related work section is insufficient; the authors are advised to update it with recent research addressing class imbalance issues, citing specific papers for reference.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the architecture diagram by highlighting their contributions. Additionally, the results section should be rewritten for better coherence, with more detailed explanations of findings and tables. Finally, we suggest updating the related work section with recent literature on class imbalance to strengthen the manuscript.
