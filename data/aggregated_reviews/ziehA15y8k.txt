Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach, MoE-BiEntIRL, to enhance the robustness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) against adversarial attacks in social media contexts, particularly for rumor detection. The authors propose an enhanced maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) method combined with a mixture-of-experts approach to reconstruct attack policies and generate additional adversarial samples. The method aims to improve GNN resilience through comprehensive feature-level explanations and real-world validation on datasets from Weibo and Pheme.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The application of inverse reinforcement learning to reconstruct adversarial attack policies is innovative and provides a unique perspective on enhancing GNN robustness.
2. The method's validation on real-world datasets demonstrates its practical applicability in social media rumor detection.
3. The approach facilitates a deeper understanding of attack behaviors through detailed feature-level explanations.

Weaknesses:
1. The method's complexity, involving multiple components, may hinder scalability and implementation.
2. Some theoretical aspects, particularly regarding IRL and mixture-of-experts, require clearer explanations for better understanding.
3. The term "Threat model" is used in an unconventional manner, which could lead to misunderstandings in the security community.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of sections discussing the theoretical underpinnings of IRL and mixture-of-experts to enhance accessibility. Additionally, a detailed discussion on the scalability of the method, particularly for large social media graphs, would be beneficial. We suggest including an actual threat model to strengthen the paper's acceptance in the security community. Furthermore, addressing minor issues such as typos and enhancing the description of the experimental setup will aid in reproducibility. Lastly, a brief analysis of parameter sensitivity and computational efficiency could enhance the practical application of the method.
