Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Bayesian optimization algorithm called COBOL that integrates human expert knowledge through a feedback mechanism utilizing binary accept/reject responses. The authors propose two key theoretical guarantees: the Handover Guarantee, which ensures a sublinear bound on the cumulative number of binary labels needed from experts, and the No-Harm Guarantee, which maintains a comparable convergence rate to traditional Bayesian optimization methods, even under adversarial conditions. Empirical results validate COBOL's effectiveness, demonstrating superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods in both synthetic benchmarks and real-world applications, particularly in lithium-ion battery design. The authors also introduce an adapted version of the algorithm with an additional theoretical improvement guarantee, emphasizing the trade-offs between robustness and improvement.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper provides comprehensive theoretical proofs supporting the proposed method, with clear notations and assumptions, establishing a robust mathematical foundation.
2. The integration of expert feedback in a binary format is innovative and avoids common issues associated with ranking approaches, with well-justified theoretical guarantees.
3. Extensive empirical results validate the algorithm's performance across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.
4. The organization and clarity of the paper are commendable, making complex concepts accessible to readers.

Weaknesses:  
1. The no-harm guarantee may be overstated, as it does not achieve the same optimum as vanilla methods within the same iterations under adversarial conditions, and the hyperparameter $\eta$ should be adjusted iteratively.
2. The theoretical contributions lack a clear demonstration of how human expertise improves the system compared to AI-only approaches, which is essential for validating the proposed method's effectiveness.
3. Clarity issues arise in notation and terminology, particularly regarding definitions of terms like "cost function" and "LL values," as well as the presentation of figures and algorithms.
4. The method's effectiveness may be limited to binary labeling, raising concerns about generalizability to more complex or continuous expert inputs.
5. The algorithm's reliance on Gaussian processes and the primal-dual method may lead to computational inefficiencies, particularly in high-dimensional settings, potentially limiting its practicality in real-time applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of notations and terminology throughout the paper, particularly in defining terms used in the algorithm and figures. Additionally, we suggest addressing the theoretical gap by providing a clearer analysis of how human expertise enhances the algorithm's performance compared to AI-only systems. The authors should also consider varying the hyperparameter $\eta$ with iterations to enhance the robustness of the no-harm guarantee. Furthermore, we recommend improving the discussion surrounding the improvement guarantee to clarify how the proposed algorithm performs when human input is beneficial and how it mitigates harm when human input is suboptimal. Addressing computational complexity concerns more thoroughly, particularly in high-dimensional spaces, by considering dimensionality reduction techniques and providing a comparative analysis of computational times with other baseline methods would also be beneficial. Lastly, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the trade-offs between improvement guarantees and robustness in the final version, as this aspect appears to be of significant interest to readers.
