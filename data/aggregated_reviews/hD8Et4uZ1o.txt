Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a reduction from dynamic regret minimization in Online Convex Optimization (OCO) to static regret minimization by embedding the comparator sequence into a higher-dimensional space. It establishes a trade-off between the penalties associated with comparator variability and loss variance, proving that achieving regret bounds based solely on squared path-length is infeasible. The authors introduce a new measure of variability, the locally-smoothed squared path-length, which offers a more practical approach to managing dynamic regret. Additionally, the paper provides a framework for reasoning about the trade-offs of measures of dynamic regret, emphasizing both upper and lower bounds. The authors clarify that the averaged squared path length is merely an illustrative example and not the main contribution, arguing that any new measure should be at least as effective as previous ones. They also discuss the importance of their framework in aggregating algorithms and addressing dynamic regret across various measures.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper establishes a novel equivalence between static and dynamic regret minimization, providing a unified framework for algorithm analysis and design.
- It offers deep insights into the inherent limitations and trade-offs in dynamic regret minimization, essential for developing effective algorithms.
- The introduction of the locally-smoothed squared path-length reduces variance penalties and facilitates the decoupling of regret terms, leading to more robust dynamic regret bounds.
- The authors effectively clarify the main contribution of their work, focusing on the framework for analyzing dynamic regret trade-offs.
- They provide detailed explanations and justifications for their claims, particularly regarding the relationship between different path length measures.
- The paper engages constructively with reviewer feedback, indicating a willingness to improve clarity and presentation.

Weaknesses:
- The title may overstate the results, as the reduction primarily applies to Online Linear Optimization (OLO), and its applicability to broader dynamic regret minimization problems remains unclear.
- The high-dimensional embedding could significantly increase computational complexity, which should be discussed in the context of large-scale applications.
- The paper lacks intuitive examples or case studies to illustrate practical applications of dynamic regret, making it harder to understand the implications of the proposed reduction.
- The reasons for choosing the locally-smoothed squared path-length are not adequately justified, and its detailed nature may obscure empirical intuitions.
- The introduction may not adequately emphasize the framework's primary contributions, leading to potential misunderstandings about the focus of the work.
- Some reviewers express concerns about the generality of the proposed reduction and its applicability to various functions, suggesting that the claims may be overstated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the title and abstract to accurately reflect the scope of their results, particularly regarding the applicability of the reduction beyond OLO. Additionally, we suggest discussing the computational complexity associated with the high-dimensional embedding to address concerns about real-time implementation. Including intuitive examples or case studies would enhance understanding of dynamic regret in practical scenarios. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the rationale behind the choice of the locally-smoothed squared path-length and its implications for empirical interpretations. We also recommend improving the introduction to clearly emphasize the main contributions of the framework, particularly regarding trade-offs in dynamic regret measures. Providing further explanations about the relationship between the averaged squared path length and standard path length would clarify the impact of the $\max$ operator. Finally, we encourage the authors to refine their claims about the generality of their framework, ensuring that the limitations and specific conditions for applying their results are clearly articulated throughout the paper.
