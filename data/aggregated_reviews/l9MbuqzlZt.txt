Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel algorithm for solving the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) problem with quadratic cost, specifically focusing on low-dimensional point clouds. The authors reformulate the GW problem into a sequence of concave optimization problems over convex sets, enhancing computational efficiency. The algorithm alternates between globally solving a concave minimization problem and improving the feasible set through cutting planes. The authors demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness through comparative evaluations against existing methods, showing significant improvements in computational speed. Additionally, the paper claims convergence to a global optimum or indicates proximity to it, but the theoretical results require clearer justification, particularly regarding the low-rank structure of the problem and the relaxation used in their approach. The experiments primarily compare their algorithm with an entropic-regularized solver, which may mislead readers regarding the nature of the problem being addressed.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a novel algorithm that offers a fresh perspective on computing the GW distance for low-dimensional point clouds.
- The algorithm is recognized as clever and innovative, likely ensuring acceptance.
- The clarity of presentation effectively communicates methodologies and findings, particularly the general idea and theoretical aspects.
- The algorithm demonstrates significant computational efficiency improvements in experiments.

Weaknesses:
- Limited experimental testing, primarily on synthetic data, raises concerns about the algorithm's performance on diverse real-world instances.
- The theoretical results lack sufficient justification for readers unfamiliar with the standard form of the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP).
- The convergence proof relies on asymptotic behavior, which may not adequately address practical convergence rates.
- The experimental comparisons are limited, primarily focusing on an entropic-regularized solver rather than a non-regularized one, which may obscure the performance gains of the proposed algorithm.
- The paper lacks a complexity analysis for the proposed algorithm, which could enhance its rigor.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including a wider variety of real-world instances, such as shape/object matching, to better demonstrate the algorithm's robustness. Additionally, we suggest improving the presentation of the theoretical results by including justifications for the low-rank structure and the relaxation used, as these concepts may not be familiar to all readers. Clarifying that the comparison with the entropic solver involves specific regularization parameters would also be beneficial. We recommend separating Figure 2 into two distinct figures to enhance clarity regarding the goals of the experiments. Furthermore, a discussion on the convergence rate and approximability of the low-rank QAP would be advantageous. Lastly, including a complexity analysis of Algorithm 1 would provide a clearer understanding of its computational demands and enhance the paper's rigor.
