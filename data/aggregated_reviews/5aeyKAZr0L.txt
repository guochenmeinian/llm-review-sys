Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of equivariant graph networks, focusing on the bias-variance tradeoff in the context of fixed graphs and approximated symmetries through graph coarsening. The authors formalize the statistical risk associated with linear regression under these symmetries and provide empirical validation through experiments on human pose estimation and traffic flow prediction. Notably, the work introduces the concept of using Graphons to define metrics over graph spaces, which could have broad applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a novel perspective on equivariant graph networks, particularly regarding fixed graph scenarios and approximated equivariance via graph coarsening.
- The theoretical claims are articulated clearly, providing valuable insights into the bias-variance tradeoff.
- The introduction of Graphons as a metric for graph spaces is innovative and relevant.

Weaknesses:
- The main text lacks a detailed explanation of clustering methods and how to coarsen a graph, particularly in the traffic flow experiment.
- The experimental section is difficult to navigate, as all implementations are relegated to the appendix, and additional details on the architectures used would enhance understanding.
- Empirical results do not convincingly demonstrate the necessity of approximated equivariance, and the experiments focus on specific tasks rather than general graph tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the main text by providing a clearer description of the graph coarsening methods and their application in the experiments. Additionally, including more comprehensive experimental results on general graph tasks, such as link prediction, would strengthen the paper. Clarifying the significance of the risk gap as a model selection criterion and addressing the mismatch between theoretical claims and experimental practices would also enhance the overall coherence of the work.
