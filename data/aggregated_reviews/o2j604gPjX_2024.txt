**Key Points**  
The paper introduces EROM, a novel approach for designing reward functions in reinforcement learning (RL) using Multimodal LLMs. The authors highlight limitations of previous methods that focused solely on textual and numerical data, advocating for the inclusion of visual data like images and videos to enhance model comprehension and reward function accuracy.

**Strengths and Weaknesses**  
We appreciate the innovative integration of visual data into the reward function design, which could significantly improve model performance. However, the paper lacks comprehensive comparisons with more baseline models and insufficient experimental validation.

**Suggestions for Improvement**  
We suggest comparing EROM with a broader range of baseline models and conducting additional experiments to strengthen the findings and validate the proposed approach.
