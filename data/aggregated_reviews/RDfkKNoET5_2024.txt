### Key Points
This paper presents two modifications to the relative representation approach: a transformation from absolute to relative representations that is invariant to combinations of permutations, element-wise rescalings, and shifts, and a fine-tuning method based on topological densification. The authors argue that their transformation is nearly as expressive as the original in high dimensions, with experiments suggesting improved performance for the task considered. However, the motivation for the second modification is less clear, particularly regarding its invariance properties and relevance to non-supervised settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The theoretical motivation for the proposed mechanisms, particularly the normalization procedure, is clear and well-articulated.
- The application of topological data analysis to relative representations is innovative and aligns with trends in invariant representation learning, demonstrating empirical performance improvements in low-data regimes.

Weaknesses:
- The clarity of the paper is inconsistent; while some sections are well-articulated, others may overwhelm readers lacking a background in topology or geometric deep learning.
- The reported baseline performance raises concerns about the method's implementation, and the limited scope of experiments compared to prior work undermines the credibility of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by comparing the equations for the transformations side by side or numbering them for easier reference. Additionally, the authors should provide stronger justification for the reported baseline performance discrepancies and expand the experimental scope to include more datasets and languages. Further analysis of the computational complexity and efficacy of the topological loss is also necessary to determine its value relative to batch normalization. Finally, enhancing the presentation of results, particularly through clearer labeling of figures and combining tables for better readability, would improve the overall quality of the paper.
