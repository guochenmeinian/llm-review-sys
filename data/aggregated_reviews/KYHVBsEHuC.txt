Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DiffuPac, an innovative adversarial packet generation method designed to evade detection by Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). It integrates BERT for semantic understanding and a diffusion model for seamless packet integration, demonstrating superior evasion capabilities compared to traditional methods. The experimental results indicate that DiffuPac significantly outperforms existing approaches, establishing new benchmarks for adversarial packet generation. Additionally, the authors express a commitment to thoroughly address all feedback received during the review process by increasing the necessary experimental evidence, proposing that the additional data and analysis will alleviate the reviewers' concerns.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a novel adversarial packet generation scheme that effectively tests the evasion detection ability of NIDS.
2. The methodology is well-articulated and easy to follow, showcasing a clear explanation of the proposed strategy.
3. Experimental results support the effectiveness of DiffuPac in bypassing detection.
4. The authors demonstrate a willingness to engage with reviewer feedback and improve their work by incorporating more experimental evidence.

Weaknesses:
1. The efficiency of DiffuPac is a primary concern, as the diffusion model may be time-consuming. Additional experiments are needed to validate its efficiency.
2. The functionality preservation of the generated adversarial packets remains unverified, raising questions about their practical utility.
3. The evaluation lacks a diverse set of baselines, limiting the comparative analysis of DiffuPac's performance against other methods.
4. The initial submission did not fully address the reviewers' concerns, indicating potential gaps in the original analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the efficiency validation of DiffuPac by conducting experiments that assess its performance in real-time scenarios. Additionally, it is crucial to include analyses that evaluate the functionality of the adversarial packets to ensure they perform as intended. We suggest expanding the evaluation to include multiple baselines for a more comprehensive comparison. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide a detailed threat model that clarifies the operational settings of DiffuPac, particularly in relation to encrypted traffic and signature-based NIDS. Lastly, addressing the potential limitations of the CICIDS2017 dataset and ensuring the preservation of malicious functionality in generated packets should be prioritized. We also recommend that the authors ensure that all feedback is comprehensively addressed in the revised version, particularly through the inclusion of robust experimental data and analysis.
