Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a formalization of the class of planning problems solvable by relational neural networks, aiming to bridge the gap between the expressivity of these networks and the complexity of planning problems. The authors define a serialized goal regression rule and search algorithm, categorizing planning problems into three classes based on this search. Empirical experiments in two planning domains demonstrate the implications of the proposed approach. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel method for quantifying the complexity of planning problems.
- It is the first analysis of which planning problems can be solved by neural networks.
- The formal analysis enhances evaluations of neural approaches for planning problems.

Weaknesses:
- Some notations lack clarity, particularly in Algorithms 1 and 2, where terms like `goal stack`, `goal_set`, and the role of $\pi$ need definition.
- The paper does not sufficiently discuss the practical applications of the theoretical contributions.
- The experimental results are limited in scope, lacking a broader discussion on applicability to real-world scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of notations, particularly by defining `goal stack`, `goal_set`, and ensuring that action inputs are clearly stated in Algorithms 1 and 2. Additionally, we suggest providing a more extensive discussion on the practical implications of the theoretical findings, including a list of environments with their properties. Expanding the experimental scope to include more diverse planning problems would strengthen the paper's impact. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the relationship between their findings and traditional relational learning approaches, as well as to address the limitations of their work more thoroughly.
