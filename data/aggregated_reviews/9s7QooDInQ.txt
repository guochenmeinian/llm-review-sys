Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents schema-guided prompting to develop task-oriented dialog systems (TOD) using large language models (LLM) in zero-shot settings. It introduces a Dialog State Tracking Prompter for explicit dialog state tracking and a Policy Prompter for directing response generation. The authors benchmark their approach, SGP-TOD, on datasets such as MultiWoZ 2.0/2.2, RADDLE, and STAR, achieving significant zero-shot performance improvements. The paper also includes human evaluations, enhancing its contributions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method demonstrates strong performance across various benchmark datasets.
- The paper presents a clear and flexible prompting-based technique for addressing all TOD sub-tasks in an end-to-end manner.
- It provides sufficient support for its claims and deepens understanding in the field.

Weaknesses:
- Analyses do not adequately support the effectiveness of the two prompters, particularly regarding the contribution of the DST prompter.
- Human evaluation results are limited to comparisons with an outdated baseline, raising concerns about their convincingness.
- The complexity of the prompting setup may detract from its practical applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the two prompters to clarify their individual contributions to performance. Additionally, it would be beneficial to compare human evaluation results against more recent baselines to enhance credibility. We also suggest discussing parameter counts in relation to the results, as this could provide valuable context regarding model performance. Finally, addressing how the dialog flows in the Policy Prompter differ from few-shot exemplars would strengthen the zero-shot claim.
