Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for semi-supervised deep regression problems using contrastive learning, focusing on leveraging unlabeled data by aligning feature similarity with ordinal ranks. The authors utilize spectral seriation algorithms to recover accurate ordinal relationships, demonstrating the method's effectiveness through real-world medical imaging experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper effectively employs contrastive learning for unlabeled data while considering the ordinal relationship.
2. The use of spectral seriation enhances overall contrastive performance.
3. The method shows significant results in medical imaging applications, supported by theoretical foundations.

Weaknesses:
1. The model design section lacks clarity, particularly regarding the optimization of equation (7).
2. Some descriptions are ambiguous, such as unclear references in lines 3 and 28, and the term "Fiedler vector" in line 105.
3. Typos are present, including "ofL" in line 105 and unclear notation in equation (7).

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of descriptions, particularly in the model design section, and provide explicit explanations for terms like "Fiedler vector." Additionally, we suggest revising the related work section to include more relevant references and relocating it to Section 1 after the Introduction. The authors should also clarify the meaning of $R^{'} - R^{'}_{[i]}$ in equation (7) and consider including ablation studies on loss components and hyperparameters. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore the computational complexity of their method and its performance on diverse datasets beyond medical applications.
