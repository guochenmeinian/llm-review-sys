### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of the discrepancies between a language model's external predictions and those derived from probing its internal representations. The authors categorize these mismatches into three types: confabulation, deception, and heterogeneity. They utilize three binary QA datasets to demonstrate that combining internal and external predictions can enhance overall accuracy. The findings suggest that disagreements are not primarily due to deception, challenging the notion that language models intentionally mislead.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a valuable taxonomy for categorizing mismatches, which can serve as a foundation for future research.
- It provides substantial empirical results that support the claim that disagreements between probes and queries are not typically due to deception.
- The synergy between probing and querying is an interesting contribution to the understanding of language models.

Weaknesses:
- The paper overstates its contributions, particularly in claiming to identify reasons for mismatches, which are more accurately described as observations.
- There is limited experimentation regarding probing methods, prompts, and tasks, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the nature of the discrepancies.
- The presentation is confusing in several areas, leading to misunderstandings about key concepts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their presentation, particularly in defining terms such as "confabulation" and "deception," to avoid confusion. It is essential to specify whether "incorrect queries" refer to the input queries or the model's predictions. Additionally, we suggest expanding the experimentation to include various probing techniques and hyperparameter settings to strengthen the claims made. Finally, we advise the authors to clarify the distinction between confidence and accuracy throughout the paper to enhance reader comprehension.
