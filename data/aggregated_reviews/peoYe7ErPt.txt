### Key Points
This paper presents a new synthetic complexity score for drug discovery, augmented by human expertise. The concept is intriguing, but the backbone representation functions are relatively simple. The authors propose exploring extensions to more advanced deep learning models for molecular analysis in future work.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed synthetic complexity score is a novel contribution to the field of drug discovery.  
- The integration of human expertise adds value to the score's development.  

Weaknesses:  
- The backbone representation functions are considered too simplistic.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the complexity of the backbone representation functions and explore the application of more advanced deep learning models for molecular analysis in future iterations of their work.
