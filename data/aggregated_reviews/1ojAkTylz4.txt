Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method, adaptive noise schedule for time series diffusion models (ANT), which addresses the unique properties of time series data, particularly non-stationarity. The authors propose an algorithm for selecting an adaptive noise schedule, which gradually corrupts time series data, contrasting with the abrupt changes seen in linear scheduling. The paper introduces the ANT score to quantify non-stationarity and demonstrates the necessity for tailored scheduling across different datasets. Extensive experiments validate the method's effectiveness in various time series tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The originality of the ANT method for adaptive noise scheduling in time series is notable, marking a significant advancement in the field.  
- The introduction of the ANT score and the extensive experimental validation across multiple datasets and tasks enhance the paper's quality and credibility.  
- The clear structure and accessibility of the paper facilitate understanding for readers with varying backgrounds in diffusion models.  

Weaknesses:  
- The evaluation details are limited, particularly regarding the calculation of metrics for time series forecasting and the data fractions used for inference.  
- The candidate schedules are manually set, raising concerns about the potential exclusion of optimal schedules.  
- The ANT score's simplicity may not adequately guarantee the quality of the selected schedules, and the paper lacks a theoretical analysis of its effectiveness.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the language in several sections to eliminate ambiguity, such as in the statement regarding the appropriateness of schedules for time series data. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more detailed explanation of the experimental evaluations, including the calculation of metrics and the evaluation methods used. It would be beneficial to include a quantitative summary of the main results in the conclusion. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore the generalizability of the ANT method across different diffusion models and to consider extending the noise functions beyond linear, cosine, and sigmoid to enhance the applicability of their findings.
