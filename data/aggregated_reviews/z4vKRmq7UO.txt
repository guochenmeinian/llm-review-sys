Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel regularization term for conditional GANs (cGANs) that combines an L1 penalty with a standard-deviation reward to enhance the generation of high-quality samples in image recovery tasks, specifically MRI reconstruction and face image inpainting. The authors evaluate their approach against existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness through numerical results. The work addresses the lack-of-diversity issue in posterior sampling from cGANs and shows that the proposed method outperforms traditional U-Net and other score-based approaches in terms of accuracy and speed. Additionally, the authors focus on fast and accurate posterior sampling in MRI, emphasizing uncertainty quantification. They acknowledge that while 8X acceleration yields interesting images, it may not meet clinical acceptability and plan to add limitation statements regarding this issue. The authors also recognize the need for validation with pathology-centric studies to ensure clinical relevance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed regularization term is straightforward to implement and enhances GAN models.
2. The authors provide a comprehensive discussion of various regularization options and their limitations.
3. The paper includes both theoretical analysis and empirical results, contributing to the understanding of the proposed method.
4. The writing is clear and well-organized, making the content accessible.
5. The authors have addressed reviewer concerns by proposing limitations and additional results, which enhance the paper's credibility.
6. The quantitative performance of the proposed approach is competitive with state-of-the-art methods.
7. The focus on uncertainty quantification is a significant contribution to the field.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the paper is somewhat limited, as the use of supervision-L1 for regularizing cGANs has been previously proposed.
2. The experimental tasks focus solely on linear image restoration, leaving questions about performance on nonlinear tasks.
3. The low-resolution datasets used in experiments raise concerns about the method's scalability to higher-resolution images.
4. The determination of the hyper-parameter \(\beta_{adv}\) for different datasets lacks clarity.
5. Some writing inconsistencies and technical details could be improved for better clarity.
6. The relevance of perceptual metrics in MRI remains unclear, as traditional metrics like PSNR do not correlate well with radiologists' ability to diagnose.
7. The choice of the parameter \(P\) may significantly affect reconstruction results, raising questions about the practical applicability of the algorithm.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty aspect by clearly differentiating their contributions from existing work, particularly regarding the regularization term. Additionally, conducting experiments on nonlinear image inverse problems would strengthen the paper. It would be beneficial to evaluate the proposed method on more complex real-world datasets and higher-resolution images to assess its robustness. Clarifying the methodology for determining the hyper-parameter \(\beta_{adv}\) and addressing the writing inconsistencies would enhance the overall presentation. We also suggest that the authors improve the limitations section to explicitly address the need for validation with pathology-centric studies. Furthermore, we recommend clarifying the relevance of perceptual metrics in MRI and providing more context on how the choice of \(P\) impacts reconstruction quality, particularly in relation to the perception-distortion tradeoff. Lastly, expanding the discussion on the limitations, particularly regarding the clinical applicability of the results and the reliance on ImageNet features for medical imaging, would provide a more comprehensive view of the work's implications.
