### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of the effect of factuality on methods for factual knowledge injection in pre-trained language models. The authors assess whether knowledge injection methods effectively inject knowledge and examine the impact of the factuality of this knowledge on downstream performance across various tasks. The findings indicate that while knowledge injection does occur, the correctness of the injected knowledge has a limited effect on performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides an interesting and insightful analysis of knowledge injection, challenging existing assumptions about its impact on downstream tasks.
- The experimental setup is technically sound and appropriate for the claims made.
- The proposed counterfactual-based analysis framework is well-designed and convincing.

Weaknesses:
- The framing of results is unclear, particularly regarding the relevance of downstream evaluations in assessing knowledge injection.
- The title may mislead readers by not specifying that it addresses the impact of correct factual knowledge.
- The limited scale of experiments raises questions about the generalizability of the conclusions across different pre-trained models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper's framing and narrative, focusing more on evaluation rather than solely on models. It would be beneficial to narrow down claims and present them more forcefully. Additionally, we suggest including representative work on current knowledge-augmented pre-trained models to strengthen the arguments. Finally, expanding the experimental scope to include other models like RoBERTa and ALBERT could enhance the robustness of the findings.
