Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the SUGARCREPE++ dataset, which enhances the original SugarCrepe benchmark to evaluate the semantic and lexical understanding capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) and unimodal language models (ULMs). The dataset includes images paired with three captions: two semantically equivalent but lexically distinct positives and one hard negative. The authors claim that existing models struggle with semantic and lexical variations, attributing this issue to inadequate text encoders. Additionally, the paper analyzes syntactic and lexical similarity in captions, highlighting the challenges faced by various VLMs in identifying negative examples. The authors demonstrate that models excelling in compositionality may not perform well on this dataset and introduce new experimental results using VGPTScore and VQAScore, indicating that generative VLMs can outperform discriminative models with appropriate inference techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-structured and clearly articulates the research question, making it accessible.  
- The proposed benchmark is novel, addressing the challenge of semantic equivalence in VLMs.  
- Comprehensive evaluations across various models provide insights into the impact of different architectures and training data on performance.  
- The dataset generation and validation process is thoroughly documented, ensuring reproducibility.  
- The introduction of SUGARCREPE++ and the discussion of its distinct properties enhance the understanding of semantic equivalence.  
- The new experiments with VGPTScore and VQAScore are compelling and suggest avenues for further research.

Weaknesses:  
- The necessity of addressing language understanding in a multimodal context is not sufficiently emphasized.  
- The claim regarding text encoders as bottlenecks appears trivial given the benchmark's design.  
- The paper lacks a clear definition of "semantic" and "lexical" variations, which could confuse readers outside the NLP field.  
- There is limited exploration of the dataset's distribution and a lack of comparisons with other datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness.  
- The presentation of previous works may distract from the main contributions of the paper.  
- Some models showed performance degradation on SC++, raising questions about the reliability of compositionality as a predictor for semantic understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definitions for "semantic" and "lexical" variations, ideally including numerical metrics to aid understanding for non-NLP readers. Additionally, the authors should emphasize the importance of enhancing text encoders in relation to multimodal tasks and consider including evaluations of existing methods that address model consistency. We suggest improving the organization of the introduction to minimize distractions from the main contributions while still acknowledging previous works. Clarifying the differences in performance between SC and SC++ would better highlight the distinctiveness of the datasets. Expanding the discussion on the dataset's distribution and comparing model performances across different datasets would also strengthen the paper. Finally, simplifying complex sentences and providing concrete examples would enhance readability and comprehension, as well as expanding on the implications of their findings regarding the performance of generative VLMs in the final version of the paper.
