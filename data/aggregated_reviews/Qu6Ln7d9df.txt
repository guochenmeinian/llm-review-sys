Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Streaming Factor Trajectory Learning (SFTL), which addresses the limitations of traditional tensor decomposition methods that only estimate static factors for temporal data. The authors propose using a Gaussian process (GP) to model factor trajectories over time, allowing for efficient handling of streaming data without the need to store previous data. SFTL demonstrates good performance in recovering nonlinear factor trajectories and outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in both online and final predictive performance on real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- SFTL efficiently captures temporal dynamics using a Gaussian process, enhancing the ability to model nonlinear features.
- The authors employ elegant techniques to reduce computational complexity, particularly by converting the GP into a linear time-invariant stochastic differential equation (SDE).
- The paper is well-written, with clear notation and a thorough discussion of hyperparameter sensitivity.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity in certain sections, particularly regarding the contributions in Sections 3 and 4, and the real-world applications are not sufficiently explained.
- The assumptions regarding the smoothness of factor trajectories may be restrictive, and the implications of continuity in the latent space are not adequately discussed.
- The notation is complex, making it difficult to follow, and the paper does not address alternative methods like Tensor Train or Tensor Ring decompositions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Sections 3 and 4 to better articulate their contributions and provide more detailed explanations of the real-world applications of SFTL. Additionally, we suggest discussing the implications of the assumptions made regarding the Gaussian process and the continuity of factor trajectories. Simplifying the notation would enhance readability, and including comparisons with alternative decomposition methods could provide a broader context for their approach. Finally, we encourage the authors to add experiments with dense data to evaluate the method's applicability in different scenarios.
