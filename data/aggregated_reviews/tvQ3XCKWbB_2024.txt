Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the relationship between logical definitions of disentanglement and quantitative metrics, proposing a systematic approach to derive metrics from these definitions. The authors utilize topos theory and enriched category theory to theoretically justify their metrics and empirically demonstrate their effectiveness in isolating aspects of disentangled representations compared to existing metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The systematic method of converting logical predicates into quantitative metrics is novel and interesting.  
- The theoretical support using topos theory and enriched category theory is sophisticated and adds depth to the work.  
- The paper provides theoretical justification for the proposed metrics, which have practical implications regarding differentiability.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper is poorly motivated, structured, and written, making it difficult to follow the authors' objectives and the significance of their work.  
- The experimental setup is inadequately described, with important details relegated to supplementary materials, which hinders the assessment of the proposed metrics.  
- The superiority of the proposed metrics over existing ones is not fully validated, and the generalizability of the empirical results is unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation and structure of the paper by clearly stating their goals and significance upfront, rather than diving into formal definitions. The introduction should incorporate related work to provide context. Additionally, we suggest moving relevant experimental details from the supplementary materials into the main text to enhance clarity. The authors should summarize the findings of their experiments more explicitly and ensure that claims made in the paper are supported by the presented results. Lastly, a thorough discussion of the overall findings and potential limitations of the proposed metrics should be included to provide a clearer understanding of their applicability.
