### Key Points
This paper presents an extension to the POMCP algorithm for online planning under partial observability, termed Information-Based POMCP (IB-POMCP). The distinguishing feature of IB-POMCP is its use of information entropy to enhance the tree search procedure, allowing it to better manage sparse rewards by focusing on branches likely to yield higher information gain. Key modifications include sampling new particles based on the likelihood of observations and introducing a recalculated exploration coefficient (I-UCB) that incorporates entropy, thereby promoting a more nuanced search compared to standard UCB1. The authors evaluate IB-POMCP against traditional POMCP and TB œÅ-POMCP in the RockSample, Tag, and LaserTag scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in reward collection and reasoning time in the Tag scenario, while showing comparable performance in the LaserTag scenario. They propose a dynamic threshold derived from ùëÉ(ùëß|‚Ñéùëüùëé), which enhances the particle filter's performance without requiring explicit true distributions or extensive calculations. The impact of the I-UCB equation on belief tracking is also discussed, suggesting that it may yield better threshold values than the UCB equation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper makes a clear original contribution to the literature on planning under partial observability, justifying the benefits of its information-guided approach intuitively. It provides strong experimental validation against relevant baselines and includes an ablation study that clarifies the contributions of individual algorithm components. The structure and clarity of the writing are commendable. IB-POMCP shows significant improvements in reward collection and reasoning time in the Tag scenario, and the use of a dynamic threshold enhances performance without needing explicit true distributions. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the I-UCB equation's potential advantages in belief tracking.

Weaknesses:  
Concerns exist regarding the incremental nature of the contributions, as the improvements over POMCP may be perceived as modest. The theoretical results section lacks sufficient context and intuition, which diminishes its impact. Specific technical aspects, such as the justification for Equation 2 and the clarity of terminology, require enhancement. Additionally, the results in the LaserTag scenario show no statistically significant differences among methods. Some claims in the discussion may be perceived as overstated, requiring careful phrasing to avoid overselling. The paper does not adequately address limitations, particularly regarding the scalability of the proposed algorithm beyond toy domains.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical results section by adding more intuition and discussion around those results rather than introducing new experimental domains. Clarifying the justification for Equation 2 and the terminology used in Line 128 would enhance understanding. The authors should also provide a clearer distinction between the planning phase and action execution, ensuring that it is evident that belief updates occur only after action execution. Furthermore, a more detailed explanation of the terms "information gain" and "exploration gain" in Lines 264-270 is necessary. We suggest including additional baselines, such as a model that utilizes a latent world model, to strengthen the experiments section and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of IB-POMCP's performance. Additionally, we recommend improving clarity regarding the comparison between the I-UCB and UCB equations, particularly in terms of their effects on ùëÉ(ùëß|‚Ñéùëüùëé). Finally, we encourage the authors to be cautious with language that may appear grandiose, ensuring that claims are appropriately tempered.
