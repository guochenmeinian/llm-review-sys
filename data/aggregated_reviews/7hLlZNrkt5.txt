Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of graph neural networks (GNNs) for link prediction in knowledge graphs, introducing conditional message-passing neural networks (C-MPNNs) that compute pairwise node representations. The authors analyze the expressive power of these networks using a relational Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm and provide a logical characterization. The paper includes experimental validation of theoretical findings, emphasizing the impact of various model design choices.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper systematically addresses the understanding of C-MPNNs for link prediction on knowledge graphs, contributing valuable theoretical insights.
2. It provides a solid overview of related work and situates its contributions within existing literature, fostering future research.
3. The experimental analysis validates theoretical claims and explores practical implications of different model choices.

Weaknesses:
1. The title and introduction overstate the scope of the paper, suggesting a broader theory of link prediction while primarily focusing on knowledge graphs. The clarity of certain sections, particularly lines 32-36, is lacking.
2. The claim regarding the design of a relational Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm may mislead readers into thinking it is a novel contribution, as similar discussions exist in prior work.
3. The logical characterization's significance is not clearly articulated, and the rationale for focusing solely on inductive link prediction is insufficiently justified.
4. The experimental comparisons do not adequately address existing works, particularly regarding the efficiency-expressivity trade-off, and additional datasets and baseline methods are needed for a more robust analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the title and introduction to accurately reflect the paper's focus on knowledge graphs. Additionally, we suggest providing a clearer distinction between the RGCN and CompGCN models with NBFNet. The authors should also clarify the relationship of their work to existing relational Weisfeiler-Leman algorithms and enhance the discussion on the motivation and significance of the logical characterization. Furthermore, we encourage the inclusion of more GNN baseline methods and datasets in the experiments to strengthen the findings and address the efficiency-expressivity trade-off more thoroughly.
