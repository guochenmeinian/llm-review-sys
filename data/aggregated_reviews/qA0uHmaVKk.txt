Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents theoretical results on the learning dynamics of real-valued and complex-valued neurons using gradient descent. Key findings include that complex-valued neurons can learn functions expressed by both real-valued and complex-valued neurons with convergence rates of \(O(t^{-3})\) and \(O(t^{-1})\), respectively. It is shown that a two-layer real-valued neural network cannot learn a single complex-valued neuron, and that complex-valued neurons learn more slowly than their real-valued counterparts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and accessible, even to non-experts.
- It provides significant theoretical advancements in the understanding of complex-valued neuron learning, contrasting it with real-valued neuron learning.
- The authors present rigorous proofs and a strong theoretical framework for analyzing learning dynamics.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical results lack empirical validation, which could strengthen the findings.
- The notation used is complex and may hinder understanding; clearer presentation or tables for key terms could enhance clarity.
- Certain assumptions made in the proofs may not hold in practical scenarios, and the implications of these assumptions are not fully explored.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including empirical experiments to validate the theoretical results and enhance readability. Additionally, clarifying the motivation for using a two-layer network to model a single neuron would strengthen the argument. We suggest providing clearer definitions for abbreviations and notations in the abstract and throughout the paper. Lastly, addressing the potential impact of the bias term on the analysis could provide deeper insights into the findings.
