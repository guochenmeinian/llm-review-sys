Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on PAC learning under covariate shift, focusing on two frameworks: PQ learning and TDS learning. PQ learning allows the learner to abstain from classifying some test samples while ensuring good accuracy on retained samples, whereas TDS learning permits complete abstention if the testing distribution is significantly different from the training distribution. The authors propose algorithms for both frameworks, achieving dimensionally-efficient learning under specific distributional assumptions (Gaussian or uniform) and simple concept classes. The main contributions include extending prior results to handle arbitrary fractions of outliers and providing tighter bounds.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers novel results in an area of significant interest, contributing to the understanding of distributional assumptions in algorithmic learning theory.
- The combination of spectral techniques for outlier removal with low-degree polynomial regression is insightful and effective.
- The writing is generally clear, making the key technical ideas accessible even to non-experts.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation is often unclear, particularly in the main text, which lacks sufficient technical detail and contains sloppy theorem statements.
- The results are limited to simple concept classes, and the restrictive distributional assumptions may hinder broader applicability.
- The proofs in the appendix are poorly written, with numerous inaccuracies and typos that complicate understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the main text by providing a more detailed overview of Theorem 3.1, ensuring that it conveys the logical flow without requiring extensive reference to the appendix. Additionally, we suggest that the authors refine the theorem statements for precision, defining all variables clearly and correcting any inaccuracies. To enhance the computational efficiency of their algorithms, we encourage the authors to explore whether the error parameter $\epsilon$ can be treated as a constant and potentially boosted. Lastly, we advise addressing the quality of the proofs in the appendix, ensuring consistent notation and clarity in the arguments presented.
