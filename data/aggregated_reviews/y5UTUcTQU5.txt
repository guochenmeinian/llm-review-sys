### Key Points
This paper presents a dual-channel span generation approach for aspect-level sentiment triplet extraction, utilizing two relational graph attention networks (RGAT) to learn high-order syntactic dependencies and linguistic features. The authors propose the Dual-Span method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in sentiment triplet extraction by effectively reducing the search space for span candidates. The paper also discusses the lexical characteristics of aspect and opinion terms, contributing valuable insights for future research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed Dual-Span method is novel and effectively reduces the search space of span candidates, enhancing performance.
- The approach demonstrates state-of-the-art results on two public datasets, showcasing its effectiveness.
- The paper is well-written, with clear presentation and thorough evaluation of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation is limited to only two public datasets, raising concerns about generalizability.
- There is a lack of comparison with non-span-based approaches, which could limit the evaluation's scope.
- The motivation behind the method is unclear, particularly regarding the definitions of "higher-order interaction" and "relevance" between spans.
- The related work section is incomplete, with repetitions and insufficient differentiation from prior work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind the proposed method, specifically by defining "higher-order interaction" and explaining how multiple dependencies transmit these interactions. Additionally, we suggest expanding the evaluation to include more diverse datasets and comparing the proposed method with non-span-based approaches. A detailed error analysis should be included to identify limitations and areas for improvement. Furthermore, please clarify the terms "Dual-GAT" and "Dual-RGAT," and ensure that all acronyms are introduced appropriately. Lastly, enhance the related work section to avoid repetition and clearly articulate the contributions of this work compared to prior studies.
