Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents FlipClass, a novel method for Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) that addresses key challenges in open-world scenarios, particularly the misalignment of attention between teacher and student models. The authors propose a dynamic attention alignment strategy that updates the teacher's focus based on the student's evolving attention, facilitating synchronized learning and enhancing performance across both old and new classes. The paper includes empirical and theoretical analyses, demonstrating that FlipClass significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with a strong motivation focused on largely ignored perspectives in GCD literature.
2. The innovative approach of dynamically aligning teacher and student attention is well-supported by comprehensive experimental results.
3. The authors provide useful empirical and theoretical insights, along with source code for reproduction.

Weaknesses:
1. The writing could be improved, particularly in the clarity of the section discussing "the Hopfield Network" and its motivation.
2. There is a lack of comparison with the SOTA method SPTNet, and the differences between distribution alignment and representation alignment need further discussion.
3. The ablation studies lack detailed explanations regarding the impact of hyperparameters and strong augmentations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the section on "the Hopfield Network" and its underlying motivation. Additionally, the authors should include a comparison with SPTNet and elaborate on the differences between distribution alignment and representation alignment to enhance reader understanding. We also suggest providing a more thorough analysis of the hyperparameter \(\alpha\) and its rationale, as well as clearer explanations in the ablation studies regarding strong augmentations and regularization techniques.
