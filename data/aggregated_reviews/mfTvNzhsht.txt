### Key Points
This paper presents a study of repeated cake cutting modeled as the unit interval $[0,1]$, where player $A$ (Alice) cuts the cake and player $B$ (Bob) chooses one of the two resulting pieces. The authors analyze both sequential and simultaneous settings, proving properties related to players' strategies and outcomes. They demonstrate that Alice can exploit Bob's myopic tendencies to achieve sublinear Stackelberg regret and devise strategies that lead to equitable outcomes for both players.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and theoretically sound, with an exhaustive literature review and clear definitions.  
- The results are novel, elegantly proven, and the setting is interesting and relevant to the community.  
- The sequential version of the problem is particularly insightful, revealing how Bob's greedy behavior can lead to suboptimal outcomes for himself while allowing for fairness enforcement.

Weaknesses:  
- The analysis is limited to dividing the interval $[0,1]$ into two parts, which may restrict applicability to more complex scenarios.  
- The paper contains an overwhelming number of results, leading to a superficial overview in the main body and relegating details to the appendix.  
- The related work section is excessively long, detracting from the main narrative.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generality of their analysis by considering valuations defined as countably additive rather than just finitely additive. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the definition of "fair" allocation, possibly by ensuring that $V_A(Z_A), V_B(Z_B) \ge 1/2$. To enhance the paper's structure, we advise condensing the related work section in the main body and moving the extended version to the appendix to allow for more space for preliminaries. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide real-world motivations for the repeated game setting to strengthen the paper's practical relevance.
