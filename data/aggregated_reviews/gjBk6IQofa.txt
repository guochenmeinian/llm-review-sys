Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for discovering skill hierarchies using hierarchical graph clustering, specifically employing the Louvain algorithm to reveal multi-level action abstractions. The authors claim that their approach allows for the automatic creation of skill hierarchies without predefining the number of levels. They argue that organizing the state-action space into a skill hierarchy is complex, and their method successfully addresses this challenge. The paper evaluates the method across six environments, demonstrating its potential to enhance learning efficiency in reinforcement learning tasks. The authors emphasize that existing graph-based methods typically yield single-level hierarchies, whereas their approach enables multi-level abstraction, which is crucial for effective learning. Empirical results indicate that agents using Louvain skills learn faster and more efficiently than those relying solely on primitive actions or existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of graph clustering for action hierarchy discovery is an interesting concept.
- The use of the Louvain Algorithm in a new context is a significant contribution, providing a novel method for creating multi-level action hierarchies.
- The paper provides detailed references, enhancing the understanding of the proposed method.
- Empirical results demonstrate that agents using Louvain skills learn faster and more efficiently than those relying solely on primitive actions or existing methods.
- Experiments across six different environments and an ablation study are commendable, showing robustness in environments with large state spaces.

Weaknesses:
- The writing quality is poor, with numerous grammatical errors that hinder comprehension.
- The technical description of the proposed approach is limited, leading to confusion.
- The reliance on a complete state transition graph may not be practical for real-world applications, and the method may not scale well to larger state spaces.
- The empirical evaluation lacks diversity, as many tasks are overly simplistic and do not reflect complex scenarios where skill hierarchies would be more beneficial.
- The proposed method may not be efficient, as combining lower actions into higher-level skills could be less effective than directly learning actions.
- Concerns were raised about the diversity of options and the potential limitations of the Louvain method in generating high-quality clustering results in certain scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and professionalism of the writing to enhance understanding. The technical details in the Proposed Approach section should be expanded to reduce confusion. Additionally, we suggest that the authors consider evaluating their method in more complex environments, such as StarCraft II or Minecraft, to demonstrate its efficacy in challenging scenarios. Addressing the limitations of relying on a complete state transition graph and providing a theoretical analysis of the learning efficiency would strengthen the paper. We also recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding the diversity of options generated by their approach and address concerns about the adaptability of these options in complex scenarios. Furthermore, providing more detailed evidence or reasoning to counter the claim that the multi-level skill hierarchy may be less efficient than direct action learning would be beneficial. Lastly, the authors should consider discussing the implications of potential failures in the Louvain method and how these might affect the overall performance of their approach.
