### Key Points
This paper presents a new benchmark for Arabic grammatical error correction (GEC) by investigating the effectiveness of grammatical error detection (GED) on GEC. The authors propose a novel alignment algorithm for error type annotation, achieving superior results compared to previous methods. They demonstrate that integrating GED and morphological disambiguation with the pre-trained model BART enhances GEC performance. The study utilizes three datasets (QALB-2014, QALB-2015, and ZAEBUC) and achieves state-of-the-art results on two of them. The paper is well-structured, making it accessible even to non-Arabic speakers.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to understand, providing clear insights into Arabic GEC.
- The proposed alignment algorithm and strong baseline contribute significantly to the Arabic GEC community.
- The experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets.

Weaknesses:
- There is a lack of explanations for certain results, particularly regarding the performance of AraT5 compared to AraBART.
- The impact of morphological analysis and error classification appears minimal, with many results not statistically significant.
- The accuracy of the automatic error type classification method is not adequately discussed, and a qualitative study is recommended.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanations of results, particularly in Section 7, to clarify discrepancies such as the performance of AraT5 versus AraBART. Additionally, please provide a more detailed description of the alignment algorithm, including whether the Levenshtein algorithm is applied to tokens or whole sentences. It would also be beneficial to include a qualitative analysis of the automatic error type classification to assess its accuracy against ground truth. Lastly, we suggest adding the structure of the paper in the introduction to enhance clarity.
