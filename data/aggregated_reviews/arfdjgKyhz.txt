### Key Points
This paper presents a study aimed at understanding how human gaze behavior can reveal differences between human and model performance in multiple object tracking (MOT). The authors justify the use of the MOT model as the most suitable for their research. The study shows promising results, with well-presented figures, but lacks clarity on whether bias was introduced in the training model. The authors propose that their model, built on Kalman Filtering and human vision, modifies existing slot-based MOT models to better replicate human tracking behavior, particularly in occlusion scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Rigorous adaptation of human vision to MOT.
- Evaluation against human data (N = 9) demonstrating the ability to replicate human behavior.
- Well-researched, well-written, and relevant to future machine vision tools.
- Detailed Appendix clarifying the research approach and fixation process.

Weaknesses:
- No formal related works section.
- Unclear motivation and application of replicating human behavior in this context.
- Lack of discussion on the implications of the no-noise model performing best and its relevance to other research domains.
- The modified model does not demonstrate a clear benefit over the unmodified model, particularly in occlusion scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind their approach and explicitly discuss the implications of their findings, particularly regarding the performance of the modified model compared to the unmodified model. Including a formal related works section is essential to contextualize their research within the broader field. Additionally, we suggest expanding the discussion on future work and the potential applications of accurately modeling human vision in various domains, such as perceptual optimizations and gaze prediction tasks. This would enhance the contribution level of the paper and clarify its significance for the research community.
