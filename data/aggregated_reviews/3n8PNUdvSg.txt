Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents RECESS, a proactive defense mechanism against untargeted model poisoning attacks in federated learning (FL). The authors propose a method that detects malicious clients through test gradients and robustly aggregates gradients using a trust scoring mechanism. The core insight is that malicious clients' update goals differ from those of benign clients, allowing for effective detection by comparing constructed gradients with client responses. The method is evaluated across four datasets and various FL settings, showing improved performance over existing defenses.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses significant limitations in current poisoning defenses, particularly their susceptibility to optimization-based attacks and inability to distinguish between malicious gradients and benign outliers.  
- The proposed method is theoretically and experimentally justified, with extensive evaluations and comparisons to five classic and two state-of-the-art defenses.  
- The writing is clear and the logic is easy to follow.

Weaknesses:  
- The defense's limited capacity is noted, as the observation regarding malicious clients primarily applies to untargeted model poisoning.  
- There is a lack of discussion on how malicious clients might comply with the designed test gradients, raising concerns about potential cheating.  
- Technical details require clarification, including the heuristic selection of elements for gradient adjustment, the simplicity of the evaluated models, and specifics regarding IID/Non-IID configurations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on compliance, addressing how malicious clients might circumvent the test gradient rules. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the technical details regarding the adjustment of gradients and providing more comprehensive information on the experimental setup, including client numbers and data distribution. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to evaluate their method against attacks involving fake clients and to compare their approach with existing detection methods, such as FLDetector, to enhance the robustness of their findings. Lastly, it would be beneficial to explicitly clarify the distinction between sending aggregated gradients and the standard FL process.
