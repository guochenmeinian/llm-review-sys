Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a diffusion-based framework for generating articulated objects as part graphs, introducing a two-stage strategy that first generates the structure with per-part conditions and then the part shapes. The authors propose a part latent encoding that accommodates multimodal conditions, including text and images. The work aims to enhance interpretability, controllability, and physical constraint adherence in 3D asset generation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The reparameterization of Plucker coordinates is more natural than prior work, improving constraint satisfaction.
- The node embedding with image and text features allows for detailed representation and flexible conditioned generation.
- The framework relaxes training constraints on canonical-posed shapes, enhancing data usability.

Weaknesses:
- Generating parts independently may seem unnatural, given the importance of inter-part relations in articulated objects.
- Quantitative improvements over prior work appear marginal.
- The claim of being "simulation-ready" is overreaching, as parts seem poorly connected and lack explicit physics enforcement.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their writing, particularly by introducing proper notations in sections 3.3 and 3.4. Additionally, we suggest including more qualitative results to demonstrate how varying image inputs affect the final output while keeping other attributes fixed. A side-by-side qualitative comparison with prior works like NAP and CAGE would strengthen the claims of improved geometry generation and natural joint motion. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the practicality of image control and provide evidence for the effectiveness of graph-based control in their framework.
