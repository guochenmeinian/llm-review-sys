### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of the downstream impact of LLM usage on gender bias in educational settings, specifically examining peer reviews written by different user groups with varying levels of LLM assistance. The authors analyze final written reviews for biased language and find no significant differences across user groups. They investigate potential sources of bias in model embeddings and suggestions, revealing gender bias in embeddings that does not translate to bias in suggestions. The study employs multiple gender bias metrics and evaluates various aspects of the NLP pipeline.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an important aspect of LLM usage in education, an emergent area of study.
- It is well-structured and clearly written.
- The methodology is comprehensive, utilizing multiple gender bias metrics and models.

Weaknesses:
- Concerns exist regarding the evaluation setup, particularly the variation in user demographics across groups, which may affect results.
- The study is limited to a single writing task, which restricts its contributions.
- The evaluation of bias could benefit from sentence-level metrics rather than word-level metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation setup by ensuring more homogeneity among user groups to mitigate demographic influences on results. Additionally, we suggest evaluating biases in studentsâ€™ reviews before and after LLM assistance to provide a clearer comparison. It would also be beneficial to include concrete examples of downstream gender bias resulting from LLM usage. Lastly, consider employing sentence-level bias metrics, such as SEAT, for a more nuanced analysis.
