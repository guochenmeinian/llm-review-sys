Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CaptainCook4D, a dataset aimed at studying errors in procedural activities, particularly in cooking. It comprises 384 recordings (94.5 hours) of individuals executing recipes in real kitchen environments, capturing both intentional and unintentional deviations. The authors benchmark the dataset for three tasks: error recognition, multi-step localization, and procedure learning. The dataset includes a comprehensive taxonomy of errors and detailed annotations, facilitating research in these areas.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The dataset's focus on errors in cooking activities is a valuable contribution to the field.
2. It provides comprehensive annotations for steps and actions, along with error descriptions.
3. The benchmarking of the dataset includes up-to-date baselines across various modalities, enhancing its utility for error recognition.

Weaknesses:
1. The dataset is limited to 8 participants and 10 kitchens, which may not adequately represent diverse real-world scenarios.
2. The related work section lacks a thorough discussion of scientific progress in error recognition, temporal action localization, and procedure learning.
3. The procedure learning experiment appears too simplistic to sufficiently address the posed research questions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section by providing a brief literature review on error recognition, temporal action localization, and procedure learning. Additionally, defining fine-grained and coarse-grained actions will enhance the consistency of annotations. The authors should consider benchmarking more procedure learning methods and include a discussion on the real-world applications of each benchmarked task. Expanding the dataset by incorporating a broader diversity of participants and kitchens, as well as annotating existing goal-oriented egocentric video data from datasets like Ego-Exo4D and EgoExoLearn, could also enhance its applicability.
