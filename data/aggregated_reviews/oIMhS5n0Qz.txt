### Key Points
This paper presents a study on generating alternatives to PFAS to mitigate its toxic nature, introducing a comprehensive framework called MatGFN. This framework utilizes GflowNet and MoLFormer to generate PFAS molecules and predict their toxicity accurately.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper offers a significant contribution through the MatGFN framework, which combines advanced methodologies for PFAS alternative generation.

Weaknesses:  
- The experimental analysis lacks rigor, demonstrating only one FPAF alternative generation.  
- Certain sections, particularly the results, require refinement; Table 1 lacks contextual descriptions, and Figure 2 has duplicate titles.  
- There are inconsistencies in the reported LD50 values, raising concerns about data accuracy and reliability.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental setup to demonstrate the feasibility of the framework more rigorously. Additionally, providing a concise summary of the performance of all query SMILES in the main body of the text would enhance reader comprehension. Lastly, addressing the clarity of Table 1 and the discrepancies in LD50 values will strengthen the manuscript's overall robustness.
