Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of Gaussian processes on Riemannian manifolds, focusing on the contraction rates of Matern Gaussian processes in both intrinsic and extrinsic settings. The authors prove that the optimal contraction rate is $\frac{2 \min(\beta, \nu)}{2 \nu + d}$, where $\nu$ is the smoothness parameter, $\beta$ is the regression function smoothness class, and $d$ is the dimension. They also demonstrate through empirical analysis that geometric models outperform non-geometric ones, particularly in small sample scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is extremely well-written, with clear exposition.
- It presents novel theoretical results and interesting findings, particularly regarding the influence of manifold dimension in extrinsic cases.
- The empirical study effectively addresses small sample scenarios.

Weaknesses:
- Theorems are not included in the main text, suggesting that a longer format than NeurIPS may be more suitable for presentation.
- The analysis assumes the "nugget" $\sigma_\epsilon$ is known, which may limit applicability in Bayesian contexts.
- The focus on synthetic examples in numerical experiments raises questions about performance on real data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation by including the theorems in the main paper or considering a longer format. Additionally, it would be beneficial to explore the implications of placing a prior on the nugget $\sigma_\epsilon$ in Bayesian settings. The authors should also investigate extrapolation errors and consider including real data examples in their numerical experiments. Clarifying the notation for the H\"older class and addressing the assumptions regarding the smoothness parameters $\nu$ and $\beta$ would enhance the paper's rigor. Finally, we suggest discussing the computational aspects of eigenfunction calculations for arbitrary manifolds and providing insights into the constants in the theorems.
