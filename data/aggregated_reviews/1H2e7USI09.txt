Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into flow matching-based generative models for high-resolution image synthesis, particularly as priors for solving inverse problems. The authors propose an efficient iterative algorithm for approximating the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimator, addressing the challenge of slow log-likelihood computations in high-dimensional contexts. The method involves approximating the MAP objective through a series of "local MAP" objectives and utilizes Tweedie's formula for gradient optimization. The performance of the proposed method is validated across various inverse problems and datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a unique method for solving inverse problems and reconstructing images, supported by a solid theoretical foundation.
- The approach is effective across diverse linear inverse problems, demonstrating originality and a good understanding of flow matching.
- The presentation is generally clear, with informative discussions on the feasibility of assumptions and hyperparameter effects.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks sufficient empirical evidence and qualitative results to conclusively demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.
- Additional metrics, such as FID and LPIPS scores, should be included alongside PSNR and SSIM for a comprehensive assessment.
- The presentation of quantitative results could be improved by using tables for easier interpretation.
- The algorithm's testing is limited to the CelebA-HQ dataset, with a need for inclusion of pretrained models for other datasets.
- The reconstructed images are noted to be too smooth and lack high-frequency details, resulting in blurry outputs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical validation by providing more comprehensive testing across various datasets and including additional qualitative results. The inclusion of metrics like FID and LPIPS alongside PSNR and SSIM is essential for a more thorough performance assessment. We also suggest presenting quantitative results in table format for better clarity. Additionally, the authors should consider testing their algorithm on smaller sampling rates in compressed sensing experiments and provide comparisons with classical recovery algorithms. Finally, addressing the blurriness in reconstruction results and ensuring a broader comparison with other generative models will strengthen the paper's contributions.
