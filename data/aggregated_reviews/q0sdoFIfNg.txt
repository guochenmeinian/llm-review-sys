Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Spiked Wishart Q-ensemble independence regularization (SPQR) to enhance the independence of Q-network ensembles in reinforcement learning (RL). The authors utilize random matrix theory to derive a KL divergence loss that penalizes the difference between the empirical spectral density of eigenvalues and Wignerâ€™s semicircle distribution. The proposed method is validated through extensive experiments on online and offline RL tasks, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing ensemble methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-organized and clearly written.
2. SPQR shows promising improvements over ensemble RL methods like SAC-ens and REDQ.
3. The authors provide a theoretical foundation for the SPQR loss, ensuring the independence of the Q-networks.
4. Comprehensive experiments validate the general applicability of SPQR across various RL tasks.

Weaknesses:
1. The connection between the mathematical tools used and the proposed method is inadequately explained, particularly regarding the spiked random model.
2. Algorithm 1 lacks details on constructing the symmetric Q-matrix, with essential information relegated to the appendix.
3. The quality of figures is subpar, with text sizes being too small for readability.
4. Numerous typographical errors are present throughout the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanations connecting the mathematical tools to the proposed method, particularly clarifying the purpose of the spiked random model in SPQR. Additionally, please provide more details on constructing the symmetric Q-matrix in Algorithm 1. We suggest enhancing the quality of figures by increasing text sizes for better readability. Lastly, we encourage the authors to address the typographical errors identified in the review.
