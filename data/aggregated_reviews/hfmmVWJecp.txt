### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of non-compositionality in sentiment phrases, focusing on how sentiment analysis systems manage phrases whose sentiment diverges from expectations. The authors create a dataset of 259 phrases, derived from a sample of 500 phrases from the SST dataset, through syntactic replacements and human annotations. The findings indicate that while most phrases conform to compositionality, exceptions arise from figures of speech, common sense reasoning, and discourse relations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The generated resources are valuable for further exploration of non-compositionality in sentiment analysis.
- The work is original and moves beyond mere benchmark improvements.
- The paper is well-written and presents a clear methodology with good inter-annotator agreement.

Weaknesses:
- Some methodological limitations are acknowledged but may detract from the overall value.
- Details regarding the relationship between sentiment composition types and non-compositionality are insufficient.
- The evaluation metrics are limited to F1 and Pearson's R, lacking additional metrics like MAE and MES.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how "sentiment composition" types relate to non-compositionality, particularly in Figure 3, by providing additional details such as the number of examples per group and significance testing results. Additionally, we suggest including a summary of the paper's conclusions to clarify the findings. It would also be beneficial to expand the evaluation metrics to include MAE and MES for a more comprehensive analysis. Lastly, we encourage the authors to address the methodological concerns raised and provide further details on the dataset's construction and the selection of training examples.
