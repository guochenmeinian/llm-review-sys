Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a manifold-constrained multi-hypothesis model for 3D human pose lifting, termed ManiPose. The authors propose a framework that predicts skeletal parameters to ensure that the estimated 3D poses remain on a smooth manifold, addressing the inconsistency of joint positions that arises from traditional regression methods. The theoretical analysis highlights the limitations of single-hypothesis approaches and demonstrates the advantages of multi-hypothesis methods. The empirical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides valuable theoretical analysis and intuitive toy examples that illustrate the ambiguity in pose lifting.
- The proposed framework effectively maintains pose consistency while achieving state-of-the-art performance in MPJPE metrics.
- The evaluation results, particularly the newly proposed consistency metric, are impressive and clearly demonstrate the superiority of the method.

Weaknesses:
- The concept of enforcing body priors, such as constant bone lengths, is not novel and has been explored in existing works like SMPL, which should be acknowledged.
- The choice to overparameterize poses using relative 3D bone orientations rather than 3D segment directions lacks sufficient motivation and discussion.
- The paper does not clarify which aggregation method is used for MPI-INF-3DHP and primarily reports oracle results, limiting the assessment of temporal consistency in predictions.
- The multi-head design for hypothesis prediction restricts flexibility and diversity, and the trade-off between accuracy and consistency is not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the novelty of their approach by referencing existing works like SMPL and addressing how their method differs. Additionally, the authors should provide a clearer motivation for the choice of pose parameterization and include an ablation study to support this decision. It would be beneficial to evaluate the temporal consistency of predictions through qualitative video examples and quantitative metrics, such as joint acceleration. Furthermore, the authors should consider providing numerical or visual measurements of hypothesis diversity and clarify the aggregation method used for MPI-INF-3DHP. Lastly, we suggest including additional metrics related to diversity in the paper and avoiding the use of "Oracle MPJPE" as a proxy for measuring diversity.
