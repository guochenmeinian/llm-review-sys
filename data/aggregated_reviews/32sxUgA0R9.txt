### Key Points
This paper presents the 'partitioned b-bit hashing' (Pb-Hash) method aimed at improving the efficiency of hashing in large-scale machine learning applications. The authors provide a thorough theoretical analysis and demonstrate the application of Pb-Hash to Minwise Hashing for binary data and Consistent Weighted Sampling for general non-negative data. The methodology is well-motivated, showing that while using ùëö chunks of ùêµ/ùëö bits may reduce accuracy compared to using ùêµ bits directly, the accuracy remains viable for certain cases. The paper fits well within the ICTIR conference scope, offering sound theoretical analysis and empirical validation for linear SVM and deep learning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- Clear identification of challenges in hash reuse and a well-defined solution with Pb-Hash.  
- Thorough theoretical framework and empirical validation across various datasets.  
- Original contribution through the partitioning of hash codes, enhancing neural network efficiency.  

Weaknesses:  
- Lack of specific examples demonstrating Pb-Hash's application in Information Retrieval, limiting its relevance to the field.  
- Some concepts and notations require clearer definitions, and further elaboration on dataset selection is needed.  
- Inconsistencies in axis ranges in plots could hinder interpretation, and the abstract may not fully convey the nuances of the methodology.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by explicitly linking the findings of Pb-Hash to potential applications in Information Retrieval, which would enhance its appeal to the ICTIR community. Additionally, providing clearer definitions for certain concepts and notations before their usage would improve comprehension. Further elaboration on the rationale behind dataset selection and ensuring consistent axis ranges in figures would aid in the interpretation of results. Addressing potential limitations, such as the influence of data type on Pb-Hash performance, could strengthen the paper's argument.
