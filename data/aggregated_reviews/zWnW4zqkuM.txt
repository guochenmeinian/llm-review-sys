Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an approach to enhance image synthesis using multimodal attributed graphs (MMAGs) through a graph context-conditioned diffusion model, INSTRUCTG2I. The authors propose a semantic personalized PageRank-based method for neighbor sampling, enabling effective encoding of graph conditional information as prompts. Systematic experiments demonstrate the model's effectiveness compared to competitive baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a meaningful question by exploring graph-structured relationships for image generation, grounded in practical applications.
- The structure of the paper is clear and easy to follow.
- The proposed graph context-conditioned diffusion model is a reasonable solution for image generation challenges.

Weaknesses:
- The introduction of graph conditioning mechanisms appears incremental, with many design choices inadequately discussed and lacking quantitative results.
- Certain equations, such as eq.10, may contain inaccuracies, and the descriptions in subsection 3.4 are not exhaustive.
- The ablation experiments suggest that using GNNs like GAT or GraphSAGE may not outperform simpler approaches, necessitating further discussion.
- Concerns arise regarding potential label leakage in the images sampled via semantic PPR-based sampling.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation in lines 28-30, as the reliance on graph structure for virtual artwork creation could be better justified. Additionally, please reference recent work on multimodal graph learning to position your contributions more effectively. We suggest adopting conventional notation for graph elements to enhance clarity and consider including a symbol table to aid understanding. It would be beneficial to explore learnable importance for neighbor selection and provide a quantitative analysis of the PPR neighbor-based sampling approach. Lastly, we encourage the authors to discuss the techniques used to incorporate graph conditions in baseline models and to clarify scenarios where graph input significantly enhances performance compared to standard models.
