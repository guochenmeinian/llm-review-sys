Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ID-GEN, a novel algorithm that integrates conditional generative models with causal inference to perform high-dimensional interventional sampling. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of ID-GEN on diverse datasets, including Colored MNIST, CelebA, and MIMIC-CXR. The method builds on the ID algorithm, providing theoretical guarantees for identifiable quantities while addressing hidden confounders.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of ID-GEN creatively combines diffusion models with causal inference, addressing high-dimensional interventional sampling.
- The theoretical framework is solid, ensuring that identifiable quantities are accurately estimated.
- Extensive experiments validate the performance of ID-GEN across various applications.

Weaknesses:
- The paper is difficult to read, with essential graphical elements relegated to supplements, complicating understanding, particularly in Example 4.1.
- The novelty of the method is unclear; it appears to be an implementation of the ID algorithm using diffusion models rather than a fundamentally new approach.
- The implications of the algorithm are not sufficiently discussed, particularly regarding potential extensions to symbolic calculus or automatic causal inference with images.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by integrating key graphical elements into the main text to enhance comprehension. Additionally, the authors should clarify whether ID-GEN introduces new recursive methodologies or is primarily an implementation of the existing ID algorithm. A more detailed discussion on the potential extensions of the algorithm to symbolic calculus and the challenges of automatic causal inference with high-dimensional data would also strengthen the manuscript. Furthermore, we suggest simplifying the notation and providing clearer explanations of complex steps in the algorithm to aid reader understanding.
