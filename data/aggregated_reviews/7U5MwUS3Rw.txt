Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents VFair, a novel method aimed at achieving Rawlsian fairness without requiring demographic information. The approach minimizes the variance of losses while maintaining overall utility, addressing significant issues in algorithmic fairness. The authors propose a dynamic weighting scheme for multi-objective optimization, leveraging the relationship between sample mean and variance. The empirical results suggest that VFair outperforms existing methods that do not consider demographic data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is easy to read and addresses a highly relevant topic in algorithmic fairness.
2. The proposed method effectively combines mean loss minimization with variance reduction, presenting a straightforward yet innovative approach.
3. The authors provide empirical evidence supporting their claims and a thorough analysis of their methodology.

Weaknesses:
1. The experimental results lack comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, limiting the evaluation of VFair's effectiveness.
2. The motivation for the proposed method is insufficiently highlighted, leaving unclear how it uniquely addresses limitations of previous approaches.
3. Reproducibility issues arise from inadequate details regarding experimental settings, such as learning rates and dataset splits.
4. The connection between the proposed fairness criteria and existing literature on individual fairness is not adequately discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind VFair, explicitly articulating its unique contributions compared to previous methods. Additionally, including comparisons with more recent and relevant state-of-the-art methods would enhance the evaluation of VFair's performance. To address reproducibility concerns, the authors should provide detailed information on experimental settings, including hyperparameters and dataset handling. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors clarify the relationship between their approach and existing works on individual fairness, potentially incorporating relevant references and comparisons in the experimental section.
