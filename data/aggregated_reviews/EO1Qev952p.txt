Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the socially-fair low-rank approximation and column subset selection problems, aiming to optimize performance across sub-populations defined by $\ell$ matrices. The authors propose a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm with a running time of \(O(2^n)\) and a polynomial-time algorithm for column selection with an approximation ratio of \(\tilde{O}(k)\). They establish that achieving constant approximation requires exponential time under the ETH conjecture and provide experimental results to support their theoretical findings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The problem is well-motivated and relevant to the machine learning community, particularly in feature selection.
2. The paper is technically solid, with a clear high-level algorithmic approach that iteratively improves from a "bad" solution.
3. The writing is generally clear, with helpful intuitions and descriptions provided in Section 1.1.

Weaknesses:
1. The $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm's exponential time complexity limits its practical applications, while the polynomial-time column selection algorithm has a linear approximation ratio in \(k\).
2. The introduction is dense and could benefit from clearer organization, as it contains significant overlap with later sections.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction by reducing overlap with later sections and presenting details more succinctly. Additionally, consider exploring parallel algorithms to enhance the practical applicability of the proposed methods. Addressing the notation inconsistencies and ensuring definitions are clear and accessible throughout the paper will also help in making the work more comprehensible to a broader audience.
