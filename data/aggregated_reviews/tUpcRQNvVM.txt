Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Deep Submodular Peripteral Networks (DSPNs), a novel parametric family of submodular functions aimed at enhancing practical learning methods for submodular functions and graded pairwise comparisons (GPC). The authors propose a new GPC-style loss function, termed peripteral loss, which utilizes numerically graded relationships between pairs of objects, thereby extracting more nuanced information than traditional binary comparisons. The efficacy of DSPNs is demonstrated through experiments, particularly in learning a facility location function.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of DSPNs is original, providing a scalable approach to learning submodular functions.
- The peripteral loss function is well-conceived and has potential applications, such as in learning reward models in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).
- The paper is generally well-written and presents thorough experimental comparisons with baseline methods.

Weaknesses:
- The organization of the paper requires improvement; key concepts like submodular functions and GPCs lack definitions upon their first mention, which may hinder reader comprehension.
- The theoretical guarantees for the peripteral loss are not addressed, raising concerns about its applicability if the target oracle does not exist.
- Some figures and important content are relegated to the appendix, which could detract from the paper's standalone quality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization of the paper by providing informal definitions or references for key concepts like graded pairwise preferences and submodular functions upon their first appearance. Additionally, we suggest adding motivation and detailed applications of submodular functions in machine learning within the introduction to clarify their significance. It would also be beneficial to explicitly state the task related to the target facility location function in the main text. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore the theoretical implications of the peripteral loss, particularly regarding scenarios where the target oracle may not exist.
