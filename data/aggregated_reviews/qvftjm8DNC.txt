### Key Points
This paper presents the PEACE-Reviews dataset, a novel collection of autobiographical writing reviews annotated with first-person emotional variables, aimed at measuring emotional states and cognitive appraisal dimensions in product and service reviews. The dataset addresses limitations in existing datasets, which primarily reflect third-person perspectives and lack comprehensive emotional annotations. The authors conducted baseline experiments to predict emotions and cognitive appraisals using linguistic features, demonstrating the dataset's potential for further research in understanding the psychological connections between self-cognitive appraisals and emotions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is the first of its kind to provide first-person emotional and cognitive appraisal annotations, filling a significant gap in the literature.
- The data collection process is well-documented, including a pilot study to optimize writing prompts, enhancing the quality of the dataset.
- The authors provide a thorough literature review, contextualizing the theoretical framework of cognitive appraisal.

Weaknesses:
- The rationale for selecting specific appraisal dimensions and the ambiguity surrounding the classification process need further clarification.
- The analysis of linguistic features is limited and could benefit from a more extensive examination of word and n-gram occurrences.
- The writing quality requires improvement, with several grammatical errors and unclear sections noted by reviewers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the dataset's relevance by discussing additional use cases beyond targeted advertising. It is essential to address the ethical implications of emotion classification more thoroughly, including guidance on the appropriate use of the dataset to prevent misinterpretations. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the clarity of the classification process for appraisal dimensions and expanding the analysis of linguistic features to include results on word occurrences and topic modeling. Finally, we encourage the authors to refine the writing for clarity and coherence, addressing the noted grammatical issues and ambiguities throughout the paper.
