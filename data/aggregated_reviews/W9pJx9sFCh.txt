Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a poison backdoor attack for visual object tracking (VOT), requiring only a preset backdoor trigger to poison a small number of training samples, leading to incorrect predictions on those samples. The authors evaluate various trackers across multiple benchmarks, adapting concepts from BadNets to VOT. The main contributions include demonstrating the feasibility of poison-only backdoor attacks and proposing a clean-label backdoor attack method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is clearly written and structured, making it easy to follow.  
- It addresses an important topic regarding the contamination of open-source datasets and its implications for VOT.  
- The experimental results are strong, validating the effectiveness of the proposed attack on state-of-the-art VOT models.  

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty and contribution are somewhat limited, as the approach heavily borrows from existing methods like BadNets and does not sufficiently differentiate from similar works, such as TAT.  
- There is a lack of in-depth discussion on why certain trackers, like DiMP, are invulnerable to the proposed attack, which could provide valuable guidelines for designing robust architectures.  
- More experiments on different trackers and a broader discussion on the implications of poisoning open-source data are needed to enhance the generalizability of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the differences between their proposed algorithm and existing backdoor attack methods, particularly TAT. Additionally, the authors should provide a more thorough analysis of why certain trackers are invulnerable and include guidelines for designing robust architectures. We also suggest incorporating a more extensive discussion on the broader impacts of their work within the main paper, rather than relegating it to supplementary material. Finally, more experiments on various trackers, including SiamCAR and TCTrack, should be conducted to validate the generalization of the backdoor attack method.
