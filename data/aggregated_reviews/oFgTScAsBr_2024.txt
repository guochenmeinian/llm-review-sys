Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel zero-shot image denoising method named Masked Pre-train then Iterative fill (MPI). The authors propose a two-step approach: first, pre-training a model on a large dataset of natural images using a masking strategy to learn generalized image distributions; second, fine-tuning this model on a specific noisy image for denoising. The authors validate the effectiveness of their method across various noise types and datasets, claiming superior performance compared to existing zero-shot methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel and sound idea with clear benefits, particularly in generalization performance for unseen noise types.
- The technical details and experimental evaluations are of high quality, demonstrating significant improvements over prior zero-shot methods.
- The writing is clear and the structure allows for easy understanding of the method and results.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the method is limited, as it shares similarities with existing approaches like MetaDIP and DGP. The comparison with these methods lacks depth, particularly regarding the application of "average smoothing" to DIP's outputs.
- The discussion on the masking ratio is insufficient; understanding its impact on different noise types is crucial. A random masking ratio within a certain range (e.g., $p\in[0.3, 0.6]$) could enhance effectiveness.
- The presentation of the core method is problematic, lacking clarity in explaining what the model learns from pre-training and how it applies to zero-shot denoising.
- The choice of focusing solely on denoising is questionable; the method may be applicable to other image restoration tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparative analysis by including a broader range of zero-shot techniques, particularly recent advances, to better contextualize MPI's performance. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the theoretical underpinnings of their method, particularly regarding the masking ratio and its implications for different noise types. It would also be beneficial to explore the potential of combining mask prediction and iterative filling to leverage statistical properties of noise for enhanced denoising. Finally, we encourage the authors to consider discussing the applicability of their method beyond denoising to other image restoration tasks.
