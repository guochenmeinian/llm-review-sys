Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for open compound domain adaptation (OCDA) in semantic segmentation, focusing on compensating for object style discrepancies between source and target domains. The authors propose an Object-Level Discrepancy Memory (OLDM) that stores various discrepancy features to align object styles, thereby improving the accuracy of pseudo labels for self-training. The method is evaluated across multiple datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The writing is well-organized and easy to follow.
- The approach to OCDA from a category-level style compensation perspective is novel and insightful.
- Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies support the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- The terminology "Instance-Key" may not be suitable for semantic segmentation tasks lacking instance-level annotations.
- The paper lacks clarity on several implementation details, such as the definition of the open compound domain adaptive semantic segmentation task and the role of the intermediate segmentation head.
- The method involves numerous hyper-parameters, and their impact on performance is not sufficiently analyzed.
- Missing necessary ablations and explanations regarding the scalability of the method to large datasets and the generalization to unseen domains.
- The related work section is poorly organized, lacking recent references and a coherent flow.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the terminology used, particularly regarding "Instance-Key." Additionally, merging content in Table 7 or relocating some sub-tables to supplementary material could enhance readability. The authors should provide a formal definition of the open compound domain adaptive semantic segmentation task and clarify the role of the intermediate segmentation head. We suggest conducting empirical studies to analyze the effects of hyper-parameters on performance and including necessary ablations to explore alternative formulations in the equations presented. Furthermore, the authors should refine the related work section to include recent literature and improve its organization. Lastly, addressing the scalability of the method and providing explanations for its generalization capabilities to unseen domains would strengthen the paper.
