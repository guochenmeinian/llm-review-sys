Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a self-supervised approach for learning view-invariant action features by aligning egocentric and exocentric videos temporally. The authors propose two main components: an object-centric encoder that focuses on hands and active objects, and a contrastive learning paradigm that aligns videos from different viewpoints. The paper also establishes a new benchmark for evaluating the method, supported by extensive experiments across four downstream tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-motivated and clearly written, addressing an important area in video understanding.
- It introduces a novel framework capable of utilizing unpaired data from different environments.
- Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and ablation studies evaluate each design choice.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the proposed method is limited, as it combines existing modules without significant innovation.
- The benchmark datasets have a limited number of samples and diversity, raising concerns about generalizability.
- The proposed negative sampling strategy using reversed frames lacks experimental validation against random shuffling.
- There is insufficient analysis of experimental results, particularly in the ablation experiments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their approach by exploring more innovative combinations of existing techniques. Additionally, please provide more details on the benchmark datasets, including the number of action classes and the rationale behind the limited sample sizes. We suggest conducting further experiments to compare the effectiveness of reversed frames versus random shuffling in negative sampling. Lastly, enhance the analysis of experimental results in the ablation section and clarify implementation details regarding the initialization and training of the object-centric encoder.
