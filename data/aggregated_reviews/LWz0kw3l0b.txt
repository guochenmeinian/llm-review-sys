### Key Points
This paper presents an entity-aware summarization framework designed to enhance the reliability of AI-generated summaries in sponsored search contexts. The authors propose a structured, three-step process that includes webpage entity tagging, query reflection, and entity-aware summary generation, while fine-tuning the LLaMa3.1-8B model with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to optimize query-document relevance. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in F1 scores for entity recognition and recall in retrieval tasks, indicating the framework's effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses the critical issue of misalignment between AI-generated summaries and actual webpage content, providing a well-motivated and practically relevant solution.  
- Robust experimental setup with extensive evaluations across multiple tasks, showing improvements in F1 scores and retrieval metrics like recall and nDCG.  
- Detailed explanations of key concepts, including entity-aware summarization and the role of DPO, enhance understanding.  
- The framework has significant real-world implications for improving the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated summaries in sponsored search.

Weaknesses:  
- The complexity of the multi-step pipeline may pose challenges for practical deployment at scale.  
- The focus on sponsored search limits the exploration of the framework's applicability to other information retrieval tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the scalability of DPO with complex queries and consider testing the framework on more diverse datasets to confirm its robustness and applicability in varied real-world scenarios. Additionally, addressing potential biases in AI-generated content would strengthen the framework's reliability.
