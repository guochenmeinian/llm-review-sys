Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents MuDI, a novel framework aimed at enhancing multi-subject personalization in text-to-image diffusion models. It effectively decouples identities of multiple subjects by utilizing segmented subjects from a foundation model for data augmentation and generation initialization. The authors introduce a new metric to evaluate multi-subject personalization, and experimental results indicate that MuDI generates high-quality personalized images without identity mixing, outperforming existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- Experimental results are comprehensive and support the claims made.
- MuDI successfully prevents identity mixing, maintaining clear individual identities.
- The introduction of a new metric enhances the assessment of multi-subject personalization performance.
- The design of the evaluation benchmark is convincing for evaluating disentanglement.

Weaknesses:
- MuDI requires test-time fine-tuning for each set of concepts, which may limit practical application compared to tuning-free approaches like IP-Adapter.
- The dataset is small and lacks diversity, which does not adequately demonstrate the method's superiority.
- Some methods and designs, such as the use of descriptive classes and data-augmentation pipelines, have been previously verified, limiting the novelty of the approach.
- The qualitative comparison lacks comprehensiveness, and the paper does not sufficiently discuss the limitations of MuDI, such as its performance on highly similar subjects or complex scenes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset by providing a more detailed description, including its size and diversity, to enhance reproducibility. Additionally, conducting more experiments to clarify the dataset's limitations would be beneficial. We suggest including comparisons with existing metrics to validate the model's performance further. The authors should also consider a more comprehensive evaluation against a wider range of baselines, including recent advancements like PortraitBooth and FastComposer. Finally, a thorough discussion of the potential limitations of MuDI, particularly regarding its sensitivity to image complexity and the impact of Seg-Mix on size biases, would strengthen the paper's contribution.
