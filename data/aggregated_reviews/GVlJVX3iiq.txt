Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method called Federated Multi-View Clustering via Synergistic Contrast (FMCSC) to address heterogeneous hybrid views in federated multi-view clustering (FedMVC). The authors propose strategies that bridge client and view gaps through theoretical and experimental analyses, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach across various datasets. The method incorporates locally collaborative contrastive learning and global-specific aggregation to enhance clustering structures among clients.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The scenario of heterogeneous hybrid views is compelling and relevant to real-world applications.
2. The paper is well-organized, with thorough appendices that include theoretical proofs and extensive experiments.
3. The proposed global weighted aggregation method shows innovation by encouraging the global model to learn complementary features from mixed views.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the synergistic contrast strategy is questionable, given the prevalence of contrastive learning in multi-view clustering.
2. The paper lacks clarity on the data partitioning strategy and does not analyze the communication overhead associated with model parameter transfers.
3. The dataset size of 10,000 is insufficient for validating the proposed methods, and the computational complexity of the global-specific weighting aggregation may limit its applicability to large-scale tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of why the approach for extracting common semantics H is suitable for clustering tasks. Additionally, the authors should provide details on the data distribution among clients and clarify the purpose of observations presented in Section 3.2. To enhance robustness, we suggest using a larger dataset for validation and addressing the computational complexity of the global-specific weighting aggregation to ensure scalability.
