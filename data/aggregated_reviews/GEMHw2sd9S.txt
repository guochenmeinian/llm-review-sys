Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a series of differentially private (DP) Random Projection (RP) algorithms, including Signed Random Projection (SRP), aimed at enhancing privacy in matrix data operations. The authors demonstrate that their algorithms outperform previous methods by utilizing techniques such as smooth sensitivity and improved upper bounds on sensitivity. The empirical results indicate significant improvements in accuracy for applications like dimensionality reduction and similarity estimation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The analysis of smooth sign flipping probability offers a novel perspective for DP RP algorithms.
- The paper addresses an important problem in privacy-preserving data analysis with theoretically sound and non-trivial results.
- The experimental evaluation effectively highlights the improvements achieved by the proposed algorithms.

Weaknesses:
- The utility guarantee for the smooth flipping probability algorithms is unclear, which weakens the main focus of the paper.
- The novelty of some algorithms, particularly DP-RP-G-OPT and DP-OPORP, is questionable as they do not provide significant asymptotic improvements over prior work.
- The privacy model lacks clarity, particularly regarding the input of single data points versus adjacent datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the privacy model, explicitly addressing how it applies to the CountSketch application. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a utility guarantee for the smooth flipping probability algorithms to strengthen their results. It would also be beneficial to include comparisons with methods that keep the projection matrix secret, as this could provide valuable insights into the potential headroom for improvement. Finally, we encourage the authors to enhance the writing quality, particularly by introducing the concept of "smooth flipping probability" earlier in the paper to better highlight its significance.
