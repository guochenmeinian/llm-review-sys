Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents TempME, an explanation methodology for temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) that incorporates temporal motifs to enhance explainability and cohesiveness. The authors propose a pipeline consisting of sampling, embedding, and explaining, which allows for the extraction of meaningful sub-graph structures that influence predictions. The integration of temporal motifs is claimed to lead to three main enhancements: improved accuracy and fidelity of explanations, the generation of human-intelligible explanations characterized by cohesiveness, and enhanced link prediction performance due to effective motif encoding. TempME demonstrates improved performance across various datasets, achieving better accuracy in link prediction tasks compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work introduces a novel approach to TGNN explainability by utilizing temporal motifs.
- The methodology is well-supported by solid technical material and extensive experimental results.
- TempME shows significant improvements in explanation accuracy and model performance, with a clear organization and presentation.
- The incorporation of temporal motifs significantly improves explanation accuracy and fidelity, supported by empirical evidence in the results.
- The explanations generated exhibit a cohesive property, providing a comprehensive view of motif importance.
- The approach positively influences link prediction performance across various TGNN architectures.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity in the evaluation goals and settings, particularly regarding the explanation performance metrics.
- The assumption that network motifs consist of temporally proximate nodes and edges may not hold due to seasonal effects in network time series.
- There are several unclear definitions and missing explanations in the methodology, particularly regarding mutual information and the nature of the motifs.
- The novelty of the approach is questioned, as it overlaps with existing research on sub-graph structures for TGNN explainability.
- Some reviewers express reservations regarding the overall impact of the paper, leading to a lower acceptance rating despite acknowledging the explanations provided.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the evaluation goals and settings, specifically by providing intuitive explanations for metrics like "ACC-AUC" and defining "sparsity" more clearly in Section 3. Additionally, the authors should address the assumptions regarding temporal motifs and explore the potential impact of seasonal effects on their methodology. We suggest including a worked example that relates the explanation to a tangible real-world scenario to enhance understanding. Furthermore, the authors should compare their approach with more recent state-of-the-art static graph explainers and clarify the terminology around "generative models" to avoid confusion. We also encourage the authors to strengthen the discussion on limitations, particularly regarding the performance on graphs with higher sparsity and the implications of external events on explanations. Lastly, to elevate the acceptance rating, we recommend a more robust discussion of the broader implications of their findings and further empirical validation of the benefits of temporal motifs in diverse applications.
