Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents MIDAS, a novel framework for gradually increasing model depth by stacking middle layers instead of the last layers, which enhances training efficiency and improves performance on reasoning tasks. The authors provide empirical analysis demonstrating that MIDAS outperforms baseline models on specific reasoning primitive problems, despite similar perplexity levels. The work establishes a connection between the inductive bias of stacking layers and the looped transformer architecture, suggesting potential for further research into this bias.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed MIDAS variant effectively improves training efficiency compared to baselines.
2. Empirical results show significant performance gains on reasoning primitive problems.
3. The paper is well-written and presents a clear rationale for the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
1. The benchmarked models (1B and 2B parameters) are smaller than commonly used models (e.g., 7B, 13B), raising concerns about the scalability of the approach.
2. The improvement in reasoning tasks is marginal compared to the drop in memorization performance, suggesting the need for additional reasoning benchmarks to validate findings.
3. There are minor typographical errors in the text.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the scalability analysis by including larger model sizes in their experiments to assess whether MIDAS can effectively replace existing baselines. Additionally, we suggest conducting an ablation study to clarify the choice of the UL2 objective and its impact on training outcomes. It would also be beneficial to evaluate MIDAS on a broader range of reasoning and common-sense tasks, as seen in the Llama paper, to strengthen comparisons. Lastly, we encourage the authors to address the identified typographical errors for clarity.
