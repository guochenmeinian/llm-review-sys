### Key Points
This paper presents a study on online Bayesian persuasion where the sender lacks knowledge of the prior distribution and the receiver's utility function. The authors propose an online learning algorithm that achieves square-root regret while also establishing lower bounds that demonstrate the unavoidable exponential dependency on the number of states and actions. Additionally, they adapt an algorithm for the PAC model that yields a nontrivial sample complexity bound.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The problem addressed is meaningful and technically interesting, with the concept of slices being natural and powerful.  
- The work significantly improves upon previous studies by simultaneously learning the prior and utility, which is a notable contribution.  
- The algorithm's design, particularly the high-dimensional binary search in a non-standard representation of signaling schemes, is an innovative technical novelty.  
- The results are comprehensive, providing both matching lower and upper bounds on regret.

Weaknesses:  
- The proposed algorithm may have exponential running time due to the number of vertices in the polytopes being exponential in $d$ or $n$, and this computational complexity is not discussed.  
- An instance-optimal bound would be more compelling, and further discussion on the PAC model's optimality is desired.  
- Some sections, particularly below Definition 1, are dense and could benefit from clearer notation and explanations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the computational complexity of their algorithm, including a computational-hardness result. Additionally, please define the variable $B$ in Algorithm 1 more clearly and briefly compare related works in Appendix A to highlight the distinctions from your approach. It may also be beneficial to clarify the setup in Section 6, particularly what constitutes a "sample." Finally, consider addressing how the results would change if the receiver only observes the sender's signal rather than their strategy.
