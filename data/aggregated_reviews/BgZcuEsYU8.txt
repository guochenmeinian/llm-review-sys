### Key Points
This paper presents a novel causal inference framework for closed-loop optogenetics behavioral studies, developing a method for estimating sequential excursion effects that captures local causal contrasts within the same treatment group. The authors propose an IPW estimator with theoretical guarantees of consistency and asymptotic normality, accommodating positivity violations and longer treatment sequences. Empirical validation is provided through real-world applications, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in revealing longitudinal causal effects obscured by standard methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The utility and implications of counterfactual causal effects under dynamic treatment policies are well-described.
- The authors provide empirical validation by applying their method to an existing Nature paper, corroborating their computational results with the original authors.
- The proposed framework is the first formal causal inference approach based on HR-MSMs for closed-loop optogenetics, addressing challenges like positivity violations and "treatment-confounder" feedback.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental results rely solely on linear or generalized linear models for $m$, raising questions about the method's applicability beyond linear models.
- The focus on a specialized causal graph limits the discussion of broader methodological advancements in causal inference, leaving unclear distinctions from existing temporal causal inference methods.
- The experimental evaluation lacks sufficient baselines, making it difficult to assess the proposed framework's performance against existing methods.
- The presentation of experimental results is primarily descriptive, lacking quantitative metrics for performance evaluation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of claims and definitions, particularly regarding the treatment notation (G and A) to avoid confusion. Additionally, we suggest explicitly introducing the problem settings in Section 2, separating them from the literature review to enhance reader understanding. The authors should consider adding more baseline methods in their experiments to strengthen the evaluation of their proposed framework. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to conduct simulation studies that demonstrate the advantages of their method in estimating complex local causal effects, and to incorporate quantitative metrics in their experimental results to provide a more robust performance evaluation.
