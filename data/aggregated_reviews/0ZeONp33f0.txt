Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical exploration of the expressiveness of graph neural networks (GNNs) by establishing equivalences with constant-depth arithmetic circuits. The authors introduce a new variant called C-GNNs, demonstrating that these can compute the same functions as arithmetic circuits, uniformly across various activation functions. The work aims to clarify the computational limitations of GNNs, suggesting that enhancing their expressivity may require more complex architectures beyond simple scaling.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a novel perspective on GNN expressiveness, contributing significantly to the existing literature and potentially inspiring future research.
- The proofs are well-structured, with a clear outline in the main text and detailed presentations in the appendix.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation may not meet the expectations of a NeurIPS audience, lacking clarity in articulating contributions and context within existing literature.
- The introduction is overly lengthy and contains irrelevant content, which detracts from the main contributions of the paper. Additionally, some concepts are not adequately explained before their use, leading to confusion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and conciseness of the introduction by removing irrelevant sections and consolidating repeated contributions. Consider moving some content to a related work section to enhance focus on the paper's contributions. Ensure all concepts are defined before use, particularly terms like "existential theory of real numbers" and the class $\mathrm{FAC}_R^0$. Clarify the notation in lines 252-254 regarding projection and non-linearities, and define symbols such as the star operator in line 202. Additionally, address the relationship with existing literature, particularly regarding the WL tests and the implications of the results for deep learning applications. Finally, we suggest including numerical experiments to demonstrate theoretical findings and providing a more thorough discussion on the limitations of GNNs in relation to arithmetic circuits with non-linear gates.
