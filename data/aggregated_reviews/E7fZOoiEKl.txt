Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents FuseFL, a method designed to tackle the non-IID data challenge in one-shot federated learning (OFL) by progressively fusing models from multiple clients. The authors argue that this approach mitigates the isolation problem, which leads to local overfitting on spurious features. FuseFL aims to learn invariant features through a block-wise fusion process without increasing total communication costs, albeit requiring additional communication rounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FuseFL achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across various non-IID settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed algorithm is novel and well-motivated, addressing a significant problem in OFL research.
- The experimental evaluation is diverse, validating the effectiveness of FuseFL through extensive testing.

Weaknesses:
- FuseFL communicates over multiple rounds, which may classify it as few-shot FL rather than one-shot FL; comparisons with other FL algorithms like FedAvg should be included for fairness.
- Important baselines, such as the CoBoosting algorithm, are missing from evaluations, limiting comprehensive comparisons.
- The paper lacks experiments with higher heterogeneity levels and does not adequately discuss the security implications of multiple communication rounds, which could increase vulnerability to attacks.
- The theoretical explanations need more rigor, and the fusion strategy is not clearly described.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the theoretical analysis by providing a clear notation and definition section, particularly regarding the distinctions between nuisance and spurious features. Additionally, the authors should include evaluations against the CoBoosting baseline and test with higher heterogeneity levels. A discussion on security vulnerabilities and potential mitigations should be added to inform readers of the trade-offs associated with FuseFL. Finally, we suggest enhancing the description of the fusion strategy to ensure it is comprehensible.
