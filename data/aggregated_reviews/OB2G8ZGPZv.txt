### Key Points
This paper presents a novel optimization algorithm called ROSA, which combines randomized optimization, simulated annealing, and surrogate optimization using polyharmonic spline surrogates. The authors propose that ROSA is particularly effective for multi-modal, derivative-free optimization in high-dimensional spaces, demonstrating significant computational efficiency and superior performance on various synthetic benchmark functions and real-world problems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed ROSA algorithm effectively addresses high-dimensional optimization challenges, especially with limited function evaluations.
- Experimental results indicate that ROSA outperforms competing methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency across a range of benchmark functions.
- The modular design of ROSA enhances its adaptability to different optimization problems, contributing valuable flexibility to the field.

Weaknesses:
- The method section lacks clarity regarding the implementation of the proposed algorithm; relocating the algorithm description from the appendix to the main text would enhance readability.
- The evaluation metric focuses solely on mean best values across trials; including visualizations that illustrate how ROSA and baseline methods approximate benchmark functions would provide clearer insights into the algorithm's performance.
- Figures in the appendix are difficult to read due to small font sizes; increasing the font size for labels and captions in Figures B and C would improve clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method section by moving the algorithm description to the main text. Additionally, incorporating visualizations that depict the performance of ROSA against benchmark functions would enhance understanding. Finally, we suggest increasing the font size in the appendix figures to ensure readability and better convey performance differences across methods.
