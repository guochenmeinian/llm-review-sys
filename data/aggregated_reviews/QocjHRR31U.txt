Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents BertaQA, a dataset designed to evaluate the cultural knowledge of LLMs, specifically focusing on Basque culture. The dataset includes multiple-choice questions in both English and Basque, covering local and global knowledge across eight categories. Experiments reveal that LLMs perform better on global topics than local ones, highlighting the potential for knowledge transfer from low-resource languages to high-resource ones. However, the analysis lacks depth regarding cultural aspects and the dataset's creation process.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset includes professionally translated samples, ensuring high-quality parallel data in English and Basque.
- It allows for nuanced comparisons of LLM performance concerning low-resource culture-specific knowledge.
- The evaluation of models in both languages provides insights into cross-lingual capabilities and knowledge transfer.

Weaknesses:
- The scope is limited to Basque culture, reducing generalizability to other minority cultures.
- There is insufficient detail on the data collection, categorization, and translator quality, which affects reproducibility.
- The results section lacks surprising findings, and the analysis of model errors is minimal.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the documentation of the dataset creation process, including details about the human annotators, quality assurance measures, and potential biases. Additionally, a more thorough analysis of the most difficult questions would enhance the paper's relevance. The authors should also provide evidence for claims regarding the inability to find questions in BertaQA through online searches and clarify the statement about the correlation between local and global performance metrics. Finally, expanding the dataset to include multiple cultures would increase its impact and applicability.
