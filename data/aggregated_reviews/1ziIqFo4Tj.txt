Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new method for shape correspondence called HOPE, which utilizes k-hop neighborhoods as pairwise descriptors to enhance accuracy and smoothness in shape matching. The authors propose that their method improves upon the 2D-GEM method by engaging with a broader neighborhood context and not relying on Laplacian eigenfunctions. The method is validated through extensive testing on various benchmarks, including SCAPE, TOSCA, and TOPKIDS, yielding promising results in both isometric and non-isometric scenarios. Additionally, the paper examines iterative map refinement methods using truncated basis, highlighting that such methods, including the use of k-eigen vectors or singular vectors, tend to align clusters rather than individual points, leading to accuracy issues. The authors assert that their k-hop algorithm can recover the ground truth map under specific conditions, supported by rigorous proofs in Section 4.2. They demonstrate superior performance compared to the ZoomOut method across various datasets, emphasizing that HOPE outperforms baselines even in cases of inconsistent triangulations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a descriptor that shows improvement over previous methods, particularly in partial shape matching.
- The methodology is well-structured and theoretically sound, with a clear explanation of the proposed approach.
- Extensive testing demonstrates superior results compared to existing techniques, particularly in isometric and non-isometric shape registration.
- The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of the limitations of existing methods and the advantages of their approach.
- Experimental results show significant improvements over baseline methods, particularly in accuracy and consistency.
- The inclusion of source code for HOPE allows for further testing and validation by reviewers.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the method is limited, as it closely resembles the 2D-GEM approach, raising concerns about its originality.
- The paper lacks clarity and readability, particularly in technical sections, which hinders comprehension of key concepts and formulations.
- Experimental results do not consistently show significant improvements over the baseline, and the analysis of parameter sensitivity is insufficient.
- There is a limited exploration of non-isometric datasets, and the impact of initial match quality is not adequately addressed.
- The reliance on triangulations is acknowledged as a limitation, which may affect the method's applicability in certain scenarios.
- The initial typo in Theorem 3.1 could lead to misunderstandings, although it does not alter the proof's conclusion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and readability of the paper, particularly in the technical sections, by providing explicit definitions and clearer formulations for key equations. We also suggest improving the presentation of Theorem 3.1 to prevent potential misunderstandings related to the typo. Additionally, we recommend conducting a more thorough comparative analysis against recent methods to highlight the advantages of HOPE, including reporting mean geodesic error values alongside performance metrics. It would be beneficial to explore a wider range of datasets and address the robustness of the method concerning topological variations. Finally, a detailed discussion on parameter sensitivity and guidelines for parameter selection should be included to enhance the practical applicability of the method, as well as further discussion on the implications of the triangulation dependency in Section 6 to enhance understanding of the method's limitations.
