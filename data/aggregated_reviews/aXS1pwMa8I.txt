Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for 3D surface reconstruction from point clouds using a patchwise rotation equivariant neural network. The authors propose a patch-level pose-invariant representation (PPIR) to enhance the model's ability to generalize to unseen 3D rotations. The method employs a displacement optimization loss and patch discrimination loss, demonstrating superior performance on various datasets compared to existing methods. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The use of equivariant models to optimize model capacity is a commendable approach, particularly given the rotational similarities in point cloud patches.
- The results indicate state-of-the-art performance in surface reconstruction tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The contributions appear to be a combination of existing ideas rather than novel concepts, with prior works such as NVF, E-GraphONet, and Zhao et al. providing foundational elements.
- The PCA-based alignment method lacks robustness, as it may not handle variations in point cloud patches effectively. The reliance on the furthest point for axis orientation resolution is questionable.
- The design choice of PCA-alignment seems arbitrary; a comparison with E-GraphONet on occupancy field prediction would strengthen the argument for its effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the robustness of the PCA-based alignment method and clarify its limitations. Additionally, consider incorporating comparisons with other equivariant layers, such as Vector-Neurons and SE(3)-Transformers, to justify the chosen approach. An ablation study on the three modules of the proposed framework would provide valuable insights into their contributions. Furthermore, addressing the computational cost of the proposed method in relation to existing techniques would enhance the paper's clarity and applicability. Lastly, including a discussion on the implications of using dense point clouds versus sparse or noisy data would strengthen the overall analysis.
