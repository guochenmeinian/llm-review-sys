Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates various sampling strategies for Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding in neural machine translation, focusing on the proposed epsilon-sampling approach. The authors evaluate popular methods, including ancestral, nucleus, and top-k sampling, and demonstrate that epsilon sampling significantly outperforms these methods as well as beam search across four language pairs. The paper also discusses the impact of sampling temperature and conducts a hyperparameter search for optimal settings. The findings are validated through human evaluations and Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a comprehensive comparison of popular sampling strategies for MBR decoding, offering valuable insights into their relative strengths and weaknesses.
- The proposed epsilon-sampling approach effectively prunes low-probability tokens, enhancing performance for long sequences.
- The experimental validation, including human evaluations and MQM assessments, supports the authors' claims regarding the superiority of epsilon sampling.

Weaknesses:
- MBR decoding is noted to be computationally expensive and impractical for many use cases.
- The evaluation is limited to four language pairs, suggesting a need for broader testing to enhance the robustness of the findings.
- The authors should provide a more detailed plan for addressing the limitations mentioned in the paper and include ablation studies to isolate the factors contributing to epsilon sampling's performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the computational challenges of MBR decoding and explore potential solutions for latency-sensitive applications. Additionally, expanding the evaluation to include more language pairs would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the sampling strategies. We also suggest that the authors include ablation studies to clarify the impact of specific factors on the performance of epsilon sampling and outline a detailed plan for addressing the limitations identified in their work.
