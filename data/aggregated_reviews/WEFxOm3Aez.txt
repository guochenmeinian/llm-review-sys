Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents RelBench, a dataset that collects relational databases with associated predictive tasks, allowing for benchmarking of relational deep learning (RDL) solutions. The authors propose a comprehensive evaluation of RDL against various baselines, including a case study comparing RDL to an expert data scientist. The submission highlights the effectiveness of RDL in predictive tasks and emphasizes the dataset's potential for broader applications beyond RDL.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- RelBench is a significant contribution, providing a collection of relational databases with predictive tasks that can benefit various research areas.
- The experimental section is thorough, demonstrating RDL's effectiveness and providing extensive details in the supplementary material.
- The case study indicates that RDL can match human analyst performance while being significantly faster.

Weaknesses:
- The baselines in the experimental study are weak, lacking sufficient discussion of prior work.
- There is inadequate detail on the implementation of the RDL infrastructure and the resources required to run it.
- The claim that "RDLs reduce the amount of work required by an order of magnitude" is unconvincing due to insufficient evidence.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation by reducing verbosity and correcting typos, particularly in sections where excessive detail could be moved to the appendix. Additionally, the authors should strengthen the baseline comparisons by including discussions of relevant prior work, particularly graph embedding methods not based on GNNs. It is crucial to provide more details on the RDL infrastructure, including resource requirements and the effort involved in preparing RDBs for RDL. Clarifying the argument regarding the time savings of RDL, especially in relation to unknown RDBs, is essential. Finally, including preprocessing details in the appendix would enhance the reproducibility of the results.
