### Key Points
This paper presents a balanced data-sharing marketplace designed for entities with diverse datasets and machine learning models. The marketplace aims to enhance model refinement through data contributions while maximizing total interim social utilities, adhering to constraints for equitable contributions and receptions. The authors propose a formal model addressing the data exchange problem, including a utility function and a social-welfare algorithm. The paper establishes NP-hardness and introduces polynomial-time approximation algorithms, supported by simulations on a road network dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The problem addressed is significant and offers both theoretical and practical insights.  
- The theoretical analysis is robust, with solid theorems and NP-hardness results.  
- The proposed algorithms demonstrate provable guarantees and outperform benchmarks in simulations.

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty of the techniques is questionable, as they largely follow existing methodologies.  
- The empirical evaluation is weak, with concerns about the practical applicability of the results.  
- Key concepts, such as the definition of ML-based agents and the specifics of utility balance, are insufficiently elaborated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of definitions, particularly for ML-based agents and the concept of "loss in the refined model." Additionally, it would be beneficial to specify the range of values for constraints (1) and (2) and to elaborate on the enforcement mechanisms for maintaining utility balance. We suggest including more experiments to strengthen the empirical evaluation and clarifying the relationship between the house allocation problem and the data market problem. Finally, addressing the practical implications of the BALANCE condition and providing more realistic data scenarios for simulations would enhance the paper's relevance.
