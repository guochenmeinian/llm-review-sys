### Key Points
RePoseDM presents a novel approach to pose-guided person image synthesis, utilizing recurrent pose alignment and gradient guidance to enhance photorealism and pose accuracy. The method outperforms traditional CNN-based techniques in both qualitative and quantitative assessments across large-scale benchmarks and user studies. It also demonstrates compatibility with text-based diffusion models and shows promise in applications like person re-identification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
1. The innovative integration of recurrent pose alignment and gradient guidance effectively addresses spatial feature transformation and detail preservation challenges.
2. The methodology is versatile, proving useful in downstream applications such as person re-identification.
3. The experiments are well-explained, with adequate baseline comparisons and high-quality qualitative results.

**Weaknesses:**
1. The method's complexity raises concerns regarding computational efficiency and scalability.
2. Visual improvements over baseline methods are limited.
3. Some explanations are unclear, particularly regarding the iterative process and the definition of "equivariant," which lacks adequate reference and clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We suggest improving the clarity of the methodology, particularly in Figure 1, which is overwhelming and difficult to interpret. Additionally, we recommend including more detailed explanations of the iterative pose feature refinement process and the implications of the number of iterations used. Furthermore, we believe that the motivation and Figure 8 should be incorporated into the main paper for better context.
