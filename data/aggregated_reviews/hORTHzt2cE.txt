Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the RoleAgent framework, designed to create scalable, high-quality role-playing agents from raw scripts without extensive human annotation. The framework comprises two main stages: building, which utilizes a hierarchical memory system to extract and summarize agent profiles, and interacting, which employs a novel four-step interaction mechanism. The authors also introduce RoleAgentBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark for assessing the framework's effectiveness, supported by extensive experiments demonstrating its advantages over existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The framework innovatively automates agent creation from raw scripts, enhancing scalability by eliminating the need for manual annotation.
- The hierarchical memory system and dynamic interaction mechanism are well-developed and innovative.
- The comprehensive evaluation benchmark provides a standardized method for assessing agent quality.
- The paper is clearly written and well-structured, facilitating reader comprehension.

Weaknesses:
- Some methodological details, particularly regarding hierarchical memory construction and dynamic importance scoring, lack clarity and could benefit from additional examples.
- The evaluation focuses on a limited set of scripts, raising concerns about the generalizability of the framework across different genres and contexts.
- The memory retrieval process and its effectiveness in reflecting specific agent features based on queries require further analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve methodological clarity by providing more detailed explanations and examples, especially for the hierarchical memory construction and dynamic importance scoring mechanisms. Additionally, we suggest including a more diverse set of scripts in the evaluation to enhance the framework's generalizability. Addressing the performance of GLM-4 in this context could be beneficial, as well as exploring how memory ranking correlation scores affect LLM retrieval. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide a more detailed breakdown of the computational resources required for both the building and interacting stages, and to consider integrating a real-time feedback mechanism to dynamically adjust agent behavior based on user interactions.
