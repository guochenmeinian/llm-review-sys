Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on robust nonparametric regression under adversarial poisoning attacks, where a fraction of training samples are corrupted. The authors propose robust estimators, including a correction step that projects the estimator into the space of Lipschitz functions, to mitigate the impact of adversarial samples. Theoretical results include upper and lower bounds on convergence rates for both $\ell_2$ and $\ell_\infty$ losses using Huber loss minimization. Numerical simulations demonstrate the proposed methods outperform standard techniques in low-dimensional scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a significant problem in nonparametric regression, focusing on adversarial settings, which can enhance the robustness of data-analytic methods.  
- The theoretical results provide asymptotically tight bounds for $\ell_\infty$ loss and a novel correction method for $\ell_2$ loss.  
- Numerical simulations validate the theoretical findings.

Weaknesses:  
- The experimental evaluation is limited, raising questions about the methods' robustness in real-world applications.  
- The assumptions, particularly regarding the probability density function, may restrict practical applicability.  
- The lack of runtime analysis for the corrected estimator and absence of proof sketches hinder understanding of the contributions.  
- The organization of the paper could be improved, and there are issues with notation and clarity in certain sections.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental evaluation by including real regression datasets and exploring the effects of hyperparameter changes. Additionally, providing proof sketches in the main body would enhance clarity regarding the theoretical contributions. The authors should consider revising the assumptions to broaden applicability and include a section on preliminaries to define key concepts and notation. Lastly, we suggest proofreading the manuscript to eliminate spelling and expression errors, and ensuring references are listed in alphabetical order.
