Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new algorithm, HCCRootedTreeFit, for fitting tree metrics to a given distance matrix, focusing on minimizing the â„“1 distortion. The authors explore the relationship between hyperbolicity vectors and tree embedding errors, providing a theoretical foundation and extensive experimental evaluation. Results indicate optimal performance on tree-like datasets, while common datasets are shown to lack tree-like structure, suggesting a need for refined geometric approaches in machine learning tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The algorithm is theoretically sound and thoroughly evaluated, demonstrating optimal performance on tree-like datasets.  
2. The work provides valuable insights into dataset characteristics and has significant potential for practical applications, particularly in machine learning and data analysis.  
3. The authors establish a connection between tree fitting and hierarchical correlation clustering, enhancing the theoretical framework.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The evaluation primarily focuses on tree-like datasets, limiting understanding of the algorithm's performance on a broader range of datasets.  
2. The paper lacks clarity in explaining the construction of trees and the connection to existing tree fitting approaches, making it difficult to assess the proposed method's advantages.  
3. The presentation is hindered by a lack of comprehensive definitions and explanations, leading to difficulties in readability and understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including performance assessments on a wider variety of datasets, particularly those that are not tree-like. Additionally, we suggest elaborating on the main ideas of the proposed algorithmic approach in Section 3.3, specifically detailing how the tree is constructed. It would also be beneficial to discuss how the proposed method compares to existing approaches, such as the QuadTree method, and to consider it as a baseline in experiments. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the "highly connected" concept in Algorithm 1 and address the appearance of negative weights in line 269. Lastly, enhancing the comprehensiveness of table captions and providing qualitative examples of the proposed method's superiority would significantly improve the paper's clarity and impact.
