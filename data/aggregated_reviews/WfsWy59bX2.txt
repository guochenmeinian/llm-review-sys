Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on linear regression where sensitive features of data points are anonymized through look-alike clustering, replacing these features with cluster averages. The authors analyze the out-of-sample expected squared error of the minimum 2-norm regression predictor compared to the look-alike predictor, particularly in asymptotic settings as dimensions and sample sizes grow. The work identifies scenarios where the look-alike predictor outperforms the minimum 2-norm predictor, especially under low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Additionally, the authors propose that a precise quantitative theory is essential for understanding key factors affecting generalization, such as the relationship between cluster centers and model parameters, as well as the influence of cluster size and number. They acknowledge the existence of efficient algorithms for learning cluster membership under Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), including spectral clustering, and discuss the implications of their findings in the context of sample complexity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper provides a precise analysis of how replacing sensitive features with cluster averages affects the generalization of linear regression models.  
- It demonstrates that anonymization can improve predictor performance in certain contexts, supported by sound theoretical results and numerical experiments.  
- The writing is clear, and the structure is coherent, making the complex ideas accessible.  
- The authors provide a clear rationale for the importance of a quantitative theory in understanding generalization thresholds.  
- The discussion of various algorithms for cluster membership learning demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the field.  
- The authors' responsiveness to reviewer feedback indicates a commitment to improving the paper.

Weaknesses:  
- The specificity of the data model limits the generalizability of the findings, with insufficient discussion on extending results to broader settings.  
- The paper lacks a comprehensive literature review on related data anonymization methods and does not adequately address limitations or potential societal impacts.  
- Some theoretical statements do not clearly illustrate the dependence on cluster size and number, and there are minor typographical errors throughout.  
- The analysis of sample complexity in relation to their specific error measure has not been fully developed.  
- The assumption regarding the parameter conditions for the overparameterized regime may be seen as an artifact of the analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the feasibility of extending their results beyond the specific data model presented. Additionally, a section addressing the limitations of the work should be included, along with a literature survey on other anonymization methods. Clarifying the theoretical statements to explicitly show the dependence on cluster size and number would enhance the paper's rigor. We also suggest including empirical examples beyond linear regression to demonstrate the broader applicability of look-alike clustering. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the analysis of sample complexity concerning their specific error measure \(||M\Lambda - \tilde{M}\tilde{\Lambda}||\) to enhance the rigor of their findings. Lastly, we suggest that the authors clarify the implications of the parameter conditions for the overparameterized regime, particularly regarding the assumption that \(\psi_d - \psi_p\) should be outside the interval (0.5, 2).
