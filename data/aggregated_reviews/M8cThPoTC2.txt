### Key Points
This paper presents a measurement study of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to assess their vulnerability to domain fronting attacks. The authors identify that 22 out of 30 CDNs tested allow effective domain fronting, which has implications for both malicious and non-malicious uses, particularly in regions with heavy censorship. The methodology includes passive and active DNS measurements to discover domains associated with CDNs and to evaluate their domain fronting capabilities. The findings challenge the assumption that only large CDNs are used for popular websites and highlight the ongoing relevance of domain fronting in the current Internet landscape.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents a clear methodology, making it easy to follow.
- The findings have real-world implications, raising awareness among CDN providers about domain fronting vulnerabilities.
- The automated method proposed for detecting domain fronting is efficient compared to manual detection methods.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the work is somewhat diminished due to prior research on domain fronting.
- The paper lacks a comprehensive discussion of countermeasures against domain fronting attacks.
- Responsible disclosures were only made to two CDNs, which raises ethical concerns about potential misuse of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the implications of their findings by addressing the potential risks associated with domain fronting, including gang clustering and realistic attack behaviors. Additionally, the authors should provide a detailed comparison with the concurrent study to clarify the distinctions in approach and outcomes. It would also be beneficial to expand the responsible disclosure process to include all affected CDNs before publication. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors evaluate the effectiveness of their autodiscovery methods and clarify the caveats regarding the interpretation of certificate SAN fields. Lastly, including an analysis of how many malicious domains can be domain fronted would enhance the paper's contribution to the field.
