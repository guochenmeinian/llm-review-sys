### Key Points
This paper presents UniSDF, an enhanced NeuS architecture designed for reconstructing photorealistic reflective surfaces in real-world scenes. The method employs two separate MLPs to model reflective and base colors, blending them using learned weights to achieve final colors. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple datasets indicate that the method outperforms existing baselines and minimizes geometric artifacts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed architecture effectively represents the reflective radiance field, with original contributions such as blending inspired by NeRFRen and coarse-to-fine training from Neuralangelo, enhancing reconstruction quality in real-world scenarios.  
- The method demonstrates robust and high-quality reconstructions, surpassing other baselines across various datasets.  
- The paper is well-written, with clear figures and thorough experimental evaluations.

Weaknesses:  
- A significant weakness is the lack of physical interpretation in the final color computation, leading to ambiguity regarding the assumptions for the reconstructed scene.  
- The model does not account for variations in surface roughness, raising concerns about its performance on surfaces with spatially varying roughness.  
- The reliance on two radiance fields and a weight field results in time-consuming volume rendering, even with iNGP implementation.  
- The contributions are seen as limited, primarily extending existing methods without substantial novelty.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the physical interpretation of the final color computation to clarify the meaning of each color component. Additionally, addressing the model's handling of reflections on surfaces with varying roughness would enhance its robustness. We suggest conducting ablation studies to explore the impact of different normals in the reflected view direction and loss formulations. Furthermore, clarifying the necessity of the learned weight for mixing outputs from the two radiance branches would provide deeper insights into the model's behavior. Lastly, we encourage the authors to consider extending the work to handle sparse views and improve efficiency by reducing the reliance on multiple fields and volume rendering.
