Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a dual-level test-time adaptation framework aimed at addressing the challenges of dense out-of-distribution (OOD) detection under domain and semantic shifts. The authors propose a two-step approach: the first step involves selective test-time batch normalization to adapt to identified domain shifts, while the second step employs an anomaly-aware self-training procedure to enhance detection capabilities for novel classes. The framework demonstrates competitive performance across various benchmarks, including those with significant domain shifts. Additionally, the authors emphasize the practical ability of their model to handle different degrees of shifts, acknowledging the challenges of isolating specific domain shifts due to the intermingling of various conditions in datasets like Road Anomaly. They provide visualizations and additional experiments demonstrating their model's stable performance across isolated domain shifts, including fog, color shifting, and Gaussian blur.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles the realistic and complex task of open-set semantic segmentation, effectively considering both domain and semantic shifts.
- Experimental results indicate significant improvements in performance on several OOD segmentation benchmarks, validating the proposed method's effectiveness.
- The authors demonstrate consistent improvements in OOD detection performance across various domain shifts, as evidenced by the results in Table E3.
- The method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art, PEBAL, in the online Fishyscapes testing set, showcasing its effectiveness.
- The writing is well-organized, with clear motivation and a reasonable methodological approach.

Weaknesses:
- The manuscript only addresses dense OOD detection under geolocation shifts, neglecting other significant types of domain shifts such as weather conditions and day-to-night transitions.
- The complexity of isolating specific domain shifts in datasets remains a challenge, which may limit the clarity of results.
- The proposed framework's reliance on gradient-based optimization during inference raises concerns about computational overhead, which should be quantified.
- The clarity of the method could be improved, particularly in visualizations and the definition of key terms and parameters.
- The metrics used for evaluation may not fully align with the requirements of anomaly segmentation, necessitating additional comparisons with relevant metrics.
- The exploration of future datasets with clearly defined domain shifts is acknowledged but is beyond the scope of the current paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the coverage of domain shifts by experimentally addressing various types, including weather and illumination changes, to enhance the robustness of their findings. Additionally, it is crucial to report the time and memory overhead associated with the proposed framework to assess its applicability in real-time scenarios. The authors should also clarify the method's applicability to models without batch normalization layers and consider including a more detailed visualization in Figure 2 to better illustrate the framework's components. Lastly, we suggest expanding the evaluation metrics to include those specifically relevant to anomaly segmentation, such as sIoU, PPV, and F1 scores, and improving the clarity of their analysis by including the examination of domain shifts in isolation in the final version of the manuscript.
