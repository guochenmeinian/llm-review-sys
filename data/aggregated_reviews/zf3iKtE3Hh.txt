### Key Points
This paper investigates the prevalence of solvable text-based CAPTCHAs across 3,000 websites, revealing that over 20% of these CAPTCHAs can be bypassed using publicly available solvers. The authors present a comprehensive dataset of over 15,000 CAPTCHA samples from 20 different schemes and demonstrate that their object detection model can solve 80% of CAPTCHA challenges from previously unseen schemes with minimal fine-tuning. The study raises awareness about the inadequacy of text-based CAPTCHAs and the potential risks they pose to web applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper employs a sound methodology and presents surprising findings from a large-scale analysis.
- It includes a comprehensive dataset and an open-source tool that can benefit future research.
- The authors conducted a large-scale notification campaign to inform affected websites.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a comparative analysis with reCAPTCHA and does not sufficiently clarify its novelty, as it heavily relies on existing datasets and models.
- The evaluation of CAPTCHA solvers is limited, and the dataset scope is questioned, as it only includes 3,000 websites despite starting from a larger corpus.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper's novelty and contributions, particularly in relation to existing CAPTCHA solvers. Additionally, a comparative analysis with reCAPTCHA would provide a broader perspective on CAPTCHA effectiveness. To enhance the dataset, consider expanding the scope to include more websites and providing insights into the reasons for unresponsive domains. Furthermore, we suggest implementing a meta-CAPTCHA solver that predicts which solver will work best for a given CAPTCHA and exploring the use of mouse movements as a potential detection mechanism for automated solutions. Finally, conducting multiple attempts to solve CAPTCHAs could yield a more accurate assessment of the model's capabilities.
