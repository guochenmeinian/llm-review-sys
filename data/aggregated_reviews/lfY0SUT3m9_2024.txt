Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents shuffling gradient-based methods for nonconvex-linear and nonconvex-strongly concave minimax optimization problems. The authors propose algorithms that achieve state-of-the-art oracle complexity and establish complexity bounds under standard assumptions. The work includes numerical experiments to validate the proposed methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper is well-written, clearly articulating the state of the art and providing explicit assumptions for the proposed methods.  
2. Novel smoothing techniques are introduced, akin to Nesterov's approach, which provide a fresh perspective on nonconvex optimization.  
3. Two distinct algorithms are tailored for different problem settings, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the problem landscape.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The contribution is somewhat combinational, with limited novelty beyond existing techniques, and lacks a detailed comparison with previous stochastic algorithms for minimax optimization.  
2. The numerical experiments are insufficient, testing only Algorithm 1 and a single minimax model, which limits the evaluation of the proposed methods against state-of-the-art competitors.  
3. The proposed Algorithm 1 requires solving a maximization problem at each iteration, which may be computationally expensive.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with previous works by including a detailed analysis of how their results differ from existing stochastic gradient-based minimax optimization methods. A comparative table delineating oracle complexity alongside existing methods would be beneficial. Additionally, expanding the numerical experiments to include more complex minimax models and state-of-the-art competitors would strengthen the empirical validation of their methods. We also suggest clarifying the theoretical advantages of shuffling methods over nonshuffling methods, and addressing the computational cost associated with the maximization problem in Algorithm 1.
