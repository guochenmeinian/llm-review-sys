### Key Points
This paper presents a framework that utilizes video captioning networks to transcribe raw videos from scientific experiments into user actions. The network is fine-tuned using a limited set of (video, caption) pairs across different laboratory settings, such as semiconductors and wet chemistry, enabling the generation of workflows that accurately reflect user actions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The process from video data capture to automatic documentation effectively demonstrates the potential of multi-modal models in automating experiment documentation.
- The research direction is promising, leveraging versatile large multi-modal models for complex experimental procedures.
- The acquisition of data in realistic experimental setups is invaluable, and sharing this data would benefit the community.
- The writing is clear and accessible, aiding comprehension for a broad audience.

Weaknesses:
- The paper overstates its reliance on foundation models, as it primarily fine-tunes a pre-trained network, with the main contribution being the operational data processing pipeline.
- The method does not scale well with the complexity of user actions or experimental protocols due to its dependence on ground-truth user action annotations.
- The computational demands of developing the tool are not explicitly conveyed.
- The universality of the framework is ambiguous, raising questions about its applicability in other lab environments and scientific domains.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introductory section to clearly articulate the primary motivation and specific results achieved, enhancing understanding for readers from various domains. Additionally, including details on the computational resources required for training the multi-modal transformer would clarify feasibility. Addressing the framework's adaptability across different laboratory environments and other scientific fields is essential. The authors should also clarify the contribution of their work regarding foundation models to set appropriate expectations. Finally, discussing potential scalability challenges as experimental procedures become more complex would provide a more comprehensive view of the solution's applicability.
