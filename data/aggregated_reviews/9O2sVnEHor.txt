### Key Points
This paper presents the $r$-loopy Weisfeiler-Leman ($r$-$l$WL) test, an innovative hierarchy of graph isomorphism tests, alongside the corresponding GNN framework, $r$-$l$MPNN. The authors propose that this approach enhances the counting capabilities of previous algorithms, particularly in counting cycles up to length $r+2$ and homomorphisms of cactus graphs. Empirical validation indicates the expressiveness and performance of $r$-$l$MPNN across synthetic and real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The originality of the paper is notable, introducing a novel algorithm ($r$-$l$WL) and GNNs ($r$-$l$MPNN) that significantly enhance graph neural network expressivity, supported by rigorous theoretical proofs and empirical validation.  
- The ability to count homomorphisms of cactus graphs without additional explicit substructure counts is a key strength.  
- The paper is well-written, with clear explanations and a strong theoretical foundation.  

Weaknesses:  
- Some mathematical proofs are complex, potentially challenging for readers lacking a strong background in graph theory and GNNs; additional intuitive explanations or examples could improve accessibility.  
- The empirical validation could be expanded to include a broader range of real-world datasets to further demonstrate robustness and generalizability.  
- Certain terms, such as HASH, are undefined or unexplained, which may hinder understanding.  
- The motivation for focusing on cactus graphs is unclear and requires better justification.  
- The paper lacks sufficient comparison with subgraph GNNs beyond $3$-WL, such as $k$-OSANs, which could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve accessibility by providing additional intuitive explanations or examples for complex mathematical proofs. Expanding the empirical validation to include a wider array of real-world datasets would further demonstrate the robustness of the approach. Additionally, clarifying the definition of the HASH function and justifying the focus on cactus graphs would enhance the paper's clarity. A more detailed comparison with subgraph GNNs, particularly $k$-OSANs, should be included to address the limitations of the current evaluation.
