Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of strategic classification under partial information release, utilizing a Bayesian framework where agents possess a prior distribution over classifiers. The authors model the interaction as a Stackelberg game, where the principal reveals partial information to influence agents' strategies. The paper demonstrates that this approach can enhance classification accuracy compared to full or no information release. Theoretical contributions include NP-hardness results and efficient algorithms for specific cases, particularly for low-dimensional linear classifiers.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem of strategic classification is well-motivated, and the Bayesian setting is a reasonable extension of existing models.
- The introduction of oracle-efficient algorithms for low-dimensional classifiers is a significant contribution.
- The paper is well-written, with a clear presentation of theoretical results and practical examples that ground the concepts.

Weaknesses:
- Many positive results are contingent on strong constraints, suggesting inherent difficulties in the problem.
- The title does not adequately reflect the focus on "partial information release."
- Assumptions about the learner's knowledge of the true relation between features and labels, as well as the agents' prior distribution, may not hold in practice.
- The lack of empirical evaluation raises questions about the practical applicability of the proposed methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification of the model, particularly regarding the assumptions about the learner's knowledge and the agents' priors. Clarifying the role of the oracle in the agents' best-response problem would enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest revising the title to better reflect the emphasis on "partial information release." Incorporating empirical evaluations would strengthen the paper's practical relevance and applicability. Finally, addressing the implications of the fixed classifier assumption in dynamic environments would broaden the model's applicability.
