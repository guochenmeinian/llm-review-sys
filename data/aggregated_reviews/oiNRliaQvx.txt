### Key Points
This paper presents a multi-modal content-aware framework named MMPOI for location recommendations, addressing data scarcity by integrating multi-modal content information about locations. MMPOI employs pre-trained models for inter-modal conversion and utilizes a unified model to extract modality-specific features, bridging the semantic gap between different modalities. The framework introduces a Multi-Modal Trajectory Flow Graph (MTFG) and an adaptive multi-task Transformer to model users' multi-modal movement patterns for location recommendation tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-structured and easy to understand.
2. It effectively addresses the data sparsity issue in POI recommendations by incorporating multi-modal content, adding a novel dimension to the field.
3. The systematic exploration of challenges in applying multi-modal techniques to POI recommendations is commendable, with corresponding solutions proposed.

Weaknesses:
1. The lack of sufficient experiments or comparisons with the latest baselines raises questions about the method's effectiveness.
2. There is insufficient discussion on limitations, including computational complexity, scalability, and potential biases from pre-trained models.
3. The cosine similarity function used for modality-specific representation requires further justification regarding its effectiveness in addressing noise.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including comparisons with more recent studies like AGRAN and STHGCN, as well as conducting additional ablation experiments, such as a variant MMPOIùë§_{w/o}Geo&Geo graph to verify the geographic trajectory flow graph's effect. The authors should also clarify the settings of undefined parameters, such as $d_m$, $l_m$, and $V^G$, and ensure the dimension of $D^G$ is correctly specified. Furthermore, we suggest providing a detailed analysis of the training resources and efficiency associated with the use of pre-trained models, as well as justifying the choice of models like BLIP2 and Sentence-Bert. Lastly, the authors should address the robustness of the model to noisy data and clarify the differences between MMPOI and existing methods for mapping different modalities into the same latent space.
