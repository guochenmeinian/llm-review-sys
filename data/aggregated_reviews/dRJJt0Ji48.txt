Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Retrieval-Augmented Time series Diffusion (RATD) model, which integrates an embedding-based retrieval process with a reference-guided diffusion model to enhance time series forecasting. The proposed Extra Reference Modulated Attention (RMA) module facilitates the incorporation of retrieved reference time series during the denoising process. The authors demonstrate RATD's effectiveness across five real-world datasets, achieving competitive performance against various forecasting baselines, including diffusion models and transformers. The authors also highlight their method's innovations in model design, asserting that it effectively addresses core challenges in diffusion models for time series by leveraging limited datasets and modeling both periodic and trend components simultaneously.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a clear methodology.
- Comprehensive experiments demonstrate RATD's effectiveness across multiple datasets and retrieval mechanisms.
- The novel approach of leveraging retrieved historical time series for guidance is innovative and addresses existing limitations in time series diffusion models.
- The authors provide thorough responses to reviewer concerns, demonstrating a clear understanding of their method's contributions and innovations.
- The integration of retrieval and diffusion modeling is recognized as a promising approach, with specific advantages outlined, such as the iterative guidance mechanism and the performance of the RMA module.

Weaknesses:
- The technical novelty is moderate, as similar retrieval-augmented approaches exist in other domains, and the paper lacks sufficient justification for choosing diffusion models over other methods.
- Lingering concerns exist regarding the novelty of the proposed method, particularly in how it effectively addresses the core challenges of diffusion models in time series forecasting.
- Experimental comparisons are incomplete and not aligned with classical studies, raising concerns about reproducibility and the validity of results.
- The paper lacks systematic ablation tests and detailed explanations of model architectures, which are crucial for understanding the proposed method's effectiveness.
- Clarification is needed regarding the specific advantages of the base model and the retrieval-augmented solution compared to existing methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental setup by including more comprehensive comparisons with existing studies, particularly those using datasets like solar and wiki, and ensure alignment with classical forecasting horizons. Additionally, we suggest conducting systematic ablation tests to illustrate the specific architectural designs and their contributions to the model's performance. Providing detailed information on GPU memory usage and computational efficiency would also enhance the evaluation of the model's practicality. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions by explicitly detailing the advantages introduced by their base model and the retrieval-augmented solution. Finally, addressing the justification for the choice of diffusion models in time series forecasting compared to other methods would strengthen the paper's contribution.
