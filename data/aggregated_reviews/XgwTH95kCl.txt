Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework called Representation Factorization and Alignment (ReFA) for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) that addresses the challenges posed by uncertain missing modalities. The ReFA framework includes three core components: a Fine-grained Representation Factorization (FRF) module for extracting sentiment-relevant representations, a Hierarchical Mutual Information (HMI) maximization mechanism for aligning high-level semantics, and a Hierarchical Adversarial Learning (HAL) mechanism for robust joint multimodal representations. The authors demonstrate significant performance improvements through comprehensive experiments on datasets such as MOSI, MOSEI, and SIMS.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The ReFA framework effectively addresses the practical issue of missing modality information in MSA, showcasing real-world applicability.
2. The motivation and rationale for the proposed approach are clearly articulated, with strong logical coherence.
3. Comprehensive experiments validate the framework's effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art results across various datasets.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a detailed discussion on computational complexity and runtime performance compared to existing methods.
2. While innovative, the individual components of the framework have been explored in other contexts, limiting the perceived novelty.
3. There is insufficient discussion on the potential limitations of the approach, particularly regarding its generalizability to other multimodal tasks beyond sentiment analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on computational requirements and training time of the ReFA framework compared to baseline methods. Additionally, providing insights into the framework's performance with varying amounts of training data and its applicability to other multimodal tasks would enhance its versatility. The authors should also address potential limitations and biases in the datasets used, elaborating on the implications for model performance across different demographic groups. Finally, a more detailed examination of the societal impacts of their work, particularly concerning ethical concerns and privacy issues, would strengthen the paper's comprehensiveness.
