Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new relative entropy coding algorithm for compression without quantization, aiming to eliminate training-test mismatches in learned compression by avoiding discrete representations. The authors propose a novel greedy rejection sampling algorithm called the Greedy Rejection Sampling (GPRS) algorithm, which achieves runtime optimality and significantly improves runtime efficiency compared to existing algorithms like A* coding. The paper also introduces parallel and branch-and-bound variants of GPRS, demonstrating theoretical correctness and optimality in terms of code length and runtime.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper significantly enhances runtime efficiency for relative entropy coding algorithms, achieving linear runtime in KL divergence, which is conceptually simpler than A* coding.  
- The introduction of computationally efficient extensions (parallel GPRS and branch&bound GPRS) is based on non-trivial mathematical insights.  
- The algorithm demonstrates theoretically-optimal runtime in unimodal density ratio scenarios and combines solid empirical results with rigorous theoretical proofs.  
- The mathematical derivations are rigorous, and the paper is well-written, making it accessible to readers.  

Weaknesses:  
- Some technical contributions are not clearly outlined, making it difficult to understand the advantages over A* coding and naive rejection sampling.  
- The assumption of unimodal and one-dimensional distributions is strong and requires justification.  
- There is a lack of empirical comparison with standard rejection sampling and other recent methods, limiting the validation of claims.  
- The practical implications of the algorithm, particularly regarding runtime costs and application scenarios, are insufficiently discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their technical contributions, particularly in explaining why their new strategy is superior to A* coding and naive rejection sampling. A detailed discussion on the assumptions regarding unimodal and one-dimensional distributions is necessary. Additionally, we suggest including empirical comparisons with standard rejection sampling and recent methods to validate the advantages of GPRS. The authors should also elaborate on the practical applications of their algorithm and address the runtime costs associated with solving the ODE for $\sigma$. Finally, clarifying the implications of the stretching function and how it affects runtime would enhance the paper's clarity.
