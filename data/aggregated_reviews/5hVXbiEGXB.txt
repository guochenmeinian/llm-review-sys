Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the problem of Continual Domain Generalization over Temporal Drift (CDGTD), focusing on the challenge of adapting to gradually shifting data distributions over time. The authors propose the Evolving Standardization (EvoS) method, which employs a multi-scale attention module (MSAM) to predict and standardize features based on the evolving statistics of the current domain. The effectiveness of EvoS is demonstrated through experiments on various real-world datasets, including images and texts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a significant issue in machine learning, specifically the challenge of CDGTD, and introduces a novel approach with EvoS.
2. The necessity of learning evolving patterns to tackle temporal distribution shifts is well articulated.
3. The authors conduct thorough ablation studies and provide clear explanations throughout the paper.

Weaknesses:
1. The experimental setup is limited, as only a subset of datasets from the Wilds-Time benchmark is used; including MIMIC-Readmission and MIMIC-Mortality datasets would enhance the evaluation.
2. The paper lacks sufficient context and motivation for the proposed research problem, failing to distinguish it from continuous learning and test-time adaptation.
3. The complexity of the EvoS method is not adequately analyzed, and comparisons with more recent state-of-the-art continual learning methods are lacking.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental evaluation by including results on MIMIC-Readmission and MIMIC-Mortality datasets to ensure comprehensive assessments. Additionally, we suggest providing more context and motivation for the research problem to clarify its distinction from related areas. A detailed analysis of the computational requirements of the EvoS method should be included, along with comparisons to more recent state-of-the-art continual learning methods. Finally, consider visualizing the decision boundaries to qualitatively demonstrate the model's ability to capture temporal drift.
