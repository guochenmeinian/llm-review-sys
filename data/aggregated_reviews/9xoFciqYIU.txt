Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an individualized matrix regression method linked to self-attention, evaluated through theoretical and empirical results on simulated and real datasets. The authors propose a model that modulates common coefficients with sample-specific data derived from image patch similarities. The method is claimed to improve performance in medical image analysis, particularly in Alzheimer Brain MRI datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and provides an interesting theoretical treatment of individualized regression and its connection to transformers.
- The method is novel, addressing the one-model-fit-all issue and applicable to matrix-valued data.
- Empirical results demonstrate improved performance compared to related methods.

Weaknesses:
- The introduction mentions personalized interpretations without clear illustration in the main text.
- The method is only applied to small datasets, with limited experiments conducted.
- Several technical details remain unclear, such as the inverse operation of R and the determination of block sizes and factors.
- Claims of superiority lack sufficient hypothesis testing support, and the discussion section is notably short.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 2 to better explain the technical details of the proposed method. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed limitations section and include hypothesis test results in the appendix. It would be beneficial to address the scalability of the method and clarify the assumptions regarding the independence of slices in cross-validation. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors report mean and standard error instead of mean and standard deviation for better comparability of results. Lastly, addressing the blockiness of individualized coefficients in the ADNI data could enhance the method's applicability.
