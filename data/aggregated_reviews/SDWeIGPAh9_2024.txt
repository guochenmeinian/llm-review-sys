### Key Points
This paper presents a Typicalness-Aware Learning (TAL) approach to address overconfidence in deep neural networks (DNNs) for failure detection by computing a typicalness score for each sample. TAL dynamically adjusts logit magnitudes based on typicalness, allowing for flexible fitting of atypical samples while maintaining reliable confidence metrics. The authors evaluate TAL on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, demonstrating its adaptability across different model architectures. Additionally, the paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of the SIRC method in conjunction with the TAL framework for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and failure detection (FD) tasks. The authors utilized the SIRC_MSP_z variant, combining Maximum Softmax Probability with features, and employed a cosine measure for the TAL+SIRC combination. The training protocol for ImageNet experiments is detailed, including the use of a ResNet50 architecture and specific data augmentation techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a novel perspective on overconfidence, suggesting it arises from models conforming to inaccurate labels for atypical samples.
2. TAL effectively differentiates between typical and atypical samples, enhancing the reliability of confidence scores.
3. The method is model-agnostic, applicable to both Transformers and CNNs, showcasing its versatility.
4. The manuscript provides a clear and detailed training protocol for ImageNet experiments, enhancing reproducibility.
5. The results demonstrate that the TAL method significantly surpasses baseline performances, indicating its robustness.
6. The authors effectively address reviewer concerns and incorporate additional analyses to clarify their findings.

Weaknesses:
1. The definition of atypical samples lacks clarity, which may hinder the method's effectiveness; the authors should provide mathematical definitions and visual examples.
2. The implementation of typicality calculation and dynamic magnitude generation could benefit from more advanced designs.
3. The paper focuses solely on failure detection without analyzing the impact of TAL on classification accuracy.
4. There is a lack of clarity regarding the specific version of SIRC used and the combination of scores, which could confuse readers.
5. The manuscript does not include results for SIRC with the residual score on ImageNet+Textures, which some reviewers find important for a comprehensive evaluation.
6. The explanation of the underlying reasons for differences in feature means between ID and OOD data could be elaborated further.
7. Minor error noted: "pred" and "GT" in Fig. 2 should be swapped.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definition of atypical samples by providing mathematical definitions and visual examples. Additionally, exploring more advanced designs for typicality calculation and dynamic magnitude generation could enhance the implementation. The authors should also analyze the impact of TAL on classification accuracy, as this aspect is currently underexplored. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors explicitly state which version of SIRC is utilized and detail the scores combined. Including the results for SIRC with the residual score on ImageNet+Textures would provide a more complete analysis. We suggest revising the tables to clearly delineate training-free and training-based approaches. Additionally, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the underlying reasons for the observed differences in mean values of features between ID and OOD data for better understanding. Lastly, consider analyzing the impact of taking the square or cube root of the cosine score before SIRC to mitigate degradation in old FD tasks. Finally, correcting the minor error in Fig. 2 is necessary for accuracy.
