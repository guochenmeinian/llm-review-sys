Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents new theoretical advancements in decentralized stochastic asynchronous optimization, introducing two methods: Fragile SGD for homogeneous setups and Amelie SGD for heterogeneous setups. Both methods aim to achieve near-optimal time complexities under arbitrary heterogeneous computation and communication speeds. The authors establish new lower bounds for time complexities in these setups, demonstrating that their methods match these bounds up to logarithmic factors.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well-written and organized, making significant theoretical contributions by establishing new lower bounds for time complexities in decentralized asynchronous optimization. The introduction of Fragile SGD and Amelie SGD adds value to the field, and the innovative use of spanning trees enhances robustness against dynamic computation and communication times. The consideration of physical computation and communication times offers a more realistic perspective compared to previous works.

Weaknesses:  
1. The algorithms, while interpretable, may be challenging to implement in practical systems due to their reliance on a pivot worker, which necessitates greater computational and communication capabilities.  
2. There is limited experimental validation of the proposed methods, and the paper's structure is problematic, with one algorithm and experimental results relegated to the appendix.  
3. The comparison with previous works may not be fair, as the settings differ significantly, particularly regarding communication types and convergence metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical validation of their methods by providing solid experimental results that demonstrate both efficiency and final accuracy. Additionally, we suggest that the authors discuss the relationship between the pivot worker and the server more thoroughly, clarifying how the pivot worker's role impacts the overall framework. Finally, we advise restructuring the paper to include all algorithms and experimental results in the main body to conform to standard layout practices.
