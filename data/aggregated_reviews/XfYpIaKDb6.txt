Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of online learning with feedback graphs, focusing on the case of undirected graphs where the feedback structure allows for partial observations. The authors propose an FTRL algorithm with q-Tsallis entropy regularization, achieving an upper bound of $O(\sqrt{\alpha T(1+\ln \frac{K}{\alpha})})$, which interpolates between known bounds for bandit and full-information settings. They also establish an improved lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{\alpha T \frac{\ln K}{\ln \alpha}})$, addressing a logarithmic gap in previous literature. The results extend to time-varying graphs and generalize the analysis of independence numbers.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, and the proposed algorithm is easy to follow.
- It improves upon the best-known $T$-dependent regret bounds for undirected strongly observable graphs.
- The technical contribution, particularly Lemma 1, effectively bounds the stability term of the FTRL algorithm.
- The authors provide a nearly matching lower bound based on a novel reduction to multitask learning.

Weaknesses:
- The current upper bound is limited to undirected strongly observable graphs, with generalization to other graph types remaining unexplored.
- The proofs rely on classical arguments, offering limited original ideas, particularly in the lower bound analysis.
- The algorithm's dependence on the independence number complicates its practical implementation, as approximating this number is computationally challenging.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their results by exploring the application of their techniques to general strongly observable graphs. Additionally, addressing the computational efficiency of the algorithm, particularly regarding the dependence on the independence number, would enhance its practical applicability. Finally, we encourage the authors to investigate whether their analysis can be adapted for fixed graphs, as this could provide further insights into the problem.
