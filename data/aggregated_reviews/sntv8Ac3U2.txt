Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new family of diffusion models, Factor Graph Diffusion Models (FG-DM), aimed at enhancing prompt compliance by modeling the joint distribution of images and conditioning variables through a factor graph. The authors propose an iterative generation method that utilizes a frozen Stable Diffusion (SD) model, allowing for the sequential generation of visual conditions and images. This approach facilitates better control, flexibility, and editing capabilities in image generation. The effectiveness of FG-DM is validated across several datasets, demonstrating improved results over traditional diffusion models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The decomposition of text into various factors, such as segmentation and depth maps, significantly enhances prompt compliance and editing ease.
- The iterative generation method provides strong control and flexibility, supported by classifier-free guidance training.
- The introduction of an Attention Distillation Loss improves the consistency and quality of generated images and conditions.

Weaknesses:
- The sequential generation of intermediate factors increases the time required for image generation.
- The novelty of the method is limited, and comparisons with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods are insufficient, particularly with recent works since 2023.
- Some experimental details and components lack clarity, and there is no qualitative comparison in the ablation study.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental details, explicitly presenting the generation process for each experiment, including Tables 1-5 and Figures 5-7. Additionally, please include comparisons with more recent SOTA methods to justify the effectiveness of FG-DM. It would also be beneficial to demonstrate the framework's applicability to real image editing cases and provide visual results from ablation studies. Finally, we suggest showing generated images using handcrafted conditions rather than solely relying on edited conditions from generated outputs.
