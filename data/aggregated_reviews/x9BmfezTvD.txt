### Key Points
This paper presents an approach to weakly supervised text classification that addresses the limitations of seed word lists for generating pseudo-labels. The authors propose two methods: seed word deletion and random deletion, which aim to mitigate the bias introduced by seed words, thereby enhancing classifier performance. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that these deletion strategies achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, surpassing both seed-based and more sophisticated pseudo-labeling techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well organized and easy to follow.
- It provides a compelling analysis of "debiasing" seed-based pseudo-labeling.
- Experimental results are convincing, showing clear advantages over existing methods.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed method has lower scores than competitors on three out of five datasets.
- The reliance on a single classifier, BERT, raises questions about the generalizability of results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the actual deletion ratios used for the datasets in Table 3. Additionally, it would be beneficial to address the implications of high deletion ratios on long-tail classes and the potential skew in the ratio of punctuation to informative words. Finally, we suggest exploring the performance of different classifiers to assess the robustness of the proposed methods.
