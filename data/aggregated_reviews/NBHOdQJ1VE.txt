### Key Points
This paper presents Adaptive Activation Steering (ACT), a tuning-free method designed to enhance the truthfulness of large language models (LLMs) during inference. ACT adaptively adjusts activation directions using diverse steering vectors to steer LLM outputs towards more truthful responses, addressing various hallucination categories. Experiments conducted on the TruthfulQA benchmark demonstrate significant improvements in truthfulness across multiple models, and the method shows scalability. The authors also validate the effectiveness of ACT through human evaluation and explore its generalization ability on datasets beyond TruthfulQA.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper clearly describes the problem of hallucinations in LLMs and proposes an innovative method to improve truthfulness without requiring model retraining.
2. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of ACT across different datasets and model sizes, showcasing its practical applicability.

Weaknesses:
1. The connection of the work to Web-specific challenges is tenuous, suggesting it may be better suited for NLP conferences rather than Web-focused venues.
2. The experiments primarily rely on the TruthfulQA dataset; additional evaluations on a broader range of datasets are necessary to assess generalizability.
3. The rationale behind chosen evaluation metrics lacks clarity, and comparisons with relevant baselines are insufficient.
4. There are inconsistencies in the definitions of probes, and the choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of clusters in K-means, requires further discussion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the relevance of the work to Web technologies by addressing specific Web challenges. Additionally, conducting experiments on a wider range of datasets, such as RAGTruth and HotpotQA, would strengthen the generalizability claims of ACT. We also suggest providing a clearer rationale for the evaluation metrics used and including comparisons with baselines like ITI. Clarifying the definitions of probes and discussing the selection of hyperparameters in K-means would enhance the technical rigor of the paper. Finally, more details regarding the human evaluation process, including expert qualifications and potential biases, should be included to bolster the credibility of the findings.
