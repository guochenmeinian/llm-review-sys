### Key Points
This paper presents a new inference-time debiasing approach, the Training-free Debiasing Framework (TDF), aimed at mitigating biases in Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC). The authors define causal graphs to model interactions among input utterances, context, and emotion, enabling the identification of biases and the generation of "biased" logits for correction. Experiments across three ERC datasets demonstrate that TDF enhances emotion recognition and fairness compared to numerous baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper offers convincing results and thorough ablation studies, demonstrating the effectiveness of TDF without requiring fine-tuning.  
- The methodology is generalizable beyond ERC, and the comparisons with various state-of-the-art approaches validate its superiority.  
- The framework's originality and practical implications are well-received.

Weaknesses:  
- Readability issues, particularly in Section 3 (especially 3.3 and 3.4), hinder comprehension; specific passages lack clarity and require examples for better understanding.  
- The use of imbalance divergence as a fairness metric is questioned, and the terminology surrounding fairness may not accurately reflect the biases discussed.  
- Some inconsistencies in results presented in Table 2 and unclear notations in Section 3.4 detract from the overall clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the readability of Section 3 by expanding it with examples and clearer descriptions, particularly addressing the following points:  
- Clarify Equation 2, specifically regarding the concatenation of previous utterances and the use of special tokens.  
- Define the term "speaker" in the context of the equations and clarify the role of the \<mask\> token in highlighting emotional states.  
- Provide detailed explanations and examples for constructing neutral and speaker-related word sets in Sections 3.4.2 and 3.4.3.  
- Justify the rationale for including both MELD and EmoryNLP in the analysis, and clarify the terms "replication model" and "baseline model" in Table 2.  
- Address the readability of certain sentences and ensure consistent formatting in table captions.
