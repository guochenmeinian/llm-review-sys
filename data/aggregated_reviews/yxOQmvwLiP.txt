### Key Points
This paper presents a crawler that automates registrations and newsletter subscriptions, extending automated measurements to authenticated websites. The authors analyzed 660,000 websites, uncovering significant security and privacy threats within the EU regulatory framework. Key findings include that 37.2% of websites send marketing emails without proper consent and 1.8% share email addresses with third parties without transparent disclosure. The research highlights compliance violations and underscores the need for improved data protection measures.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and organized, enhancing readability.
- The development of a crawler that effectively evades bot detection and handles multiple languages is a notable contribution, achieving a 90.6% success rate in loading targeted websites.
- The analysis of security threats and privacy violations, particularly regarding consent, represents a substantial contribution to the field.

Weaknesses:
- The testing dataset is relatively small, with only 426 forms for classification and 163 registration forms, which may limit the generalizability of the findings.
- A high rate of unsuccessful interactions (38.4%) on websites is noted, and the authors should explore the reasons behind these failures to strengthen their research.
- The approach to translating email content using LibreTranslate may oversimplify linguistic complexities, potentially leading to inaccuracies in detecting violations.
- The paper lacks a comprehensive analysis of existing studies, which would clarify the advantages of the proposed approach.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the limitations associated with the small size of the testing dataset and its impact on findings. Additionally, the authors should investigate the causes of the high rate of unsuccessful interactions to enhance the robustness of the study. Expanding the error analysis section would provide a more thorough examination of the results. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors utilize advanced text embeddings from large language models instead of TF-IDF features for improved classification accuracy. Lastly, a more detailed comparison with existing studies would strengthen the paper's contributions and clarify its position within the field.
