Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel dataset, the "Multi-pose Anomaly Detection (MAD) dataset," aimed at pose-agnostic anomaly detection in images, featuring over 10,000 images across 20 object categories constructed from LEGO bricks. The dataset includes simulated and real images with pixel-precise ground truth annotations for three types of anomalies: burrs, stains, and missing parts. The authors propose a baseline method, OmniposeAD, based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) for this task, which significantly outperforms ten other anomaly detection methods in benchmarks. The study also explores the correlation between object attributes and method performance. Additionally, the authors introduce a new metric, "Segmentation Pixel-AUROC," for evaluating anomaly detection methods, although concerns about its implementation have been raised. The authors acknowledge limitations in their dataset, particularly regarding the inclusion of only rigid objects and the challenges in capturing the diversity of industrial products.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
1. The introduction of pose-agnostic anomaly detection is a valuable contribution, addressing real-world applications where objects may not appear in fixed poses.
2. The MAD dataset is high-quality and unique, providing a comprehensive resource for benchmarking.
3. The proposed OmniposeAD method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing approaches, showing promising quantitative and qualitative results.
4. The authors have made significant revisions based on reviewer feedback, enhancing clarity and addressing concerns about dataset limitations and metric definitions.
5. The introduction of the "Segmentation Pixel-AUROC" metric aims to provide a more nuanced evaluation of anomaly detection performance.
6. The authors have committed to open-sourcing their code and dataset, promoting reproducibility.

**Weaknesses:**
1. The simulated images are set against a homogeneous white background, which may not reflect real-world conditions.
2. The dataset lacks diversity in object types, as all objects are rigid LEGO constructions with limited texture variation, raising concerns about the generalizability of the conclusions.
3. The limitations of the dataset and the proposed method, OmniposeAD, are not sufficiently discussed.
4. The terminology used for object attributes could be refined for clarity, particularly the definition of color contrast and the rationale behind it, which were initially unclear.
5. The "Segmentation Pixel-AUROC" metric may overlook false negatives outside the bounding boxes, potentially skewing evaluation results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset by incorporating a wider variety of object types to enhance realism and applicability. Additionally, a more detailed discussion of the dataset's limitations is necessary, particularly regarding the challenges of capturing diverse characteristics of industrial products. The authors should clarify the construction of training and test sets to ensure no unintended dataset shifts occur. We suggest refining the terminology for object attributes, specifically replacing "shape" with "structure" while retaining "color." Furthermore, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the dataset construction process and ensure that the definition of color contrast is well-supported by literature references to enhance its credibility. Lastly, we encourage the authors to refine the "Segmentation Pixel-AUROC" metric to address concerns regarding false negatives and its implications for evaluation accuracy, and to correct any inaccuracies in the tables and figures, ensuring that all presented data is accurate and clearly labeled.
