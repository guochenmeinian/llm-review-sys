Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the theoretical identifiability of object-centric representations in object-centric learning (OCL) and discusses the theoretical foundations of slot attention and Transformers. The authors propose a novel method called Probabilistic Slot Attention (PSA), which utilizes a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to generate slots from data samples, relaxing the previous constraint of using only additive decoders. They assert that their theoretical results do not require the decoder additivity constraint if the decoder is piecewise linear and the latent space is GMM distributed. The effectiveness of PSA is demonstrated both theoretically and empirically, with experiments conducted on low-dimensional data, 2D images, and the PascalVOC dataset. The authors aim to address the assumptions necessary for learning identifiable object slots, contributing to the broader representation learning literature.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant problem regarding the assumptions required for learning identifiable object slots.
- It is well-written and structured, making it generally easy to understand.
- The empirical results on common OCL datasets, such as CLEVR and ObjectsRoom, are solid and contribute to the field.
- The proposed framework is an intuitive extension of the vanilla slot attention, resembling the EM algorithm.
- The authors provide a clear theoretical framework that extends the understanding of slot identifiability through probabilistic constraints and piecewise decoders.
- New experiments on PascalVOC effectively address scalability concerns related to probabilistic slot attention.
- The paper demonstrates a thoughtful engagement with reviewer feedback, indicating a willingness to clarify and improve the manuscript.

Weaknesses:
- The claim of being the first to learn identifiable slots with a non-additive decoder lacks empirical support, as PSA-NoA consistently underperforms compared to PSA-Proj and even vanilla SA on various metrics.
- The paper's storyline may misrepresent the contributions, suggesting that probabilistic structure can replace decoder structure, which is not supported by empirical results.
- The experiments primarily focus on simple datasets, lacking validation on more complex models and datasets, which raises concerns about scalability.
- The authors do not sufficiently highlight the piecewise linear structure required for their theoretical results, which may lead to confusion regarding the assumptions made.
- There is a lack of clarity in the criteria used for local matching in the Hungarian algorithm, which could benefit from further elaboration.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical validation of PSA-NoA by testing it against more advanced non-additive decoders, such as the Transformer decoder proposed in [61]. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the theoretical contributions by explicitly discussing the piecewise linear structure required for their results, as this is crucial for contextualizing their work relative to prior studies. We recommend improving the introduction to better emphasize this piecewise linear structure. The authors should also refine the paper's narrative to accurately reflect the complementary roles of probabilistic and decoder structures in achieving identifiability. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to conduct experiments on more complex datasets to better demonstrate the applicability and scalability of their method. Lastly, we recommend providing clearer explanations of the metrics used, particularly the differences between the slot identifiability score (SIS) and the slot MCC (SMCC), and including more details in Appendix F regarding the criteria used for local matching in the Hungarian algorithm. Consider conducting experiments to compare the effectiveness of the matching protocol based on Euclidean distance with other methods, such as slot-wise mask matching or RÂ² score matching.
