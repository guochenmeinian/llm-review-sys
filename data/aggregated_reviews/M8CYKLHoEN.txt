### Key Points
This paper presents the Rank-1 Lattice Targeted Sampling (RLTS) technique aimed at enhancing query efficiency in high-dimensional black-box optimization problems. The authors propose a method that utilizes random rank-1 lattice Quasi-Monte Carlo for fast Gaussian process (GP) training and inference, achieving O(n log n) complexity. Additionally, they derive a closed-form construction for efficient rank-1 lattice sampling. The paper addresses the challenges of high-dimensional optimization and aims to improve the performance of Quasi-Monte Carlo methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The authors tackle a significant issue in high-dimensional optimization, providing a novel sampling method that reduces time complexity and enhances scalability. The theoretical analysis demonstrates the error pattern of the rank-1 lattice construction, and empirical evaluations validate the method's effectiveness against other approaches.

Weaknesses:  
The paper lacks cohesion and clarity in presenting technical details, particularly regarding lattice methods and low-discrepancy sequences. Important concepts, such as the initial set of points and input box boundaries, are insufficiently discussed. There is also a lack of thorough comparisons with existing Bayesian optimization methods, leaving the competitive advantages of RLTS unclear. Furthermore, the experimental setup details are inadequate, raising questions about parameter selection and GP training specifics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and cohesion of the paper by providing more comprehensive discussions on lattice methods and low-discrepancy sequences. It is essential to explicitly explain the advantages of the rank-1 lattice approach to enhance reader understanding. Additionally, the authors should clarify how initial points are obtained and provide details on the data acquisition process. A thorough comparison with existing Bayesian optimization techniques is necessary to articulate the unique features of RLTS. Finally, including detailed experimental setup information and performance plots would substantiate claims of accelerated methods.
