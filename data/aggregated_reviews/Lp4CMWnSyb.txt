### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework, CausalGF, for the cross-domain few-shot relation extraction (RE) task, grounded in a structural causal model. The authors analyze data bias and the influence of various factors from a causal perspective, demonstrating that CausalGF outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets. The framework provides a theoretical basis for feature selection and fusion, supported by experimental results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The causal perspective effectively addresses the domain gap in cross-domain RE tasks.  
- The theoretical proof elaborates the method's foundation, contributing to its novelty.  
- Significant improvements over baseline models are reported, indicating the method's effectiveness.  

Weaknesses:  
- The motivation behind graph topology selection is insufficiently presented.  
- Some content in the appendix should be integrated into the main text for clarity.  
- A lack of necessary case studies and detailed experimental settings, including hyperparameters and data preprocessing, limits the paper's comprehensiveness.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the graph topology selection by addressing the alternative graph structure and its implications on causal effects. Additionally, we suggest integrating relevant appendix content into the main text to enhance conciseness. Providing a case study to illustrate the method's effectiveness and detailing the experimental settings would strengthen the paper significantly.
