Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents PLM4ViSMT, the first monolingual pre-trained language model specifically designed for Vietnamese social media texts, based on the XLM-R architecture. The authors conduct extensive experiments on five significant natural language tasks, including emotion identification, hate speech detection, sentiment analysis, spam review detection, and hate speech segment identification. They demonstrate that PLM4ViSMT outperforms existing models tailored for Vietnamese language processing.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a dedicated PLM for Vietnamese social media text processing is a significant contribution.
- The model achieves state-of-the-art results in multiple downstream tasks, showcasing its effectiveness.
- Detailed ablation studies highlight the importance of various model components, such as emoji handling.

Weaknesses:
- Insufficient details on the identification and collection of Vietnamese social media texts.
- Lack of information regarding the training behavior and whether results were based on single or multiple runs.
- The paper does not compare the proposed model with other language models specifically trained for social media tasks, which would provide better benchmarks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the data collection process for Vietnamese social media texts. Additionally, providing details on the training behavior and results computation methodology would enhance the reproducibility of the study. The authors should also consider comparing their model with other multilingual pre-trained models, such as BERNICE, to establish more robust benchmarks. Finally, addressing the potential for continued pre-training of existing models on the newly collected data could yield better results.
