Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the performative power of online search engines, specifically examining how the arrangement of search results influences web traffic. The authors propose a framework to measure performative power through a browser extension that modifies search results and logs user click behavior. The study collects data from over 80 participants, revealing significant findings, such as a 42% reduction in clicks on Google when the top search result is downranked by one position. Additionally, the paper analyzes the performative power of ranking updates in the context of the Google Shopping case, focusing on measuring the effects of specific interventions rather than designing fairer rankings or debiasing click data. The authors emphasize the need for empirical evidence and clarify that their approach is retrospective, assessing the effects of changes already implemented by platforms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors introduce a novel concept of performative power, contributing significantly to digital platform policy.
- The study is well-designed, with robust quantitative findings supported by extensive data collection.
- Clarity is high, with clear definitions and methodology.
- The authors effectively clarify their focus on measuring specific interventions and their impacts, distinguishing their work from existing literature that aims to debias or optimize rankings.
- The retrospective application of performative power provides a clear framework for understanding the effects of ranking changes.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a reference to the source code for the browser extension, limiting ongoing work.
- The novelty of the contribution is unclear, as the performative power measure and its relevance in regulation stem from prior work.
- The paper does not sufficiently address the sustainability of interventions and their implications for user behavior and platform competition.
- The concept of user experience quality change is not adequately discussed, which could lead to misunderstandings about the implications of ranking adjustments.
- Ambiguities in the related work section may confuse readers regarding the distinctions between their approach and other methodologies.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including a reference to the source code for the browser extension to support ongoing research. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the novelty of their contribution, particularly in relation to existing literature on performative power and click behavior. It is crucial to discuss the sustainability of the interventions used in the study, considering how user behavior may change over time and the implications for platform competition. Furthermore, we recommend enhancing the discussion surrounding the concept of change in user experience quality, particularly in relation to competitive dynamics among providers. Please clarify in the final version that performative power is applied retrospectively to avoid misinterpretations. Lastly, explicitly differentiating between methods requiring platform control and those relying on observational data in the related work section would be beneficial.
