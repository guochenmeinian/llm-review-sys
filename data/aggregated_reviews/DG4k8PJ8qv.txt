### Key Points
This paper presents POGEMA, a Partially-Observable Grid Environment for Multiple Agents, designed for the multi-agent pathfinding task. POGEMA, developed in Python, offers a gym-like interface and includes six distinct domain types, facilitating the evaluation of various well-known multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods. The significance of POGEMA lies in its provision of a standard training environment for Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF), addressing the lack of open-source environments for comparative research. The evaluation results indicate that established MARL methods, such as VDN and QMIX, perform poorly in this environment. Additionally, the paper introduces an ingestion script that converts MovingAI maps for compatibility with POGEMA, allowing users to download and save maps in a YAML format. The authors provide a detailed hyperparameter sweep for various MARL algorithms, reporting performance metrics across different models and their tuned versions, indicating significant improvements in performance, cooperation, and pathfinding after tuning. The authors also address the issue of reward sparsity in MARL algorithms, proposing to implement dense reward functions from established MAPF algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- POGEMA provides a standard RL training environment for MAPF, which is significant for both MAPF and MARL communities.
- The suite includes a straightforward API, customizable environments, and integrated state-of-the-art baselines for various multi-agent planners.
- The ingestion script for MovingAI maps is straightforward and well-documented, facilitating ease of use.
- Comprehensive hyperparameter tuning results are provided, showcasing improvements in key performance metrics.
- The authors demonstrate responsiveness to reviewer feedback regarding reward functions, indicating a commitment to enhancing the model.

Weaknesses:
- The fixed number of agents in each environment limits user flexibility.
- Certain environments lack detailed explanations, hindering reader comprehension.
- The default reward structure is overly sparse, potentially affecting RL algorithm training.
- The reliance on sparse rewards is a concern, as it may limit the effectiveness of the algorithms compared to those utilizing dense rewards.
- The performance of MARL approaches remains inferior when compared to other algorithms, indicating room for improvement.
- The training process for evaluated methods lacks parameter sweeps, which are crucial for performance optimization.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve user flexibility by allowing customization of the number of agents in each environment. Additionally, please provide more detailed explanations for the MovingAI, MovingAI-tiles, and Puzzles environments to enhance understanding. Incorporating additional environments from the MAPF benchmark suite would also be beneficial. Furthermore, we suggest conducting a parameter sweep for the evaluated algorithms to optimize performance and reconsider the reward structure to avoid sparsity. We encourage the authors to improve the reward structure by incorporating dense reward designs, as seen in other RL MAPF papers like PRIML, DHC, and DCC. Lastly, we recommend implementing a list of wrappers for popular learnable MAPF algorithms to enhance the reward function options available in their framework and clarify the definitions of performance metrics to ensure that the claims regarding algorithm performance are accurately represented in the results.
