### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of honesty alignment in AI models, focusing on the formulation of the honesty alignment problem and the development of evaluation metrics to assess model honesty. The authors propose various training methods aimed at enhancing model honesty, including the introduction of specific metrics such as the prudence score, over-conservativeness score, and honesty score. The effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated through experiments, which also examine the generalizability of the proposed techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a significant research topic, providing a clear and logical definition of the honesty alignment problem, which is currently lacking in the community.
2. The proposed methods effectively improve model honesty, and their descriptions are clear and concise.
3. The paper introduces insightful evaluation metrics that contrast model behavior pre- and post-alignment, offering a comprehensive view of honesty adherence.

Weaknesses:
1. The methods are heavily based on human heuristics, limiting their novelty, and some rely on threshold selection, which may not be robust.
2. There is a lack of comparability at the method level, with insufficient analysis of why certain methods work, such as the impact of training sample numbers and the rationale behind confidence scores.
3. The paper does not compare with several important baselines, limiting its contextual understanding and applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their methods by exploring additional hyperparameters related to model behavior and honesty dynamics during the alignment process. Additionally, we suggest including a Limitations & Social Impacts section to comply with the NIPS Checklist. To enhance the robustness of their findings, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of how the uncertainty score prefix influences model behavior and internal representations. Finally, we encourage the authors to conduct experiments verifying the impact of increased honesty on harmlessness and analyze the accuracy of the uncertainty expressions learned by the final model.
