### Key Points
This paper presents a method for solving Functional Differential Equations (FDEs) using neural networks, specifically through the application of Cylindrical Approximation to convert FDEs into higher-dimensional Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) for resolution via Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The authors aim to address the computational challenges associated with FDEs, which are less studied compared to PDEs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The approach provides a novel solution to longstanding numerical issues in computing FDEs, making them more accessible for computation.  
2. The use of cylindrical approximations significantly enhances computational complexity and expressive power, with clear notation and presentation.  
3. The topic is intriguing and relevant, with specific examples and mathematical explanations provided.

Weaknesses:  
1. The theoretical foundation is weak, primarily presenting asymptotic results without addressing the main issues effectively.  
2. The experimental section lacks clarity, particularly in Figures 4 and 7, which suffer from poor readability.  
3. There is insufficient comparison with existing numerical methods, which is essential to demonstrate the proposed method's advantages.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical part by addressing the main issues more directly and providing a clearer discussion on the approximation rates of both Cylindrical Approximation and PINNs. Additionally, enhancing the experimental section by improving the readability of Figures 4 and 7 and including comparisons with existing numerical methods like CP-ALS would clarify the proposed method's effectiveness. We also suggest moving critical information from the appendix to the main text to strengthen the paper's overall clarity and impact.
