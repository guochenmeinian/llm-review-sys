### Key Points
This paper presents UniMath, a multimodal mathematical problem-solving model capable of addressing arithmetic, geometry, and table-based math problems. The authors propose a framework that unifies various math-related generation tasks into a T5-based transformer encoder-decoder architecture, leveraging pretrained models and joint training across different modalities. The experimental results indicate that UniMath outperforms baselines trained on individual tasks and can transfer to held-out math-related tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research question is meaningful, addressing the need for a model that can handle diverse formats and modalities in math-related tasks.
- The approach is straightforward, utilizing a seq-to-seq paradigm with appropriate encoders for each modality.
- Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of joint training, showing promise for both held-in and held-out tasks.
- Comprehensive analysis of implementation details is provided.

Weaknesses:
- Comparisons with existing works are confusing and may misrepresent prior results, particularly regarding GeoQA and TableMWP.
- Technical details about model architecture, parameter size, and training processes are insufficiently detailed.
- More case studies are needed to substantiate the effectiveness of the UniMath framework.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their comparisons with existing works, ensuring that all relevant results are accurately reported in the main results table. Additionally, the authors should provide more comprehensive technical details regarding the model architecture and training processes to enhance reproducibility. It would also be beneficial to include more case studies demonstrating the effectiveness of UniMath in facilitating math reasoning through joint training. Finally, we suggest that the authors tone down claims of state-of-the-art performance in the abstract and introduction to align with the actual results reported.
