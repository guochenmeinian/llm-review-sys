Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for illumination-aware conditional image repainting (LumiAIRe), which integrates environmental lighting estimation, 3D normal estimation, and illumination injection to achieve harmonized lighting effects in both foreground and background regions. The authors propose a new dataset, CAR-LumiAIRe, comprising 52,581 composited images from 198 detailed 3D car models and 1,321 background images to validate their method. The results demonstrate convincing performance, particularly in shadow generation and foreground illumination. Additionally, the authors introduce a method for lighting-realistic generation and perception with user-controlled semantics in image editing. They acknowledge the limitations of their generated cars compared to real cars, emphasizing that while details are important for dedicated car simulation tasks, they are not the primary focus of their contribution. The authors highlight the critical difference between their approach and related works, noting that their method generates the foreground object in accordance with the semantics provided by parsing masks and attributes, rather than relying on pre-existing images. Preliminary comparisons indicate that the reshading method struggles with background integration and lighting consistency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of physical information into vision tasks is a promising direction, and the incorporation of lighting and 3D geometric information is both interesting and sound.
- The repainted car images exhibit more plausible lighting effects compared to previous methods.
- The problem formulation is clear and consistent with the equations presented, making it easy to follow.
- The dataset creation process is well-defined, with careful specification of insertion points for physical plausibility.
- The authors clearly articulate the unique contributions of their method in lighting-realistic generation.
- They provide preliminary results demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach in handling lighting conditions.

Weaknesses:
- The variation in car shapes is limited, potentially restricting the method's generalization capacity.
- The CAR-LumiAIRe dataset is rendered at a resolution of 256x256, which may not suffice for high-resolution tasks.
- The paper lacks comparisons with relevant prior works and does not adequately address the impact of occlusion on illumination estimation.
- The evaluation of shadow quality is insufficient, and the variety of foreground objects is limited, which may affect the method's robustness.
- The generated cars lack detail compared to real counterparts, which may limit applicability in certain tasks.
- The comparison with related methods may be perceived as unfair due to fundamental differences in approach.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the variety of shapes in the dataset to enhance generalization capabilities. Additionally, increasing the resolution of the CAR-LumiAIRe dataset would better support high-resolution tasks. The authors should also address the limitations of their lighting representation by comparing it with prior works and conducting a thorough statistical analysis of the dataset. Clarifying the evaluation of shadow quality and expanding the range of foreground objects would strengthen the paper. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related works and include more experimental results, such as separated evaluations, additional ablations, and comparisons with relevant single image editing works. We also suggest that the authors clarify the limitations of their method regarding detail generation and address the potential implications for dedicated car simulation tasks. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide further evaluation results on the lighting rotation application to validate their findings comprehensively.
