### Key Points
This paper presents PivotFEC, a method for improving factual error correction (FEC) through a novel pivot task called factual error injection, utilizing large language models (LLMs) for few-shot learning to generate paired data. The authors claim that their method outperforms existing distantly supervised models on the FECDATA dataset, achieving new state-of-the-art results. The paper is well-structured, with reasonable evaluations and necessary baselines included in the experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed pipeline is easy to understand and clearly written.
- The experiments are thorough, including human evaluations that demonstrate the method's strengths and weaknesses.
- The approach achieves state-of-the-art results in the factual error correction task.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the proposed method is questioned, as it does not significantly differ from previous methods for generating synthetic data, such as mask infilling or entity substitution.
- Concerns are raised regarding the quality of the evaluation dataset, as the errors it contains may not reflect the types of mistakes made by recent models, particularly LLMs.
- There is uncertainty about the reliability of using LLMs like ChatGPT for generating false claims, given their potential for noise and variability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty aspect by providing clearer evidence of how LLMs enhance the generation of synthetic false claims compared to traditional methods. Additionally, we suggest that the authors conduct experiments with datasets that include more representative errors made by recent models, rather than relying on obvious errors. A qualitative analysis of the reliability of LLMs, particularly ChatGPT, in generating synthetic data would also strengthen the paper. Finally, we encourage the authors to manually verify the generated instances to assess their fluency and specificity, as suggested by T+V 2021, and to compare their work with relevant literature, such as Cao et al. 2020, to contextualize their contributions.
