Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an algorithm for active representation learning in multi-task settings, accommodating both discrete and continuous task spaces. The authors propose a framework that enables optimal selection of source tasks, utilizing a three-stage process: coarse sampling, target-agnostic sampling, and target-aware sampling. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that under certain assumptions, the active approach can achieve improved sample complexity compared to passive methods. The authors validate their framework through experiments on simulated robotic tasks, showing that their method outperforms existing strategies in terms of sample efficiency and generalization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel framework for active representation learning, effectively addressing an important problem in multi-task learning.
- The theoretical analysis is thorough, providing sample complexity bounds and convergence guarantees.
- Empirical results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness across various scenarios, particularly in robotics.

Weaknesses:
- The paper is difficult to parse, with many assumptions made in the preliminaries that may undermine the significance of the approach.
- The experimental setup lacks comprehensive comparisons to relevant baselines, particularly regarding the performance of the proposed method against other active learning strategies.
- The motivation and significance of the problem statement are not clearly articulated, particularly concerning its applicability beyond simulated environments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by simplifying the notation and providing more context for the assumptions made in the preliminaries. Additionally, a more thorough comparative analysis with existing literature on multi-task learning and task-relatedness would enhance the paper's contribution. It would also be beneficial to include empirical assessments on real-world tasks to validate the proposed method's applicability. Finally, we suggest that the authors explicitly discuss the limitations of their approach, particularly regarding the assumptions about task space and distribution.
