Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on Concave Utility Reinforcement Learning (CURL) in non-stationary environments, proposing the MetaCURL algorithm to address challenges posed by non-stationary Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with changing losses and transition probabilities. The algorithm aggregates multiple black-box algorithm instances and achieves optimal dynamic regret without prior knowledge of MDP changes, which is a significant advancement in the RL community. Additionally, the paper introduces a theoretical framework for learning with expert advice, particularly in scenarios where the number of experts $K$ equals the number of episodes $T$. The authors assert that their algorithm does not require prior knowledge of environmental changes, which they argue is a significant contribution to the field. They also aim to address challenges in robotics and finance, proposing a meta-algorithm designed to manage a variable number of experts and handle complex scenarios, including infinite horizons and high-frequency trading.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The algorithm is parameter-free and does not require knowledge of the variation budget of transitions.
- The theoretical results and proofs are solid and well-constructed, particularly regarding regret analysis.
- The paper contributes to the theoretical understanding of non-stationary learning in reinforcement learning.
- The authors clarify complex concepts, such as the loop-free terminology and the role of experts in the algorithm.
- The acknowledgment of the complexity of the CURL framework compared to classical RL highlights its significance.
- The paper addresses interesting applications in robotics and finance, with potential for real-world impact.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks motivation for the combination of CURL and non-stationarity, failing to justify its significance or the novelty of the proposed algorithm and analysis.
- The assumption that $K = T$ and the optimality of experts may limit the practical applicability of the algorithm.
- There are restrictive assumptions, such as the independence of stochastic transitions from actions, which limit exploration.
- The lack of empirical validation raises concerns about the real-world relevance of the theoretical claims.
- The presentation is difficult to follow due to inconsistent notations and a lack of introductory examples or figures.
- The clarity of notation and definitions is lacking, making it difficult to evaluate the theoretical contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for studying non-stationarity in CURL by clearly articulating its relevance and potential applications. Additionally, the authors should clarify how the algorithm accommodates variability among experts, particularly when some are not optimal. We suggest including numerical examples or visual figures to illustrate real-world applications, which would strengthen the paper's practical relevance. Furthermore, addressing the inconsistencies in notation and terminology throughout the paper would enhance clarity. We encourage the authors to explore the implications of their restrictive assumptions and consider incorporating related works to strengthen the context of their contributions. Finally, it is important to explicitly state the objective functions in various contexts, such as finance and inventory management, to strengthen the alignment of their examples with the proposed framework.
