Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to enhancing the diversity of particles in Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) by introducing hyperspherical energy (HE) as an objective. The authors claim that this method can circumvent the permutation invariance issues found in traditional diversity metrics. Additionally, the paper explores the integration of Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Minimization of Hyperspherical Energy (MHE) to improve uncertainty quantification in both synthetic and real-world tasks. The contributions include proposing CKA as an optimization objective and utilizing MHE to mitigate diminishing gradient issues, leading to improved performance in uncertainty estimation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses the important issue of particle diversity in BNNs and introduces a fresh perspective by combining CKA and MHE.
- Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in uncertainty quantification across various tasks, showcasing practical effectiveness.
- The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations and effective illustrations of performance improvements.

Weaknesses:  
- The technical contribution is limited, primarily adding a new regularization term to the standard ensemble framework without significant innovation compared to prior works.
- Evaluations are restricted to synthetic data and small datasets, raising concerns about scalability and generalizability.
- Important ablation studies are missing, particularly regarding different model architectures and the number of particles.
- Comparisons in OOD detection performance may be biased due to the use of generated OOD samples, and the datasets employed are relatively simple and outdated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the technical contribution by providing more substantial innovations beyond the new regularization term. It would be beneficial to conduct additional experiments on larger and more diverse datasets, such as ImageNet, to better assess the practical effectiveness of the proposed methods. We also suggest including important ablation studies to explore the impact of different model architectures and particle numbers. Furthermore, addressing the potential biases in OOD detection comparisons and clarifying the experimental setup would strengthen the paper's findings.
