### Key Points
This paper presents a serverless system called ÔÅ¨Grapher for GNN serving that enhances resource efficiency through graph sharing and fine-grained resource allocation. The authors propose a graph-centric scheduling approach and adaptive timeout for request buffering, addressing challenges in GNN serving. The empirical analysis demonstrates significant resource savings and improved performance compared to existing systems. The paper's structure is clear, logically presenting the problem, solution, evaluation, and related work.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is grounded in extensive empirical analysis and presents a systematic approach to GNN serving challenges.
- The originality of leveraging data locality in serverless computing for GNNs is notable, contributing to resource efficiency.
- The proposed methods show significant improvements in memory and computing resource efficiency, with a coherent presentation that aids reader comprehension.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks discussion on potential barriers to adoption, such as adjustments needed in existing serverless architectures.
- There is insufficient evaluation of the overhead associated with graph sharing and its impact on computation time.
- Minor typos and grammar errors are present, and the discussion of existing serverless Graph Systems in Section 5 is limited.
- The relationship between data locality and graph sharing is not clearly articulated, leading to confusion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on potential barriers to adoption, particularly regarding adjustments to existing serverless architectures. Additionally, the authors should provide a detailed analysis of the overhead associated with graph sharing and its impact on computation time. Clarifying the relationship between data locality and graph sharing will enhance understanding. Finally, addressing minor typos and grammar errors will improve the overall quality of the paper.
