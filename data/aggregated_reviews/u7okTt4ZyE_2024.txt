Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Domain Shift diffusion-based super-resolution model, named DoSSR, which enhances efficiency by initiating the diffusion process with low-resolution images. The authors introduce a continuous formulation of the domain shift process using stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and develop customized fast samplers, achieving state-of-the-art efficiency. The proposed method is evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating competitive results in various perceptual quality measurements.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The DoSSR model achieves remarkable speedup in inference, showcasing superior efficiency.  
2. The method demonstrates competitive performance on non-reference metrics across multiple benchmark datasets.  
3. The paper is well-organized, with clear figures and a solid theoretical foundation, including thorough formula derivations.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The novelty of the Domain Shift scheme is questionable, as it appears similar to existing methods like ResShift. Further clarification on its uniqueness is needed.  
2. The experimental settings are insufficient, lacking comparisons with baseline methods such as "RealESRGAN preprocessing + DiffBIR" and "RealESRGAN preprocessing + w/o Domain Shift Guidance (DoSG)."  
3. The paper does not adequately illustrate the overall structure of the adopted models, making it difficult to understand how corrupted inputs are utilized as conditional information.  
4. Performance improvements on several datasets are limited, and visual comparisons are hindered by the absence of ground truth images.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the novelty of the Domain Shift scheme and provide a detailed comparison with existing methods. It would be beneficial to include experiments verifying the performance of the proposed method against baseline models. Additionally, we suggest illustrating the overall structure of the adopted models to clarify how corrupted inputs serve as conditional information. Finally, we encourage the authors to conduct experiments to justify the interpolation approach between low-resolution and high-resolution images, addressing potential concerns regarding the training methodology.
