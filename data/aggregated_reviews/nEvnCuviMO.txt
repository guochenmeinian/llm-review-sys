### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of the metric distortion framework to evaluate social choice rules under probabilistic voting scenarios, where voters' preferences are influenced by a probability distribution based on distances in a metric space. The authors propose three axioms—*scale-freeness*, *independence of other candidates*, and *strict monotonicity*—that govern the induced marginal probabilities of voter preferences. They derive upper and lower bounds for the distortion of the *Plurality* rule and provide upper bounds for the *Copeland* and *Random Dictator* rules, highlighting the implications of noise in voting.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The model introduced is a significant generalization of previous work, offering a novel perspective on social choice rules, particularly in the context of noisy inputs. The analysis is thorough, with matching asymptotic bounds for the *Plurality* rule and comprehensive results for *Copeland* and *Random Dictator*. The paper is well-written and presents a clear contribution to the field.

Weaknesses:  
Concerns arise regarding Lemma 3, particularly the equivalence of constraints in the proof, which lacks clarity. The upper bound for *Copeland* is noted to be loose, and the paper's fit for NeurIPS is questioned, suggesting it may be more appropriate for conferences focused on algorithms or social choice theory. Additionally, the presentation could be improved, with formal notation introduced earlier and clearer motivations for the axioms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Lemma 3's proof, particularly regarding the equivalence of constraints. It would be beneficial to provide insight into why the *Copeland* upper bound is not tight. We also suggest enhancing the presentation by introducing formal notation and definitions earlier in the paper, particularly in Section 1.1, to facilitate understanding. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the motivations for Axiom 2 and consider analyzing additional voting rules beyond the three currently discussed to strengthen the paper's contribution.
