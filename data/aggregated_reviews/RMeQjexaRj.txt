Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Elastic Decision Transformer (EDT), which enhances the Decision Transformer (DT) by dynamically adjusting the history length during inference to improve trajectory stitching. EDT maintains longer histories for optimal trajectories and shorter ones for sub-optimal ones, allowing for better performance in generating high-return trajectories. Empirical results demonstrate that EDT outperforms the original DT and certain Q-Learning methods across various D4RL tasks and Atari games.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well presented and easy to follow.
- The novel approach of dynamically adjusting history length is well-motivated and effectively addresses trajectory stitching.
- Empirical results indicate that EDT is robust and performs well across multiple benchmarks.
- Code is submitted, enhancing reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- The applicability of EDT is limited to DT and its variants, with insufficient exploration of other state-of-the-art methods.
- Key comparisons with recent diffusion-based methods, such as Diffuser and Decision Diffuser, are missing.
- The performance of EDT heavily relies on the value maximizer, which may affect training efficiency.
- The paper lacks clarity in explaining the mechanics of the value maximizer and expectile regression.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion by including comparative analyses with other state-of-the-art DT variants, such as Prompt DT, Hyper DT, and Multi-Game DT. Additionally, exploring ways to enhance the training speed of the value maximizer would be beneficial. A more detailed explanation of the expectile regression mechanics should be included to aid reader understanding. Furthermore, we suggest conducting experiments in non-Markovian environments to validate the model's robustness and addressing the clarity issues regarding the definitions of returns and losses. Lastly, correcting the typo on line 234 from "Figure 2" to "Table 2" is necessary.
