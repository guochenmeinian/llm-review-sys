### Key Points
This paper presents a novel federated recommendation framework called user-governed data contribution federated recommendation (UGFedRec), allowing users to control their data sharing with the server. The authors propose the CDCGNNFed model, which integrates local training on user-centric ego graphs with server-side training on higher-order graphs, utilizing contrastive learning and a graph mending strategy. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, particularly in enhancing recommendation quality while addressing privacy concerns.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The concept of user-governed data contribution is innovative and offers a fresh perspective on privacy management in federated recommendation systems.
2. The CDCGNNFed method effectively leverages graph mending and contrastive learning to tackle data sparsity and non-uniform distribution challenges.
3. Comprehensive experiments validate the proposed method's effectiveness compared to existing approaches.

Weaknesses:
1. Some experimental setups are confusing, particularly regarding the top-k experiments with partial uploading and the sampling methods used.
2. The paper lacks clarity in certain technical aspects, such as the details of graph mending and the consistency of notation in equations.
3. The assumption of active user participation in data governance may not hold true universally, potentially limiting the model's applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of experimental setups, particularly regarding the top-k experiments and the sampling methods used. Additionally, more technical details about graph mending should be provided, including whether the GNN-BASED node encoder is pre-trained or updated during training. We suggest using consistent notation throughout the paper, especially for the regularization coefficients in Equations (7) and (8). Furthermore, the authors should discuss the applicability of their framework to other recommendation methods, such as matrix factorization, and consider enriching the related work section with more references on controllable privacy in recommender systems. Lastly, we encourage the authors to enhance the presentation of the algorithm by formally outlining the steps and using clear mathematical notation.
