Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of selective mixup techniques, concluding that the improvements attributed to these techniques can largely be explained by the resampling procedure rather than the mixing strategy itself. The authors propose that selective mixup benefits from a resampling effect that balances class and domain distributions, enhancing model performance. They provide theoretical insights and extensive experimental validation across various datasets and algorithms, confirming their perspective on selective mixup.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a novel understanding of selective mixup, emphasizing the resampling effect over traditional mixing.
- Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and algorithms are conducted, providing a thorough investigation of sampling criteria.
- The observations regarding the roles of resampling and regression to the mean are particularly interesting.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution to the body of knowledge is perceived as limited, particularly in the context of two-class problems where selective mixup leads to uniform distribution.
- The analysis lacks robust theoretical backing, with insufficient exploration of how the mixing operation itself influences selective mixup.
- The paper's presentation is criticized for formatting issues, including short paragraphs and misplaced captions, which detract from professionalism.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical foundation of their work by providing more evidence on how selective mixup affects covariate distribution and the role of the mixing operation. Additionally, we suggest that the authors carefully determine the hyperparameters of the Beta distribution used in Mixup to ensure fair comparisons with other methods. It would also be beneficial to include overall performance metrics alongside worst-group performance to provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Lastly, addressing formatting issues will enhance the paper's readability and professionalism.
