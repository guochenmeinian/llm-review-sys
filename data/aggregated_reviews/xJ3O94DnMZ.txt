### Key Points
This paper presents a two-stage framework called Self-Attribution and Decision-Making (SADM) to address the problem of loosely linked model-generated rationales to predictions. The authors propose that the model first extracts rationales and then utilizes them for decision-making, employing strategies such as reasoning augment learning (RAL) and sentence mark (SM) to enhance performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SADM across various datasets in the ERASER benchmark.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper addresses an important issue regarding the reliability of the link between rationales and model predictions.  
2. The proposed SADM method shows effectiveness in experiments, achieving state-of-the-art results.  
3. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:  
1. The novelty of the proposed method is unclear, as it resembles existing frameworks and lacks comprehensive comparisons with relevant baseline methods.  
2. The analysis of the problem is primarily qualitative, lacking statistical evaluation of the unreliable link issue.  
3. The method section could benefit from clearer explanations and background information on previous techniques.  
4. There is a lack of citations in Section 2.2, and human evaluations on generated rationales are absent.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method section by including background information on previous techniques such as SM and RAL, and explicitly formulate the objectives. Additionally, we suggest conducting a statistical analysis of the proportion of the unreliable link problem and clarifying how many issues SADM addresses. To enhance the paper's contribution, it is crucial to highlight the unique aspects of SADM compared to existing approaches and include comparisons with relevant baseline methods. Finally, incorporating human evaluations on the generated rationales would strengthen the findings.
