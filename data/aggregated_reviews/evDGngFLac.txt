### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for neurosymbolic learning that enhances the training of an embedding model for logical inference tasks. The authors propose an innovative approach called 'anchor mutation,' where triplets (anchor, positive, negative) are generated to train the model. The embedding model learns to position unifying atoms (anchor and positive) closer together in the embedding space while distancing non-unifying atoms (anchor and negative). The paper evaluates the quality of these embeddings to ensure they accurately model original semantics and improves reasoning through a downstream scoring function.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- Well-motivated task  
- Clearly presented algorithm  

Weaknesses:  
- A more formal definition of repeated term atoms (RTAs) is needed, along with a discussion of their impact on downstream tasks.  
- Additional explanations regarding Table 2 are required. Specifically, clarification on how the new embedding strategy differs from previous embeddings is necessary. It should be addressed whether the new embeddings only improve the mean nodes metric in large knowledge bases while remaining unchanged in the median metric, and if performance could potentially decline in larger knowledge bases concerning the medium nodes explored metric.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the formal definition of repeated term atoms (RTAs) and elaborate on their effects on downstream tasks. Additionally, we suggest providing more detailed explanations for Table 2, particularly regarding the differences between the new and previous embedding strategies and the implications of performance metrics in larger knowledge bases.
