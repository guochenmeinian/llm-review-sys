Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Multimodal Lego (MM-Lego), a framework designed to merge unimodal encoders into a competitive multimodal model with minimal or no fine-tuning. The authors address challenges in multimodal learning, particularly in biomedical tasks, by utilizing frequency-domain representations to handle different distributions and scales of data. The method demonstrates strong performance across seven medical datasets and allows for the merging of models without requiring paired data, which is a significant advancement in the field.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The framework's innovative use of frequency-domain learning effectively mitigates signal interference.
- MM-Lego is flexible, allowing for the combination of various unimodal encoders without retraining.
- Comprehensive evaluation on multiple datasets showcases the method's versatility and strong performance.

Weaknesses:
- The mathematical formalism, particularly regarding Fourier transforms, lacks clarity, which may hinder understanding for readers unfamiliar with the topic.
- Limited comparisons with advanced multimodal models reduce the impact of the findings.
- The motivation for iterative updates within the Lego Blocks is not fully explained, and the computational costs associated with these iterations are not discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the mathematical explanations, especially regarding the transformation between spatial and frequency domains. Additionally, consider including more comparisons with state-of-the-art multimodal models to enhance the evaluation of the framework's advantages. Clarifying the motivation behind the iterative updates and discussing the computational overhead associated with these iterations would strengthen the paper. Finally, including ablation studies on key design choices and exploring datasets from non-medical domains could broaden the framework's applicability and generalizability.
