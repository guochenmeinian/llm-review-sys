### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to complex query answering in knowledge graphs (KGs) by extending traditional tree-form queries to Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) queries. The authors propose a new relational combinator that enhances query embeddings, allowing for more expressive queries aligned with ALCOIR description logic. The paper introduces three new benchmarking datasets and demonstrates that the proposed method, DAGE, significantly improves performance on DAG queries compared to existing models like Query2Box and BetaE.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a new scenario for KG complex query answering, potentially broadening the research field.
- The internal mechanism of DAGE is well-explained, supported by theoretical proofs and experimental validation.
- The creation of new datasets for evaluating DAG queries is a valuable contribution.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for using DAG queries is unclear, lacking a thorough analysis of their advantages over tree-format queries.
- There is insufficient comparison with relevant public benchmarks and recent methods, such as GNN-QE, LMPNN, and QTO.
- The paper does not address the computational overhead introduced by the relational combinator or provide an error analysis of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation analysis in the introduction to clearly articulate the advantages of DAG queries over tree-format queries, including the limitations of existing methods. Additionally, the authors should include comparisons with relevant query types from public benchmarks and recent methodologies to strengthen their claims. It would also be beneficial to discuss the computational costs associated with DAGE, particularly in large-scale applications, and to provide an error analysis to identify limitations and future directions for the research.
