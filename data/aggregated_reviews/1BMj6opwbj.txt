### Key Points
This paper presents a method for injecting human values into large language models (LLMs) to predict opinions and behaviors. The authors propose a Value Injection Method (VIM) that utilizes argument generation and question answering through LORA fine-tuning, leveraging the Touch√©23-ValueEval dataset. The experimental results indicate that the value-injected model, ViLLaMA, outperforms baseline models, including LLaMA and ChatGPT, across various tasks related to personality evaluation and argument generation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and clear.
- The topic is interesting and timely, with extensive experiments demonstrating the method's efficacy.
- The experimental setting is sound, and the results are convincing.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the paper is limited, primarily relying on established fine-tuning techniques without introducing novel methods.
- There are concerns regarding the performance of the VILLAMAag model compared to baselines.
- The paper lacks significance tests for the experimental results and does not provide hyper-parameter details for the LLMs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Algorithm 5, line 5, by adding that \( V_g = \{v_g^z\} \) in line 2 for better connection. Additionally, in Algorithm 2, line 4, clarify the discretization process mentioned. We suggest conducting significance tests to further verify the effectiveness of VIM and including hyper-parameter settings for the LLMs. More in-depth analysis of the VILLAMAag model's performance is needed, particularly regarding its comparison with baselines. Lastly, we urge the authors to expand the ethical discussion surrounding the societal implications of predicting public opinions and values, especially concerning marginalized groups.
