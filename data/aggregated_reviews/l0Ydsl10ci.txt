Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a large-scale multimodal patent dataset, IMPACT, comprising half a million design patents with 3.6 million figures and captions from the US Patent and Trademark Office, spanning 2007 to 2022. The authors propose to perform patent classification and image/text retrieval, demonstrating that integrating images with generated captions enhances model performance on these tasks. Additionally, the paper discusses two underexplored tasks for future research: 3D Image Construction and Visual Question Answering.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-organized and easy to follow.
2. The background and related work discussions are comprehensive.
3. The dataset fills a gap in existing patent data by providing detailed descriptions necessary for multimodal tasks.
4. All data and code are available via an anonymous link.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper uses LLaVA for caption generation, claiming it outperforms GPT-4, which contradicts intuition; more advanced multimodal models should be considered for comparison.
2. The classification and retrieval tasks utilize limited backbone models; incorporating more advanced models could enhance the paper's quality.
3. The dataset's differentiation from existing works is unclear, particularly regarding its relation to the Harvard-USPTO dataset.
4. The relevance of the generated captions is not verified, and their impact on performance is unexplained.
5. The evaluation lacks dedicated models for patents, relying solely on generic Resnet and ViT.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how the collected dataset differs from existing crawled datasets, particularly in relation to the Harvard-USPTO dataset. Additionally, the authors should evaluate the relevance of the generated captions and provide explanations for their impact on performance. We suggest incorporating more advanced multimodal models for caption generation and comparative analysis to assess the quality of captions on retrieval and classification tasks. Finally, we encourage the authors to expand the discussion on the potential applications of the dataset, such as 3D image reconstruction and visual question answering, with examples to illustrate these tasks.
