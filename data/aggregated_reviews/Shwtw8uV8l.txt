Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Dual-Stream Interactive Transformer (DSIT) for single image reflection separation, introducing several tailored designs such as the Dual-Attention Interaction (DAI) and the Dual-Architecture Interactive Encoder (DAIE). The authors claim that their method achieves state-of-the-art performance on traditional datasets, addressing limitations of previous dual-stream frameworks by enhancing feature aggregation through dual-stream self-attention and layer-aware cross-attention.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method consistently outperforms baseline methods in benchmarking datasets for the image reflection separation task.
2. The introduction is well-written, providing a clear motivation for the proposed method.
3. The ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of the DAI in enhancing feature aggregation.

Weaknesses:
1. The methodology section is poorly articulated, with excessive use of unexplained abbreviations, making it difficult to follow.
2. The implementation details, such as the role of the pre-trained transformer and the specifics of the model architecture, are inadequately described.
3. There is a lack of clarity regarding the computational complexity and model settings, including comparisons of FLOPs and parameters.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology section by clearly defining all abbreviations upon first mention. Additionally, the authors should provide detailed explanations of the pre-trained transformerâ€™s role and clarify the implementation of the CAI. We suggest including a comparison of FLOPs and parameters in the results to better illustrate the computational complexity of the proposed method. Lastly, we encourage the authors to focus on real-world scenarios for reflection separation to enhance the practical applicability of their research.
