Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents PIDM, a novel generative model designed for generating 3D molecular conformations from 2D molecular graphs using an ODE-based diffusion model. The authors propose a denoising network with multiple modules to capture various physical information from molecules. Experimental results indicate that PIDM outperforms two baseline methods, GeoMol and GeoDiff, on benchmark datasets. However, the paper's clarity and organization are criticized, with several key details about the method and experiments lacking sufficient explanation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work introduces innovative strategies to capture geometric information from diverse inputs (e.g., bonds, bends, torsions) through different model modules, which can be beneficial for various molecular machine learning tasks.
- The experimental results demonstrate promising performance compared to strong baseline methods.

Weaknesses:
- Major weaknesses include insufficient detail in method descriptions, particularly regarding proper and improper torsions, the computation process in the graph attention module, and the outputs of the model.
- The paper lacks comprehensive ablation studies on the proposed modules and fails to compare with the significant baseline method, Torsional Diffusion.
- The organization of the paper is poor, with critical information about datasets and experiments not adequately presented.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing formal definitions for proper and improper torsions and explaining the cyclic constraint on proper torsions in detail. Additionally, the authors should clarify the outputs of the model and the computation process in the graph attention module. We suggest conducting comprehensive ablation studies on the novel modules and including Torsional Diffusion as a baseline for comparison. Furthermore, we advise reorganizing the paper to present the datasets before the experiments and enhancing the explanations of figures, particularly Figure 4, to improve overall understanding. Lastly, the authors should emphasize the practical importance of generating accurate static terms and conduct more experiments to support this claim.
