### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to next Point of Interest (POI) recommendation through the Hyperbolic Variational Graph AutoEncoder (HVGAE). The authors address two main challenges: modeling user preferences in Euclidean space, which inadequately captures hierarchical relationships among POIs, and the lack of research on embedding transformations into probabilistic distributions to mitigate data sparsity. HVGAE employs Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to effectively map node representations and utilizes a Variational Graph AutoEncoder (VGAE) to constrain latent variable distributions. The introduction of RPMamba enhances the model's ability to capture sequential relationships, with performance evaluations conducted on three datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper innovatively employs Hyperbolic GCN, VGAE, and Mamba, presenting a well-organized and comprehensive experimental section.
- The method effectively captures hierarchical relationships among POIs, demonstrating superior performance in top-5 hit rate evaluations.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a clear justification for the superiority of Hyperbolic space over Euclidean space, and relevant citations are missing to support this claim.
- The description of embedding transformations into probabilistic distributions is unclear, failing to articulate its significance in addressing data sparsity.
- The motivation for the introduction of the new technology stacks is insufficiently explained, impacting the clarity of their relevance.
- The baseline models used for comparison do not adequately represent next POI recommendation, necessitating the inclusion of more recent and relevant studies.
- Discrepancies in performance metrics, particularly for Foursquare datasets, require clarification regarding dataset processing.
- The proposed methodology's code is not provided, and critical operations in the method description lack explanation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the advantages of using Hyperbolic space, including relevant citations to support their claims. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the embedding transformations into probabilistic distributions and their relevance to data sparsity. It would be beneficial to articulate the motivation behind the selected technology stacks more clearly. We suggest incorporating the most recent baseline models tailored for next POI recommendation to strengthen the evaluation. Furthermore, the authors should address the performance discrepancies observed in the Foursquare datasets and clarify the dataset processing methods used. Lastly, providing the code for the proposed methodology and enhancing the explanation of critical operations would significantly improve the manuscript.
