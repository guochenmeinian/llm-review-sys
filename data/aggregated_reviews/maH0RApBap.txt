### Key Points
This paper presents a diffusion model-based method for coarse-grained Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) generation, marking a significant advancement in deep learning applications for MOF design. The authors propose an encoding and decoding process utilizing contrastive-learning pretrained GemNet, which effectively reduces the computational burden of MOF structure representation and enables guided generation based on desired properties. Experimental results indicate that MOFs generated through MOFDiff are promising for gas adsorption tasks. However, the motivation for selecting a diffusion model over language models for MOF generation is questioned, given existing methods like MOFid and Transformers.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The manuscript is clearly written and presents a novel approach in the field of MOF generation.  
- The method is sound, with a significant reduction in computational burden and the potential for guided generation.  
- Experimental results demonstrate the utility of the generated MOFs in gas adsorption tasks.  

Weaknesses:  
- The overall motivation for choosing a diffusion model instead of language models is unclear.  
- UFF may not be suitable for organometallics and non-covalent interactions, with better alternatives available.  
- Lack of configurational sampling in the assembling process raises concerns about flexibility in linkers.  
- The authors mention the expense of GCMC simulations without proposing a model training approach.  
- The use of local optimizers like Adam may lead to local optima; a global optimizer could be more effective.  
- The latent space PCA visualization could benefit from labeling known popular MOFs for reference.  
- The robustness and reversibility of the encoded representation require further testing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their motivation for selecting a diffusion model over language models for MOF generation. Additionally, consider utilizing better alternative force fields or semi-QM methods like xTB for improved accuracy. We suggest incorporating configurational sampling in the assembling process to address flexibility concerns. Training a model on GCMC simulations could also be beneficial. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore the use of a global optimizer in place of Adam to avoid local optima. Labeling known popular MOFs in the latent space PCA visualization would enhance the interpretability of the results. Lastly, we recommend testing the robustness and reversibility of the encoded representation to strengthen the findings.
