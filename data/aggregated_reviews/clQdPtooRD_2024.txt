Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on finding the top eigenvector from samples, specifically focusing on the problem of streaming sparse PCA under iid data. The authors propose a one-pass Oja's algorithm that operates in \(O(nd)\) time and \(O(d)\) space, aiming to minimize the \(\sin^2\) error defined as \(1 - \langle \hat{v}, v \rangle^2\). The algorithm is designed to work under the assumption that the top eigenvector \(v_1\) is \(s\)-sparse, with \(s\) being \(O(\frac{n}{\log(n)})\). The results indicate that the proposed method achieves a minimax error bound while relaxing previous assumptions regarding effective rank.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem addressed is well-motivated and relevant to the field.
- The paper is well-written, making it accessible to readers of varying expertise.
- The proposed algorithm is novel, with a detailed convergence analysis and supportive numerical experiments.
- The literature review is thorough, clearly demonstrating improvements over prior works.

Weaknesses:
- The main technique relies heavily on the known Oja's algorithm, raising questions about the introduction of fundamentally new ideas.
- Some terminologies, such as \(\sin^2\) error, are not defined before their first use, which could hinder clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by defining key terms, such as \(r_{\text{eff}}\) and \(\sin^2\) error, prior to their usage. Additionally, addressing notation inconsistencies, particularly with symbols like \(y_0\), \(u_0\), \(w_0\), and \(z_0\), would enhance readability. It would also be beneficial to clarify the conditions under which Theorem 3.2 applies, particularly regarding the requirement \(k = s\). Finally, we suggest improving the readability of figures by increasing font sizes and ensuring axes are clearly labeled.
