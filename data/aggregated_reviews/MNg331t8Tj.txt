Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SaSPA, a generative augmentation method specifically designed for fine-grained visual classification (FGVC). The authors propose a technique that generates diverse, class-consistent synthetic images by conditioning on edge maps and subject representations, utilizing ControlNet and BLIP diffusion. The method aims to enhance class fidelity while maintaining high variance in images, outperforming baselines across five datasets. The authors demonstrate the method's effectiveness in various scenarios, including full dataset training and few-shot classification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. SaSPA is well-motivated and presents a carefully crafted pipeline that addresses fidelity issues through strong conditioning and filtering.
2. The methodology is impressive, combining existing techniques in a novel way, making it intuitive and easy to implement.
3. The paper is well-written and logically structured, with thorough experiments and extensive evaluations justifying design choices.

Weaknesses:
1. The results do not convincingly demonstrate the method's potential to achieve state-of-the-art performance in FGVC, particularly on the CUB dataset.
2. The method's performance on higher resolution images is concerning, as it underperforms compared to CutMix on CUB.
3. The evaluation datasets are limited to common objects, raising questions about the method's generalizability to less common domains.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by testing SaSPA on larger and more diverse datasets, such as the ImageNet dogs setup, to strengthen the paper's contributions. Additionally, the authors should clarify how the method performs on state-of-the-art FGVC classifiers and explore its applicability to datasets with less common meta-classes. We also suggest providing a clearly marked limitations section to address the performance issues noted, particularly regarding high-resolution images. Lastly, consider revising the filtering step to utilize a model trained on the dataset for potentially better data quality.
