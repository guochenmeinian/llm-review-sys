### Key Points
This paper presents DNDesign, a denoising training module integrated with inverse folding networks (IFNN) to enhance protein design. The folding physics learning plug-in module (FPLM) utilizes score-matching with noise on the protein backbone and incorporates operations like summation and attention mechanisms to improve feature integration. Experimental results indicate that PiFold with FPLM outperforms previous IFNNs on CATH 4.2 and 4.3 datasets. Additionally, the authors introduce a fixed backbone conservation analysis based on potential energy changes to assess IFNN performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The investigation of the protein inverse folding problem is a novel application of deep learning techniques.
2. The fixed backbone conservation analysis leverages physical principles to evaluate IFNN performance.
3. The integration of denoising techniques is expected to enhance performance in inverse folding tasks.

Weaknesses:
1. The improvement of DNDesign over the original PiFold appears marginal.
2. The clarity of the paper's writing is lacking, with some notations and technical details poorly explained.
3. DNDesign is only tested with PiFold, raising questions about its applicability as a plug-in for other IFNNs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing and provide clearer explanations of notations and technical details. Additionally, we suggest that the authors highlight the connection between their work and previous studies on denoising training in molecular contexts. To strengthen the validation of FPLM, the authors should explore its integration with other IFNNs and provide further experimental evidence of its performance gains. We also encourage the authors to consider applying denoising as a pre-training strategy for IFNNs rather than as a separate plug-in module. Lastly, discussing the accuracy of Rosetta in evaluating potential energy and addressing the marginal improvements in experimental results would enhance the paper's rigor.
