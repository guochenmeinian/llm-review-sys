### Key Points
This paper presents an approach for optimizing Thompson Samples drawn from a Gaussian Process (GP) globally using univariate global rootfinding methods. The authors effectively address the challenges of finding global optimizers in higher dimensions by identifying a multivariate separable representation of prior samples, which allows for quick identification of local optima. The authors propose that this method may lead to faster convergence compared to standard random initialization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The approach is well-motivated and supported by robust mathematical explanations.
2. The visualizations effectively illustrate the necessary components of the method.
3. The writing is clear and the structure is easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
1. The test suite is limited to only two functions, making the claim of "dramatic improvements in the overall performance of BO using GP-TS acquisition functions" in the abstract overly strong, despite promising results in two and ten-dimensional spaces.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the notation on line 42 to clarify that $f(x_*) | \mathcal{D} \sim \mathcal{N}(...)$ reflects the posterior distribution. Additionally, we suggest defining $s(i)$ before its introduction on line 89 and clarifying the notation $\lambda_k$ on line 68. A longer description of Figure 1 is necessary to elucidate the relationships between the curves. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to extend their work to stationary kernels and provide an algorithm detailing its implementation, along with time complexity measures.
