Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) by introducing a hierarchical MDP framework and employing synthetic data to enhance training efficiency. The authors propose the Synthetically-enhanced Hierarchical Environment Design (SHED) method, which utilizes generative modeling, specifically a diffusion model, to create synthetic trajectory datasets. This approach aims to reduce the resource-intensive interactions between agents and environments. The results indicate that SHED performs comparably to ACCEL across various domains, with a smoother learning curve suggesting enhanced robustness and stability in training. However, the effectiveness of SHED does not convincingly demonstrate superiority over current state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The hierarchical MDP formulation is valuable, moving towards a more informed environment generation process.
- The use of diffusion models for generating synthetic trajectories effectively reduces the computational burden on the teacher agent.
- The hierarchical framework addresses the challenge of training under resource constraints by limiting the number of generated environments and training interactions.
- Comprehensive experiments across different domains demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- The results do not convincingly demonstrate SHED's superiority over existing methods, particularly when compared to ACCEL.
- The motivation for the work lacks clarity, with numerous comparisons made without a clear takeaway.
- Some technical details, such as the generation of actions and next states using the diffusion model, are insufficiently illustrated.
- The method is limited in the types of environments it can generate, as it relies on LLMs for maze generation rather than direct block placement.
- The complexity of the hierarchical MDP and generative modeling may hinder accessibility and reproducibility.
- The computational demand for training, particularly in environments like Bipedal Walker, raises concerns about feasibility.
- Figures and presentation aspects, such as axis scaling and consistent formatting, require improvement.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper's motivation to ensure that the key contributions are easily identifiable. Additionally, we suggest providing more rigorous analyses and comparisons against standard versions of existing methods like ACCEL, including a baseline comparison of normal ACCEL performance in the maze generation method used. It would be beneficial to include a more detailed technical illustration of how actions and next states are generated using the diffusion model. We also encourage the authors to soften the claims regarding outperforming state-of-the-art UED methods, emphasizing competitiveness instead. Lastly, we suggest revising figures for better clarity and consistency, ensuring that all relevant details are included, such as reward scales and proper formatting, while exploring broader applicability across diverse environments to validate the generalizability of SHED.
