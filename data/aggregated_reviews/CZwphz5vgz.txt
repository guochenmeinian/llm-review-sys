Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents OccFusion, a 3D human avatar creation system that integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and 2D diffusion models to render occluded regions effectively. The method involves three stages: initialization, where complete human masks are generated using a pre-trained diffusion model; optimization, where 3DGS is refined with score distillation sampling (SDS) to recover occluded areas; and refinement, which employs in-context inpainting to enhance rendering quality. The authors claim state-of-the-art performance on datasets like ZJU-MoCap and OcMotion.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach addresses the significant problem of recovering 3D human avatars from occluded images, which is largely unexplored.
- The incorporation of pre-trained diffusion models is a reasonable and innovative choice.
- The three-stage strategy is efficient and well-motivated, with thorough evaluations supporting its effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The overall rendering quality is poor, with visible blurriness even in non-occluded areas.
- Inconsistencies in the binary masks used for optimization raise questions about their reliability.
- The paper's writing requires polishing, and some important details are either omitted or introduced too late in the text.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the rendering quality, as the current outputs are often blurry, particularly in visible areas. Clarifying the consistency of the binary masks in Figure 4 is essential, as it impacts the optimization process. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the paper's writing for clarity and coherence. It would be beneficial to include more extensive ablation studies and visualizations to support claims about appearance consistency. Finally, addressing the training time and its implications on performance should be more explicitly discussed in the text.
