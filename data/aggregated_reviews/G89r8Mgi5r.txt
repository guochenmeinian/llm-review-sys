Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CRFed, a framework designed to address the challenges of non-i.i.d. data in federated learning through a diffusion-based data harmonization mechanism. The authors propose an adaptive indicator function for importance sampling, which aims to reduce data distribution disparities across nodes. The method is evaluated empirically on five datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy and convergence speed compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The diffusion-based data harmonization mechanism is innovative and effectively aligns local data distributions with a desired global distribution.
- The paper provides clear explanations and well-drawn figures, enhancing understanding of the methodology.
- Extensive experiments show that CRFed outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy and convergence speed.

Weaknesses:
- The clarity of the indicator function and its derivation is insufficiently explained, leading to confusion about its role and relationship with optimal data distribution.
- The necessity and training process of the diffusion model are not adequately discussed, raising questions about its contribution to the framework.
- Some notations and hyperparameters lack clear definitions, and the iterative denoising process may face scalability issues with large datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the indicator function by providing a detailed derivation and explanation of its significance. Additionally, a thorough discussion on the training process of the diffusion model and its necessity should be included. A sensitivity analysis of hyperparameters, particularly the confidence threshold, would enhance the robustness of the findings. Furthermore, addressing the potential scalability issues of the iterative denoising process in large datasets would strengthen the paper. Finally, including a brief discussion on future work could provide valuable insights into the ongoing development of this research.
