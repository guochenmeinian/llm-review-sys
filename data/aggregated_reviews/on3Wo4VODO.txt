Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a survey of past legal NLP research, identifying relevant tasks for legal practitioners and highlighting the gap between legal NLP tasks and the actual requirements of legal work. The authors argue that certain under-studied tasks, such as citations extraction and legal passage prediction, are essential for practitioners. They also emphasize the importance of addressing biases in legal decisions through NLP. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper's purpose is highly relevant and has the potential to shape future research directions in legal NLP.
- It effectively critiques existing research trends and makes a persuasive case for a re-orientation towards more practical applications for legal practitioners.
- The systematic review of over 170 articles provides a solid foundation for its claims.

Weaknesses:
- The analysis relies heavily on a single source (Zhong et al.), which may limit its comprehensiveness.
- It inadequately addresses challenges such as access to clean and annotated legal data, which are crucial for NLP applications.
- The argument regarding the irrelevance of legal passage judgment (LPJ) lacks nuance, as it overlooks potential applications in specific legal contexts.
- The discussion on the validity of annotations could be strengthened, particularly regarding multi-document processing and the nature of ground truth.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comprehensiveness of their literature review by incorporating more recent studies in legal NLP to support their claims. Additionally, the authors should address the challenges of data access more thoroughly, including the implications of proprietary data and privacy issues. It would also be beneficial to provide a more nuanced discussion of LPJ's relevance in various legal contexts. Finally, clarifying the nature of annotations and their ground truth in legal documents would enhance the paper's argument.
