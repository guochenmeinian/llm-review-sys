Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents FLock, a federated learning (FL) framework that integrates blockchain state channels to enhance privacy, security, and decentralization. FLock effectively addresses challenges such as model robustness against poisoning attacks and data privacy, achieving compatibility with existing blockchain platforms like Ethereum. The authors propose a lightweight, multi-party computation-friendly aggregation method that significantly reduces communication and computation overhead while maintaining accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- FLock is the first framework to utilize off-chain state channels, enabling low-cost and scalable FL with fair incentives.
- The secure aggregation method achieves robustness against up to 50% malicious clients without relying on a root dataset.
- The evaluation demonstrates practical deployment and compatibility with widely adopted blockchain platforms.

Weaknesses:
- The practical applications of FLock remain unclear, and the motivation for using blockchain could be better articulated.
- The incentive mechanism may be vulnerable to collusion or competition among participants.
- The paper lacks detailed discussions on the impact of varying dataset sizes and dynamic network environments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the practical applications of FLock by providing real-world examples of its utility over other FL methods. Additionally, the authors should better motivate the use of blockchain, particularly regarding the necessity of recording weights on-chain for reward distribution. It would be beneficial to clarify the incentive mechanisms and address potential risks of collusion among participants. 

We suggest that the authors differentiate between the threat models for aggregators and clients more clearly in Sec 3.2. Furthermore, the determination of lambda in Sec 4.2 should be explained, and the implications of the failure of P_4 in Fig 2 should be addressed in the main text. 

To enhance the comparison with existing methods, we recommend adding discussions on how FLock's aggregation method differs from FLOD and providing a detailed breakdown of communication and computational overhead. Finally, we encourage the authors to open-source the smart contract implemented in the study for transparency.
