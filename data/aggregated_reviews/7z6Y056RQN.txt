### Key Points
This paper presents a method for predicting observations at spatial locations using Gaussian Processes (GPs) in large datasets, specifically those with at least \(10^6\) points. The authors propose a Vecchia approximation to subsample points, aiming to reduce computational costs associated with the covariance matrix's inverse and determinant calculations. They introduce a mini-batch subsampling approach during an iterative procedure, which provides an unbiased estimator for the gradient and mitigates the high computational demands of Langevin Monte Carlo algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem statement and literature gaps are clearly articulated.
- The methodology is comprehensive, allowing readers to follow the algorithm's setup and calculations.
- The selection of benchmarks for comparison with existing work is relevant and well-defined.

Weaknesses:
- The results demonstrating the algorithm's superiority over four baselines are not included in the main text.
- There is a lack of statistical significance testing or cross-validation for the results presented.
- The method is evaluated on only one dataset, with no discussion of future steps or potential synthetic dataset generation for exploratory analysis.
- The Discussion section does not outline next steps or experiments for the project.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation of results by including the comparisons with the four baselines directly in the main body of the text. Additionally, we suggest incorporating statistical significance testing and cross-validation steps to strengthen the findings. The authors should consider evaluating their method on multiple datasets and include discussions on synthetic dataset generation to facilitate exploratory studies. Finally, we encourage the authors to outline future experiments and next steps in the Discussion section to provide clarity on the project's trajectory.
