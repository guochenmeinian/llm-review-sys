### Key Points
This paper presents a novel information theoretic measure termed Feature-specific Information Transfer (FIT), aimed at quantifying feature-specific information transfer between brain regions. The authors validate FIT through synthetic and real-world neural recordings, leveraging concepts from Partial Information Decomposition (PID) and the Wiener-Granger causality principle to analyze information flow. The method is evaluated against Directed Feature Information (DFI) and applied to various neural datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in understanding brain communication. Additionally, the authors provide a detailed analysis of the statistical associations between two signals, X and Y, through surrogate data generated by specific permutations that maintain essential correlations. They propose a new null model simulating linear mixtures of sources, demonstrating that the permutation test effectively identifies genuine time-lagged communication while controlling for noise correlations. The authors acknowledge the limitations of surrogate data and plan to clarify these aspects in the revised manuscript.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Originality: The introduction of FIT represents a significant contribution to the field, building on recent advances in PID.
- Quality: The theoretical derivations are robust, supported by both simulated and real data.
- Clarity: The paper is well-written, with high-quality illustrations that enhance understanding.
- Significance: FIT is positioned as a valuable tool for studying communication between brain areas.
- Thorough explanation: The authors provide a thorough explanation of their permutation method and its implications for statistical analysis.
- Commitment to improvement: The authors show a commitment to addressing reviewer concerns and improving the manuscript based on feedback.

Weaknesses:
- Terminology: The term "feature-specific" may be misleading; "stimulus-specific" might be more appropriate.
- Presentation: Important content is relegated to the appendix, which may hinder comprehension for readers less familiar with PID.
- Technical Details: Some critical technical aspects, such as the calculations of information theoretic metrics, are insufficiently detailed in the main text.
- Initial clarity: The initial clarity regarding the permutation method and its effects on noise correlations was lacking.
- Nomenclature issues: Some nomenclature issues remain that require further clarification to avoid confusion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of terminology by considering the use of "stimulus-specific" instead of "feature-specific." Additionally, we suggest that the authors summarize the contributions of their work at the end of Section 1 to enhance reader comprehension. It would be beneficial to provide more theoretical insights and intuitive explanations within the main text rather than relying heavily on the supplement. Furthermore, we urge the authors to address the behavior of FIT in the presence of mixed signals, including empirical evidence and theoretical discussions on how the method performs under such conditions. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their explanation regarding the permutation method and its implications for noise correlations. Additionally, we suggest that the authors enhance the nomenclature used in the paper to ensure that all terms are clearly defined and understood by the readers. Finally, we encourage the authors to include a discussion of the assumptions and limitations of their surrogate permutation tests in the revised manuscript.
