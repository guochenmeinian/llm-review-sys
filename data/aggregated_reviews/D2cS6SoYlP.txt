Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel solution for Simulation Based Inference (SBI) through Flow Matching Posterior Estimation (FMPE), which serves as an alternative to Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE). The authors leverage Flow Matching (FM) generative models to enhance SBI's accuracy and efficiency, citing empirical and theoretical evidence for FM's advantages, including easy sampling and tractable likelihood estimation. A series of experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FMPE compared to existing methods, particularly in gravitational-wave inference tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and structured, making it easy to follow.
- Theoretical results provide good intuitions despite constrained hypotheses.
- The inclusion of a limitations section is commendable, as it is often overlooked in SBI literature.

Weaknesses:
- The likelihood of FM is expensive, making it unsuitable for SBI, a point not discussed in the paper.
- Experimental results do not convincingly demonstrate superiority over NPE, particularly in density estimation tasks.
- Benchmarks may not be challenging enough, raising questions about the robustness of the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the computational cost of FM's likelihood, as it significantly impacts the fairness of comparisons. Addressing the poor performance in density estimation tasks, particularly in Figures 4 and 9, is crucial. We suggest providing a reference for the computation of Eq (54) in Appendix B and clarifying the integration steps used in experiments. Additionally, we encourage the authors to explore more demanding inference problems to better showcase the technical contributions of their work. Finally, we recommend elaborating on the scalability of FMPE concerning high-dimensional parameter spaces, as the current claims may be misleading.
