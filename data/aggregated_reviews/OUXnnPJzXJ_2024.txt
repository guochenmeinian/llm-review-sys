### Key Points
This paper presents Perplexity-Aware Correction (PerpCorrect), a method designed to enhance the alignment of large language models (LLMs) by detecting and correcting noisy preferences (NPs). PerpCorrect utilizes the perplexity difference (PPLDiff) between chosen and rejected responses to identify NPs, aligning a surrogate LLM with clean validation data and refining it with reliable training data. Experimental results indicate that PerpCorrect significantly improves alignment performance, is effective with minimal validation data, and is compatible with various existing alignment techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper innovatively addresses the impact of noisy preferences on alignment through a correction-focused approach.
2. Comprehensive experiments cover a range of existing alignment methods, demonstrating that PerpCorrect achieves state-of-the-art performance across different LLMs and datasets.
3. The method is well-documented, with clear explanations, mathematical formulations, and pseudocode, enhancing its accessibility and reproducibility.
4. PerpCorrect shows strong performance with limited clean validation data, which is advantageous in scenarios where such data is scarce.

Weaknesses:
1. The standard deviation of reward accuracy is not reported in Tables 3, 4, and 6.
2. The method's performance heavily relies on the availability of a high-quality clean validation dataset, necessitating a discussion on potential solutions to this limitation.
3. The process of calculating PPLDiff for each data point and aligning a surrogate LLM multiple times could be computationally intensive, warranting further discussion on the associated costs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing, particularly in Line 50, where the logic regarding the overlooked differences between noisy and clean preferences needs to be elucidated. Additionally, we suggest that the authors discuss the complexity and additional computation time involved in implementing PerpCorrect, as well as potential strategies to mitigate the reliance on high-quality clean validation datasets. Finally, addressing the lack of standard deviation reporting in the results would enhance the robustness of the findings.
