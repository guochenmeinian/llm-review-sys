Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an end-to-end differentiable particle smoother (MDPS) that enhances global localization in real-world city-scale environments. The authors propose a novel framework that combines two Mixture Density Particle Filters (MDPFs) operating in forward and backward directions, leveraging the Two Filter Smoothing (TFS) principle. MDPS is shown to outperform MDPF and other non-probabilistic methods in terms of log-likelihood and tracking accuracy. Additionally, the paper discusses the theoretical foundations of KDE-based particle filters, referred to as “regularized” particle filters, which offer strong convergence guarantees and improved performance over conventional discrete-resampling particle filters. The authors emphasize that regularized filters provide better stability and robustness, particularly in low-noise dynamics, and facilitate accurate gradient estimation during training. The computation of gradients for the KDE resampling step is addressed, asserting that it can be achieved using an unbiased estimator based on importance sampling principles.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces the first framework for end-to-end differentiable particle smoothing, which is expected to yield better accuracy than filtering.  
- The technical approach effectively integrates MDPF and TFS, demonstrating a sound design for the differentiable smoothing framework.  
- Empirical results indicate a clear advantage of the proposed smoothing framework over filtering counterparts and prior non-probabilistic methods.  
- Theoretical foundations of regularized particle filters are robust, with strong convergence guarantees.  
- Regularized filters demonstrate improved stability and robustness in practice, particularly for low-noise dynamics.  
- The paper provides novel insights into gradient estimation for KDE resampling.

Weaknesses:  
- Some mathematical formulations in Section 3, particularly equations (14) and (15), appear incorrect and require clarification and correction.  
- The clarity and rigor of the presentation need significant improvement, particularly regarding the definition and application of "stratified" resampling, which may not align with established literature.  
- Figures lack readability, with many components being too small, necessitating larger fonts and clearer legends.  
- The paper lacks comprehensive details on MDPF, particularly regarding the "adaptive" variant and its necessity for two bandwidths.  
- The manuscript's presentation is criticized for being informal and lacking rigor, making it difficult to follow.  
- The application used to showcase the proposed method lacks convincing relevance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the mathematical clarity in Section 3 by revisiting equations (14) and (15) to ensure correctness and relevance to the practical implementation of MDPS. Additionally, enhancing the readability of figures by increasing font sizes and component visibility is essential. We suggest including more comprehensive details on MDPF at the end of Section 2 to clarify the "adaptive" variant and its implications. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide pseudo-code in an appendix to enhance understanding of the proposed algorithm. We also recommend improving the clarity and rigor of the manuscript, particularly in the explanation of "stratified" resampling, to align with established definitions in the literature. Reviewing particle filter publications in high-ranking computational statistics journals from the past decade for guidance could enhance the presentation. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide a more compelling application to showcase the utility of their proposed method.
