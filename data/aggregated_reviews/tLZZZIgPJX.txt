### Key Points
This paper investigates self-preference bias in LLMs when used as evaluators of dialogue responses. The authors propose a novel quantitative metric to measure this bias and analyze its potential causes, finding that some LLMs exhibit significant self-preference bias linked to perplexity. The work is well-organized and presents empirical results across multiple LLMs, contributing to the understanding of bias in automated evaluations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Proposes a novel metric for measuring self-preference bias.
- Provides empirical results across various LLMs.
- Analyzes potential causes of self-preference bias, particularly its connection to perplexity.
- The paper is well-written and clearly structured.

Weaknesses:
- Limited discussion on the underlying reasons for LLMs' overestimation or underestimation of their outputs.
- Insufficient exploration of potential mitigation strategies.
- Lack of concrete examples illustrating harmful self-preference bias.
- Ambiguity in the justification for the chosen metric of Equal Opportunity over Demographic Parity.
- Over-reliance on perplexity without adequate justification or consideration of other factors.
- Lack of robust statistical techniques for evaluating preferences, undermining the interpretation of results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the underlying reasons for LLMs' self-preference bias and provide concrete examples of potential real-world harm. Additionally, clarify the problem statement and the significance of self-preference bias. To enhance the impact of the work, provide actionable thresholds or guidelines for acceptable levels of self-preference bias and suggest specific mitigation strategies based on findings. 

We also suggest justifying the choice of Equal Opportunity for the self-preference bias metric and exploring other potential explanations for bias beyond perplexity. Strengthening the statistical robustness of the analysis through proper hypothesis testing and reporting effect sizes and confidence intervals would also be beneficial. Finally, consider adding the code and additional details in an appendix, and discuss the implications of significant increases in perplexity on bias trends.
