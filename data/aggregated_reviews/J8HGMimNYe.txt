### Key Points
This paper presents a new concept for optical microscopy through an algorithm named XLUMINA, which allows users to input a desired goal and alters experimental configurations accordingly. The authors demonstrate that XLUMINA can rediscover three known optical layouts, although it has not yet proven its ability to discover novel microscopy concepts. The work is original and significant, with the potential to enhance existing setups and facilitate the discovery of innovative optical hardware.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The algorithm is well-written in JAX, achieving significant speed improvements compared to Diffractio.  
- The paper is clearly articulated and well-structured.  
- The originality and significance of the work are notable, with potential implications for the field of super-resolution microscopy.

Weaknesses:  
- The evaluation of the algorithm's quality is limited due to the lack of code disclosure.  
- There is no demonstration of XLUMINA's capability to discover new microscopy concepts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the supplementary information section to detail all components of the algorithm, including the optics simulator, AI-based tool, loss functions, and early-stop criteria. Additionally, making the code open-source would enhance community adoption. To strengthen the introduction, we suggest referencing key papers that highlight the groundbreaking biological discoveries enabled by super-resolution microscopy.
