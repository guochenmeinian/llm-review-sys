### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for abstractive text summarization that emphasizes factual correctness and faithfulness through the use of energy functions. These functions evaluate consistency aspects and are integrated into both training and inference processes to enhance summary quality. The authors propose that their approach can outperform existing models in terms of factuality and faithfulness, although the reported ROUGE scores do not reach state-of-the-art levels.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The integration of consistency-based energy functions into summarization models is a novel contribution.
2. The paper is well-written, with clear descriptions of results.
3. The proposed method addresses the challenge of consistency in current language models.

Weaknesses:
1. The proposed method does not consistently outperform baseline models across all metrics.
2. There is a lack of ablation studies to demonstrate the impact of individual components.
3. Some essential methodological details are missing, making practical implementation unclear.
4. The distinction between this approach and existing methods is not adequately articulated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the distinction between their method and existing summarization approaches. Additionally, conducting a human evaluation of the generated summaries would provide valuable insights into the proposed consistency metrics. An ablation study should be included to assess the effects of different loss functions and decoding strategies. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the implementation details of the energy functions and address the missing references to relevant literature.
