### Key Points
This paper presents a new randomized algorithm for computing an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy in discounted Markov decision processes (MDPs). The authors propose an $\tilde{O}(A_{\text{tot}}[(1-\gamma)^{-3} \varepsilon^{-2}+(1-\gamma)^{-2}])$-time algorithm in the sampling setting with an unknown transition matrix, and an $\tilde{O}(s + A_{\text{tot}}(1-\gamma)^{-2})$-time algorithm in the offline setting with a known, $s$-sparse transition matrix. The core innovation is the introduction of Truncated Variance-Reduced Value Iteration (TVRVI), which improves sample complexity bounds and utilizes a new variant of variance reduction to control update variances.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1) The algorithm achieves state-of-the-art sample complexity bounds for model-free methods, particularly for large $\epsilon$.
2) The mathematical formulation and proofs are well-structured and rigorous.
3) The concept of truncated variance VI is innovative and may lead to practical algorithms with reduced computational costs.
4) The paper effectively incorporates advanced variance reduction techniques, demonstrating a clear improvement over prior works.

Weaknesses:
1) The presentation is at times difficult to follow, with numerous typos and formatting issues throughout the paper.
2) The lack of experimental validation limits the practical applicability of the theoretical results.
3) There are concerns regarding the constants in the theoretical results, particularly in Lemma 2.2 and the burn-in phase of Algorithm 6.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by addressing the numerous typos and formatting issues throughout the paper. Additionally, including a simple example on finite MDPs would help validate the computational cost and the new truncated variance VI algorithm. We also suggest that the authors clarify their claims regarding memory usage in model-based methods and consider strengthening the constants in their theoretical results. Finally, a discussion on the implications of the trade-offs between constant factors and polylogarithmic factors in $\epsilon$ and $\delta$ would enhance the paper's depth.
