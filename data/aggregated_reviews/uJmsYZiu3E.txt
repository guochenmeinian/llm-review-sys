Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the allocation of indivisible chores among agents with non-additive preferences, specifically focusing on the maximin share (MMS) allocation problem. The authors establish that for submodular costs, the best approximation factor is lower bounded by min{n, log m / log log m}, while for subadditive costs, it is bounded by min{n, log m}. They explore special cases such as bin-packing and job scheduling, providing algorithms for achieving 1-out-of-(n/2) MMS allocations. The paper contributes new theoretical results and mechanisms tailored to these cost functions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant and natural problem in chore allocation beyond additive costs.
- The theoretical results are solid, complete, and utilize interesting techniques, contributing to the fair division research community.

Weaknesses:
- The main algorithmic results for bin-packing and scheduling appear to be adaptations of standard approximation algorithms, lacking explicit connections to what is novel in this work.
- The writing could be improved for clarity, as some sections require rereading to grasp the concepts fully.
- The newly developed mechanisms lack elegance and do not guarantee polynomial-time implementation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing, particularly in sections that are currently confusing or require rereading. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explicitly connect their algorithmic results to existing standard approximation algorithms to highlight the novelty of their contributions. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore the possibility of developing simpler mechanisms that achieve the same approximation guarantees and to address the implementation efficiency of their proposed mechanisms.
