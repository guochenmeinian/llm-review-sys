Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for creating expressive distributions through injective mappings that preserve mutual information (MI), as established in Theorem 2.1. The authors benchmark various MI estimators across multiple tasks, including high-dimensional and long-tailed distributions, and provide guidelines for practitioners on estimator selection. The paper identifies key challenges in MI estimation and proposes a comprehensive evaluation framework, addressing the limitations of existing benchmarks that often focus on simple distributions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is clear and well-structured, effectively presenting mathematical concepts and providing a thorough analysis of forty distinct MI estimation tasks.
- It highlights significant issues with current MI estimation benchmarks and introduces a diverse family of distributions, enhancing the understanding of estimator performance.
- The reproducibility of results is ensured through shared code and detailed documentation.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for each data setting is insufficiently explained, lacking examples of relevant domains for long-tail distributions.
- The significance of the main contributions appears limited, as they primarily extend the data settings considered in previous work.
- Theorem 2.1 may not be novel, as similar results exist in the literature, and the choice of distributions lacks sufficient justification.
- The last row of Figure 2, "True MI," is not clearly highlighted, making it difficult to discern its role as a point of comparison.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for each data setting by providing examples from relevant domains, such as insurance for long-tail distributions. Additionally, enhancing the visibility of the "True MI" in Figure 2 would aid clarity. To address concerns about the novelty of Theorem 2.1, we suggest referencing existing proofs, such as that by Kraskov et al. (2004), to provide context. Finally, expanding the family of distributions used in the benchmarks would strengthen the paper's contributions and applicability.
