### Key Points
This paper presents SAMGPT, a novel text-free graph foundation model aimed at multi-domain pretraining and cross-domain adaptation. The authors propose a Structure Alignment framework that utilizes structure tokens and a dual prompt strategy to enhance domain adaptation. Comprehensive experiments across seven public datasets demonstrate the model's effectiveness, showing significant performance improvements over existing baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. SAMGPT addresses a critical gap in graph foundation models by focusing on text-free graphs.
2. The dual prompt strategy effectively combines multi-domain structural knowledge with domain-specific adaptations, enhancing cross-domain learning.
3. The experiments are thorough, showcasing consistent improvements and the model's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
4. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with code and data provided for reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
1. The model's dependence on aligning features and structures raises concerns about its suitability for domains with significant structural differences.
2. There is no experimental validation to determine the most suitable unified dimension in the module of DAL.
3. The paper does not evaluate different backbones (e.g., GraphSAGE or GIN), limiting the adaptability perspective on SAMGPT.
4. The technical contributions appear limited, as the structure tokens resemble learnable masks similar to attention mechanisms.
5. The model does not scale well, as it uses full batch training and struggles with the number of domains due to increased parameters and hidden dimensions.
6. A detailed real-time efficiency and space complexity analysis is lacking, which would provide insights into the model's practicality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental validation to determine the most suitable unified dimension in the module of DAL. Additionally, the authors should evaluate SAMGPT with different backbones, such as GraphSAGE or GIN, to provide a broader adaptability perspective. A comprehensive analysis of real-time efficiency and space complexity should be included to clarify the computational cost and scalability of the proposed approach. Furthermore, we suggest addressing the clarity of claims regarding structural differences across domains and providing a more in-depth analysis to substantiate these assertions. Lastly, the authors should consider introducing specific optimization objectives to tackle cross-domain discrepancies, potentially incorporating out-of-distribution generalization techniques.
