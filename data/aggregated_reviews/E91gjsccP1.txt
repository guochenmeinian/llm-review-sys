### Key Points
This paper presents HtmlRAG, an enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that utilizes HTML format instead of plain text to preserve structural and semantic information in documents. The authors introduce HTML Cleaning and HTML Pruning modules to address the challenges of content length and semantic loss associated with HTML documents. Through extensive experiments on six question-answering datasets, HtmlRAG demonstrates significant improvements over traditional methods, although results in Table 2 raise questions about the marginal benefits of HTML compared to plain text.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The use of HTML retains valuable structural and semantic information, improving the understanding and generation capabilities of RAG systems.
2. The innovative HTML Cleaning and Pruning strategies, particularly the use of a lightweight LLM for block scoring, enhance the methodology's effectiveness.
3. The paper is well-organized, with clear illustrations and a thorough review of related work.

Weaknesses:
1. The baseline comparisons are unclear, particularly regarding whether results in Table 1 utilize HTML or plain text, which may affect fairness in evaluation.
2. Efficiency experiments lack comprehensive analysis, as inference latency is not reported, raising concerns about the claimed balance between efficiency and effectiveness.
3. The Generative Fine-Grained Block Pruning method is query-specific, limiting its generalizability and potentially impacting efficiency due to LLM inference requirements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of baseline comparisons by specifying the formats used in evaluations. Additionally, providing a detailed analysis of inference latency alongside token and storage consumption would strengthen the efficiency claims. The authors should also consider expanding the discussion on the limitations of plain text and include a quantitative analysis comparing its performance to HTML under controlled conditions. Furthermore, clarifying the criteria for identifying irrelevant HTML blocks during the cleaning process and detailing the scoring mechanism for pruning would enhance the robustness of the methodology.
