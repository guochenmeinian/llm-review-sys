### Key Points
This paper presents a method called CRUSH for retrieving relevant schema elements from large database schemas to enhance text-to-SQL systems. The authors propose a two-stage approach that first utilizes an LLM to hallucinate a minimal schema, followed by the retrieval of actual schema elements that cover this hallucinated schema. Additionally, the paper introduces two new large-schema benchmarks, SpiderUnion and SocialDB, for evaluating retrieval-augmented text-to-SQL systems. The proposed method shows improved recall over existing baselines, translating to gains in SQL accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The novel technique for schema retrieval using LLM hallucination addresses lexical gaps between queries and schema.
- The principled objective function for collective retrieval effectively balances coverage and connectivity.
- Thorough experimental analysis demonstrates significant gains over baselines.
- The introduction of new large-schema benchmarks enables more realistic evaluations.
- The paper is well-written, clearly articulating the limitations of prior work and the motivation for the technical approach.

Weaknesses:
- Evaluation is limited to the authors' new benchmarks; additional experiments on other datasets could strengthen the results.
- The hand-designed hallucination prompts based on gold schemas may limit real-world applicability, necessitating further analysis on robustness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the robustness of hallucination prompts to reduce reliance on gold schemas. Additionally, conducting experiments on external datasets would enhance the validation of their results. We also suggest providing examples of how hallucinated schemas differ from gold schemas and discussing the implications for downstream SQL accuracy. Finally, addressing challenges faced in real-world deployment compared to lab settings would enrich the paper's practical relevance.
