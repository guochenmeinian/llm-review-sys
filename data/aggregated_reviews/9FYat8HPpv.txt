Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a spike-guided self-supervised image deblurring algorithm that integrates high spatial resolution from RGB cameras with high temporal resolution from spike cameras to produce sharp RGB images in real-world scenarios. The authors propose a self-supervised framework that addresses performance degradation issues found in existing supervised spike deblurring algorithms. Validation through extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets confirms its superior performance and generalization ability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The proposed algorithm effectively addresses the synthetic-real domain gap performance degradation of previous algorithms.  
2. The authors provide a theoretical foundation for the Spike-Guided Deblurring Model (SDM) by analyzing the relationships between spike data, blurry RGB, and sharp RGB images.  
3. The paper is well-written, with clear figures and comprehensive experiments demonstrating the spatiotemporal alignment and generalization of the RGB-Spike binocular system.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The originality of the framework is marginal, as it bears similarities to existing work; further clarification on differences is needed.  
2. The proposed LDN is similar to the DCN in previous studies, and an ablation study comparing their performances would be beneficial.  
3. The robustness of the model to noise lacks systematic analysis, particularly regarding the influence of the BSN Loss described in Equation 9.  
4. The RSB dataset is limited in size and diversity, primarily containing indoor scenes; outdoor scenes with various objects are desired.  
5. The order of applying BSN and EDSR may introduce artifacts during image restoration, which requires further investigation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the differences between their framework and previous works, particularly [36]. Additionally, conducting an ablation study to compare LDN and DCN would enhance the understanding of their respective contributions. To address noise robustness, a systematic analysis should be included, focusing on the effects of the BSN Loss. Expanding the RSB dataset to include outdoor scenes with diverse objects would significantly enhance its applicability. Finally, investigating the impact of the order of applying BSN and EDSR on model performance could provide valuable insights.
