### Key Points
This paper presents an Information Directed Tree Search (IDTS) algorithm aimed at enhancing the reasoning and planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex tasks that require multi-step reasoning and feedback integration. By employing a Bayesian approach, the authors guide the search process toward feedback that offers higher information gain, utilizing in-context learning to estimate this gain without explicit posterior updates. While IDTS shows some advantages over simple uniform search methods, its performance is comparable to Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), raising questions about the complexity versus benefits of the method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of information gain into tree search for LLMs is a creative and novel idea.
- The paper provides rigorous theoretical backing, including proofs and formulations based on information theory and Bayesian inference.
- The authors openly discuss the limitations of their approach and identify areas for future research.
- Experiments demonstrate promising results, particularly in tasks involving corrective feedback.

Weaknesses:
- IDTS does not show significant performance gains over MCTS in the experiments conducted, and the reasons for the similarity in performance are not clearly explained.
- The paper lacks in-depth comparisons with other exploration strategies or uncertainty-guided algorithms.
- There is insufficient investigation into the estimation errors of information gain and alternative estimation methods.
- The paper does not explore how to dynamically adjust IDTS's search strategy based on the quality or type of feedback across different tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical validation of IDTS by providing more comprehensive experimental results and testing on additional benchmarks. A detailed comparison of IDTS with other advanced planning or search techniques beyond MCTS and simple uniform search methods should be included. Additionally, the authors should clarify the computational complexity of IDTS compared to MCTS and analyze the conditions under which IDTS might outperform existing methods. Finally, a more thorough explanation of the contextual learning mechanism, particularly in multi-step reasoning tasks, would enhance the clarity of the methodology.
