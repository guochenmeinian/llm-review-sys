Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for evaluating participant contributions in federated learning (FL) called SPACE. The authors identify two key challenges: multi-round training and dataset dependency, which impact communication and computational costs. To address these, they introduce Federated Knowledge Amalgamation, enabling a single round of communication, and Prototype-based Model Evaluation, which simplifies evaluation by comparing similarities without iterating through a validation set. The utility function is modified using a logistic function to enhance rationality. The authors demonstrate SPACE's effectiveness through experiments on two datasets, comparing it against four baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors effectively identify and address two significant challenges in participant contribution evaluation in FL.
- Detailed explanations of each module's purpose and functionality are provided.
- The paper offers theoretical insights into communication and computational costs associated with the proposed model.

Weaknesses:
- The writing style requires improvement, particularly in emphasizing key points such as computational complexity reduction.
- There is insufficient detail regarding the theoretical analysis of communication and computational costs, including GPU suitability.
- The rationale for the chosen activation function in section 4.3, which addresses rationality violations, is not adequately explained.
- The experimental section lacks results on computational and communication costs, which are crucial given the paper's focus on complexity reduction.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the writing style to better highlight key points, particularly regarding computational complexity reduction. Additionally, the authors should provide more detailed theoretical analysis on communication and computational costs, specifically how the design reduces complexity and its appropriateness for GPU usage. In section 4.3, the authors should clarify the choice of activation function and its effectiveness in avoiding rationality violations. Lastly, the authors should include results on computational and communication costs in the experimental section to align with the paper's focus on complexity reduction.
