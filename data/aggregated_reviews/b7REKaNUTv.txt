Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for calculating charge density using orbital-based representations integrated with an equivariant machine learning architecture. The authors introduce density functional theory (DFT) and emphasize the significance of charge density within DFT, highlighting the challenges of applying machine learning (ML) methods due to data density. The paper details the method's contributions, including a charge density representation using Gaussian-type orbitals and a prediction model based on an equivariant architecture. Experimental results demonstrate the method's effectiveness on the QM9 dataset, showcasing improvements over existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper proposes a new method that effectively integrates ML into computational chemistry workflows, addressing a relevant problem.
- It provides a comprehensive description of the methodology, background, and experimental setup.
- Experimental results indicate significant improvements in accuracy and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art models.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity on the differences between charge density prediction and ML potentials, including their respective advantages and disadvantages.
- There is insufficient detail on how the proposed charge density representation differs from prior approaches, such as a summary table.
- The experiments are limited to the QM9 dataset, raising concerns about potential overfitting and generalizability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by elaborating on the distinctions between charge density prediction and ML potentials, explicitly discussing their advantages and disadvantages. Additionally, we suggest including a summary table to highlight how the proposed charge density representation differs from previous methods. To enhance the robustness of the findings, we encourage the authors to validate their method on additional datasets beyond QM9, such as those used in previous studies. Furthermore, providing the code in the supplemental material would bolster confidence in the reproducibility of the results. Lastly, we recommend a more detailed explanation of the necessity of an equivariant network and whether non-equivariant networks were evaluated.
