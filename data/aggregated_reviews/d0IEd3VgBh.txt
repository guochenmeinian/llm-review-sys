Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of randomized classifiers and their robustness against adversarial examples. The authors propose necessary and sufficient conditions for constructing a randomized classifier from a set of deterministic classifiers that outperforms the best deterministic classifier in terms of adversarial risk. They also demonstrate that for every randomized ensemble classifier, a deterministic weighted ensemble can achieve better adversarial risk and identify conditions under which randomization aids deterministic classifiers. The paper addresses critical questions regarding when randomization is beneficial in adversarial classification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively answers important questions in adversarial learning regarding the role of randomization.
- The proofs are clear and straightforward, contributing to the paper's clarity.
- The writing is well-organized, making complex concepts accessible.

Weaknesses:
- The exposition lacks clarity in several areas, including the definition of terms and the organization of supplementary material.
- The theoretical findings primarily focus on binary classifiers, limiting practical applicability.
- Some key concepts, such as the "Matching Penny" notions, are not clearly defined, which may confuse readers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the exposition by explicitly defining terms such as "Borel Ïƒ-algebra" and providing a clear threat model. Additionally, we suggest that the authors reorganize the supplementary material for better coherence and include a detailed explanation of the "Matching Penny" concepts. To enhance the practical implications of their findings, we encourage the authors to discuss how their theoretical results can guide future empirical robust model design, especially in non-binary scenarios. Lastly, we advise moving Figure 1 closer to its first mention to improve readability.
