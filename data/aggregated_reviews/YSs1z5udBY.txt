Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of the training dynamics of neural networks, particularly focusing on a phenomenon termed "anticipatory recovery" during cyclic training, where models recover from forgetting before encountering examples again. The authors provide extensive experiments across various architectures, including language and vision models, and offer a theoretical characterization using a toy model. The findings suggest that this behavior is influenced by the temporal structure of gradients and model weights in cyclic training.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The discovery of "anticipatory recovery" is novel and contrasts with catastrophic forgetting, providing insights into model behavior during cyclic training.
- The experiments are comprehensive, covering multiple model sizes, optimization methods, and hyperparameters.
- The analysis is clear, with well-structured visualizations and theoretical insights supporting empirical findings.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a clear connection to common neural network training practices, making it challenging to appreciate the significance of the findings.
- The comparison between anticipatory recovery and catastrophic forgetting is misleading, as they occur under different training conditions.
- The practical implications of anticipatory recovery are limited, as fixed example order typically leads to worse generalization than random shuffling, and the phenomenon may not generalize to other structured training forms.
- The writing could be improved for clarity, with a need for better contextualization of results and implications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by summarizing main findings upfront to guide readers. Additionally, it would be beneficial to provide more discussion on the practical implications of anticipatory recovery, particularly how it could inform continual learning or curriculum design. We suggest addressing the limitations of the experiments more explicitly and considering a broader range of models and datasets to strengthen the findings. Furthermore, clarifying the relevance of the prequential evaluation setting and the choice of the toy model in the theoretical analysis would enhance the paper's depth.
