### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method utilizing network analysis to identify coordinated accounts across social media platforms (Twitter, Telegram, and Facebook) during the 2024 U.S. election. The authors reveal significant findings regarding cross-platform inauthentic behavior and the nature of shared content, which is often partisan and low-credibility. The research methodology is robust, employing state-of-the-art technologies, and the authors maintain transparency by discussing limitations. However, the paper could benefit from clearer definitions and stronger connections between research questions and findings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, organized, and easy to follow.
- It provides a thorough analysis and justifies methodological choices.
- The investigation into cross-platform inauthentic behavior is a timely and relevant contribution.

Weaknesses:
- The focus on inauthenticity lacks depth; the criteria for labeling accounts as inauthentic are not sufficiently clear.
- The discussion section could be expanded to emphasize the implications of the findings.
- Some methodological descriptions, such as the "Density-based network dismantling," require clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of key terms, particularly "coordinated inauthentic activity," by providing explicit criteria for identifying inauthenticity. Additionally, the authors should enhance the discussion to highlight the unique insights their methodology offers compared to existing literature. We suggest minimizing claims about inauthenticity and focusing on coordination, as the evidence primarily supports this aspect. Clarifying the method for tuning thresholds in node and edge pruning would also strengthen the manuscript. Furthermore, please report the proportion of users classified as organic versus coordinated, and ensure that all references to tables and figures are accurate and consistent throughout the text.
