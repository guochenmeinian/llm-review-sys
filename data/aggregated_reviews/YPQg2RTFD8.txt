### Key Points
This paper presents Decoupled Mixup (DM), a new objective function with a decoupled regularizer designed to effectively utilize hard mixed samples and mine discriminative features in both supervised and semi-supervised learning. The authors argue that DM improves upon existing dynamic mixup methods by maintaining the original smoothness of mixup while reducing computational costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate DM's effectiveness across various tasks, including standard image classification and semi-supervised learning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The idea of harnessing hard mixed samples without compromising the smoothness of mixup is novel and interesting.
2. The proposed DM allows static mixup methods to achieve performance comparable to dynamic methods without additional computation.
3. The manuscript is well-motivated, with thorough empirical analyses and experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of DM.

Weaknesses:
1. Important notations are confusing and do not follow standard conventions, leading to potential misunderstandings.
2. Some sections, particularly Section 4.2, lack clarity and coherence, with abrupt transitions and poorly defined notations.
3. Certain equations are not numbered, and there are typographical errors present throughout the manuscript.
4. The relationship between DM and the smoothness of mixup is not adequately discussed, raising questions about the clarity of DM's mechanism.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of important notations by adhering to standard conventions. Additionally, we suggest revising Section 4.2 to enhance its coherence and contextual relevance, and providing a detailed explanation of Equation (2) to clarify its significance. The authors should also ensure that all equations are numbered and rectify typographical errors. Furthermore, we advise discussing the relationship between DM and the smoothness of mixup in greater detail to address potential contradictions. Lastly, consider re-evaluating the organization of sections related to transfer learning and semi-supervised learning for better logical flow.
