Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a watermarking method for images generated by diffusion models, embedding the watermark in the initial noise vector used during the generation process. The approach utilizes Fourier space patterns to ensure robustness against various image transformations. The authors propose a training-free method that eliminates concerns about domain shifts associated with pre-trained encoders and is easily implemented across all diffusion models. The watermark can be detected by reversing the diffusion process through DDIM Inversion, allowing for the retrieval of the noise vector and the embedded signal. The method is time-efficient, requiring only two additional Fourier transformations, and avoids the need for fine-tuning models for individual users.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is novel and operates by intervening in the sampling process rather than through post-hoc modifications, which is an attractive alternative to traditional watermarking techniques.
- The training-free nature of the approach mitigates domain shift issues and simplifies the process for multiple users by eliminating the need for individual model fine-tuning.
- The method appears straightforward to implement and does not require retraining of the diffusion model, with negligible additional processing time compared to state-of-the-art models.
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with solid experimental evaluations against reasonable watermarking baselines.

Weaknesses:
- The method is criticized for being impractical, as it does not provide clear advantages over existing image watermarking algorithms. Concerns include the modified initial noise not adhering to standard Gaussian distribution, impacting synthesis diversity and quality.
- The terminology used in the paper is inconsistent with watermarking literature, particularly the use of "fingerprint" instead of "watermark" and the term "invisible," which may be misleading.
- The claims regarding invisibility and detection limitations are disputed, as the differences between watermarked and non-watermarked images are visible.
- The experimental analysis lacks depth, particularly regarding the robustness of the watermark against multiple transformations and the capacity for multiple keys. Additionally, there are inconsistencies in the reported metrics, particularly regarding the use of L1 and L2 distances, and the statistical model for the detection threshold lacks clarity and empirical backing for the Gaussian distribution assumption.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the terminology used throughout the paper, particularly replacing "fingerprint" with "watermark" and reconsidering the use of "invisible" to avoid misleading implications. Additionally, the authors should provide precise definitions for the metrics used, particularly clarifying the use of magnitude in relation to Fourier coefficients. A more thorough discussion of the theoretical background and the implications of the modified initial noise on synthesis diversity and quality is necessary, including quantitative and qualitative experiments to support their claims. We also suggest revising the statistical model to ensure that the components of the key are truly iid Gaussian distributed, as this would enhance the robustness of the p-value calculations. Finally, we encourage the authors to include a comparison with recent watermarking schemes to contextualize the proposed method's performance and advantages, as well as clarifying the threat model and the userâ€™s role in the watermarking process.
