Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies dynamic algorithms for k-median and k-means in general metrics, presenting an \(\tilde{O}(k)\) update time and \(\tilde{O}(k^2)\) query time algorithm that achieves \(O(1)\)-approximation. The update model involves point insertion/deletion with access to a distance oracle. The authors improve upon the \(k^2\) update time of HK20 by employing a direct dynamization of MP04 rather than a coreset reduction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the new algorithm is faster and more accurate than HK20.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper achieves near-linear in \(k\) update time, a significant improvement over the previous \(k^2\) time.  
- The experiments convincingly justify the theoretical improvements.  
- A nearly-matching lower bound is provided, establishing the optimality of the update time.  

Weaknesses:  
- The algorithm only yields \(O(1)\)-approximation, while HK20 can build an \(\epsilon\)-coreset for general metrics, limiting generalization to the Euclidean case.  
- The query time remains \(k^2\), which may be improved.  
- The techniques heavily rely on the minimum ball coverage method by Mettu and Plaxton, and the challenges in achieving good update and query times are not well discussed.  
- The theoretical analysis is complex and could benefit from clearer exposition before the detailed proofs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the first paragraph in "our techniques" to better explain the \(k^2\) dependence in HK20. Additionally, a discussion on whether HK20 relies on a bi-criteria solution and its implications could provide valuable context. The authors should also clarify the algorithm for weighted k-median mentioned in Sec 1, as well as the procedure for converting the bi-criteria solution in Sec 3.1 into a feasible solution and its impact on time complexity. Finally, we suggest including a discussion of limitations and potential future directions to enhance the paper's comprehensiveness.
