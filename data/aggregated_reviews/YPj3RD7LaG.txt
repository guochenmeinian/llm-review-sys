### Key Points
This paper presents GraphControl, a deployment module designed to address the challenges of transferring pre-trained graph models to downstream tasks, particularly in graph-structured data. The authors propose a method that aligns input spaces across graphs and incorporates unique characteristics of target data as conditional inputs, effectively addressing the "transferability-specificity dilemma." Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphControl achieves significant performance improvements, with gains of 2-3x on datasets like Cora_ML and Amazon-Photo, and outperforms training-from-scratch methods by over 5% on certain datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The methodology is straightforward and clearly articulated, with a coherent presentation.
2. The experimental work is substantial, showcasing thorough analysis and discussions.
3. The proposed method enhances adaptability and exhibits faster convergence compared to training-from-scratch methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks significant innovative contributions despite employing established methods in transfer learning.
2. The experimental setup for baseline comparisons is not equitable, particularly regarding pre-training methods that omit node attributes.
3. There is a lack of detailed analysis for certain figures and experimental results, such as the smaller improvements observed in non-attributed datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on algorithms related to image-text diffusion, providing a dedicated section rather than a brief introduction. Additionally, conducting experiments on larger datasets would strengthen the findings, as the current datasets are relatively small. The authors should include a time and memory complexity analysis to clarify the efficiency of their method compared to existing approaches. Further explanation of the analysis regarding subsampling hyperparameters on Cora_ML would enhance the paper's clarity. Finally, addressing inconsistencies in mathematical notations and including additional baselines for attributed graphs in Table 2 would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method.
