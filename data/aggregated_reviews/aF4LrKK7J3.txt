### Key Points
This paper presents a study on an item acquiring problem involving an owner, a collector, and an appraiser. The owner knows the quality of items and aims to maximize the probability of their acquisition by the collector, who relies on potentially noisy evaluations from the appraiser. The authors propose truthful mechanism designs for both single and multi-item scenarios, analyzing their performance based on menu size and complementing theoretical findings with experimental results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a well-motivated and interesting problem, providing a coherent structure and a solid collection of results.
2. The mathematical rigor and clarity of writing are commendable, particularly in the theoretical analysis of the proposed mechanisms.

Weaknesses:
1. Certain sections of the paper exhibit inconsistent writing styles, particularly the abstract and contributions section, which may obscure the paper's main focus.
2. While the results are valuable, none stand out as particularly groundbreaking, which may affect the perceived significance of the contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and consistency of the writing throughout the paper, particularly in the abstract and contributions section. Additionally, consider addressing the assumptions regarding the independence of the appraiser and the implications of potential biases. We suggest providing a comparison of the proposed mechanisms with existing methods that address information asymmetry. Furthermore, exploring the possibility of allowing owners to report distributions over values could enhance the model's applicability and robustness.
