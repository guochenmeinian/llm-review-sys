### Key Points
This paper presents a cost-efficient solution for understanding precipitation formation processes through the development of four novel techniques: custom query strategy fusion, WiFi, MeFi, and SHAP-based feature selection, aimed at predicting autoconversion rates. The authors demonstrate that their approach consistently achieves excellent performance in autoconversion rate prediction while minimizing computational overhead, supported by extensive quantitative and qualitative experimental results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses the important challenge of understanding the climate system using high-resolution simulations in a cost-effective manner.
2. The proposed active learning techniques and query strategies efficiently predict autoconversion rates, reducing the need for labeled instances.
3. The introduction of SHAP-based feature selection is novel and specifically tailored for regression problems.
4. The experimental assessment is robust, featuring meticulous implementation, parameter configuration, and essential ablation studies.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks comparisons with widely known baselines, which would help to highlight the advantages and limitations of the proposed method.
2. There is insufficient analysis of the computational cost savings of the GPR model compared to the simulator, and the low-dimensional nature of the dataset limits the demonstration of the proposed algorithms' capabilities.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including comparisons with existing approaches in the field to illustrate the proposed method's performance relative to state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we suggest providing more insights into the limitations of the proposed method, particularly in scenarios where it may not perform well. A detailed analysis of the computational cost benefits of the GPR model against the simulator should also be included. Lastly, consider enhancing Figure 2 for clarity by presenting each individual feature combination with its own bar plot in each subfigure.
