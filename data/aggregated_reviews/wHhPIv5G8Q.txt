Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an online learning problem named LOCUD, aimed at detecting corrupted users from disrupted behaviors. The authors propose a novel bandit algorithm, RCLUB-WCU, and an online detection algorithm, OCCUD, which utilizes inferred user relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that these methods outperform previous bandit algorithms and achieve high accuracy in detecting corrupted users.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a relevant problem of identifying corrupt users in online environments, particularly for platforms like Amazon and Yelp.
2. The proposed framework effectively leverages user relations to enhance detection capabilities, supported by strong experimental results.
3. Theoretical analyses and guarantees regarding regret for the RCLUB-WCU/OCCUD algorithm are provided, enhancing the paper's rigor.

Weaknesses:
1. The introduction lacks sufficient emphasis on the motivation behind the proposed methods, requiring a more comprehensive analysis of current challenges in the field.
2. The abstract should be more concise, clearly highlighting key innovations.
3. Limited literature discussion weakens the methodology; a more extensive review of existing methods is necessary.
4. Experimental content is insufficient to convincingly demonstrate the method's superiority; additional dimensional experiments and analyses are recommended.
5. The dataset used is relatively small, limiting generalizability; a larger real dataset is recommended for validation.
6. The results in Table 1 regarding corrupted user detection lack clarity, particularly concerning precision and F1 scores.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by providing a more detailed motivation and context for their research. The abstract should be revised for conciseness and clarity regarding key innovations. To strengthen the methodology, we suggest including a more comprehensive literature review. Additionally, we advise the authors to conduct more extensive experiments with larger datasets and provide a clearer presentation of results, including precision and F1 scores in Table 1. Lastly, addressing the sensitivity of the proposed approach to parameter choices and discussing the impact of cluster sizes would enhance the paper's robustness.
