Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents GarmentLab, a comprehensive benchmark and realistic simulation designed for deformable object and garment manipulation. It includes the GarmentLab Engine, Assets, and Benchmark, facilitating various research topics and interactions among garments, rigid bodies, fluids, and human avatars. The authors propose several sim2real methods and extensive evaluations, marking it as a significant contribution to the community.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The framework supports a wide range of interactions and tasks, making it a versatile tool for garment manipulation research.
- The integration of sim2real algorithms, such as Teleoperation and Visual Sim-Real Alignment, enhances its applicability.
- The paper is well-organized and presents extensive evaluations.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the work is questionable, primarily focusing on engineering and benchmarking aspects.
- The paper lacks quantifiable comparisons regarding efficiency, such as speed and GPU memory usage.
- The real-world benchmark lacks detailed protocols for replication, which could hinder its usability in other labs.
- Certain figures, such as Figure 6, are not clearly interpretable, making it difficult for readers to understand the results.
- The absence of released code limits the assessment of the framework's quality and usability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Figure 6 to enhance interpretability. Additionally, providing more detailed protocols for the real-world benchmark will facilitate replication in other labs. We encourage the authors to release the code promptly, considering factors like user-friendly APIs and debugging tools to ensure the framework's adoption. Lastly, a thorough review for typos and inaccuracies, such as the error in Table 1 regarding PyBullet, is essential for improving the paper's quality.
