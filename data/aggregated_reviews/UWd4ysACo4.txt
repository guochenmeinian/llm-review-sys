Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel sign-equivariant model designed for spectral graph learning, specifically addressing the limitations of sign-invariant models in multi-node tasks. The authors provide theoretical analyses of the sign-equivariant polynomial space and propose a neural network architecture that guarantees sign-equivariance by design. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the model's superior performance in link prediction, particularly in the presence of automorphisms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-organized and easy to follow, effectively demonstrating the limitations of previous sign-invariant models and providing solid theoretical analyses.
2. The problem addressed is novel, with the authors mathematically supporting their claims regarding the inadequacies of sign-invariant models and the advantages of their proposed architecture.
3. The mathematical formulations are robust, with well-defined concepts of sign-equivariance and -invariance, and proven universality in the appendices.
4. The experiments conducted on graphs with high symmetries validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Weaknesses:
1. Proposition 1 lacks detail and requires further justification, particularly regarding the necessity of basis-invariance.
2. The limitations of the proposed architecture are not explicitly discussed, and the paper lacks empirical results on real-world datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the detail in Proposition 1 by providing a more thorough justification, especially concerning the necessity of basis-invariance. Additionally, the authors should explicitly discuss the limitations of their proposed architecture, particularly regarding efficiency and scalability, and include more empirical results on real-world datasets for link prediction and node clustering tasks. Furthermore, a comparison with recent works and a comprehensive table of baseline performances would enhance the paper's rigor.
