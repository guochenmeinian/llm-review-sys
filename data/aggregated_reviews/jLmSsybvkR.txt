Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a hierarchical conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) model that integrates Gaussian diffusion to address two significant issues in dialog generation: the posterior collapse problem and the limitations of Gaussian priors that restrict response diversity. The authors propose memory dropout to enhance the use of latent variables during training and demonstrate the model's effectiveness through experimental results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for the research is clear and strong.
- The proposed model shows competitive results against existing methods without relying on large-scale dialog pre-training.
- The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation on commonly-used open-domain dialog datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The integration of the diffusion process with CVAE training lacks clarity, with insufficient explanation of the dynamics governing the diffusion process and the co-training of diffusion latents.
- The evaluation methods employed are considered outdated, failing to adequately demonstrate the model's ability to generate fluent and diverse dialogues.
- There is a lack of comparative analysis regarding inference speed and parameter sizes against relevant baselines.
- The illustrations of the proposed techniques, particularly memory dropout, are unclear, making it difficult to assess their effectiveness in addressing the posterior collapse problem.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and thoroughness of the explanation regarding the integration of the diffusion process with CVAE training. A detailed exposition on the co-training dynamics and parameter tuning process is essential. Additionally, we suggest including a comparative analysis of inference speed and parameter sizes against relevant baselines, as well as updating the evaluation metrics to reflect current standards in dialog generation. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide more in-depth analysis and experimental validation of the memory dropout method's effectiveness in mitigating the posterior collapse problem.
