### Key Points
This paper presents GeoLM, a geospatially grounded language model pre-trained on text data that includes geo-entities, merging information from Wikipedia, Wikidata, and Open Street Map. The model employs masked language modeling and contrastive learning, evaluated across four downstream tasks related to geo-entity parsing. The authors demonstrate that GeoLM outperforms standard models like BERT and SpaBERT in these tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and clearly motivated, addressing a significant problem in geospatial language understanding.
- Experimental results show that GeoLM achieves improved performance compared to existing models, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation lacks clarity on whether compared models were fine-tuned on specific downstream tasks, particularly in toponym recognition and disambiguation.
- There are no ablation studies to justify the effectiveness of individual components, such as the use of verbalized sentences and coordinate embeddings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding the fine-tuning of compared models in Sections 3.1, 3.3, and 3.4. Additionally, the authors should conduct ablation studies to assess the contributions of various components, including the contrastive objective and geographic embeddings. Detailed explanations of the trie-based phrase matching and the combination of pre-training tasks should be included in Section 2.2 and 2.3. Furthermore, the evaluation of toponym recognition and linking should incorporate comparisons against benchmarks like EUPEG and other relevant systems. Lastly, the authors should clarify the relation extraction task and ensure that the distribution of geo-entities is well-documented.
