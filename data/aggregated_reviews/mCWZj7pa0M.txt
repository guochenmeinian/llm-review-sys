Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a mathematical framework for stochastic spiking neural networks (SSNNs) modeled as stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with event discontinuities. The authors establish sufficient conditions for the existence of gradients and introduce Marcus signature kernels to define a general-purpose loss function for training SSNNs as generative models. The framework leverages rough path theory to accommodate jumps in solution trajectories and driving noise, providing an algorithm for parameter estimation in a toy example.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper offers a mathematically rigorous framework that generalizes previous results by modeling SSNNs with event discontinuities and cadlag rough paths.  
- It identifies conditions for the existence of gradients, enabling gradient-based training of SSNNs with noise in both spike timing and dynamics.  
- The writing is generally clear, making complex material accessible, and it discusses connections to bio-plausible learning algorithms.  

Weaknesses:  
- The empirical validation is limited to simple toy examples, lacking application to realistic datasets or standard SNN benchmarks, which diminishes the practical impact of the proposed method.  
- The use of specialized jargon and mathematical assumptions may alienate readers unfamiliar with the terminology, hindering broader comprehension and engagement with the relevant communities.  
- The paper does not sufficiently address the computational complexity of the proposed EventSDESolve algorithm or its scalability with respect to the number of parameters.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical validation by applying their framework to standard SNN benchmarks, such as the yin yang dataset, to demonstrate practical effectiveness. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the use of jargon and mathematical assumptions to enhance accessibility for a wider audience. It would be beneficial to discuss the computational complexity of the EventSDESolve algorithm in detail, including how it scales with the number of parameters and its feasibility for real datasets. Finally, we encourage the authors to address the assumptions made in their analysis more thoroughly to assess their applicability in common conditions.
