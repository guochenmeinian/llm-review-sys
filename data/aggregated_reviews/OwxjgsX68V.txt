Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new text augmentation technique, CASSI (Contextual and Semantic Structure-based Interpolation), aimed at enhancing low-resource Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks. The authors propose a method that generates candidate augmentations through subtree exchanges, utilizing dependency parsing, and filters these candidates based on language model scoring and Jaccard similarity. The paper demonstrates CASSI's superior performance compared to existing methods like DAGA and MELM across various NER settings, particularly in low-resource and cross-lingual contexts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed technique is novel and effectively addresses challenges in low-resource NER settings.
- The experimental setup is robust, with comprehensive evaluations in both monolingual and cross-lingual scenarios.
- The method generates fluent and contextually diverse text while maintaining annotation integrity.
- The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear explanations addressing potential doubts.

Weaknesses:
- Claims regarding "high-quality" and "contextual diversity" are not quantitatively substantiated.
- The method's effectiveness has not been demonstrated in few-shot cross-domain NER settings.
- Some filtering steps, such as the use of Jaccard similarity, may inadvertently reduce diversity by favoring more similar sentences.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definition of "k" in Section 3.2.1 to ensure readers understand its significance. Additionally, we suggest that the authors quantify the naturalness and diversity of the augmented sentences to substantiate their claims of high quality and contextual diversity. Exploring efficiency improvements for the various steps in CASSI would also enhance its applicability to larger datasets. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the role of Jaccard similarity in the filtering process to address potential concerns about its impact on diversity.
