Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the ability of transformers to implement higher-order optimization methods for in-context learning (ICL) in linear regression tasks. The authors demonstrate that transformers converge to the ordinary least squares (OLS) solution at a rate similar to that of iterative Newton's method, contrasting with the slower convergence of gradient descent (GD). They provide empirical evidence and a theoretical construction showing that a transformer can implement a polynomial-sized version of Newton's iterative algorithm.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work enhances understanding of how transformers efficiently solve linear regression problems, particularly in ill-conditioned scenarios.
- The paper establishes that transformers may serve as superior algorithmic engines compared to other models, such as LSTMs.
- The empirical results indicate that the representations learned by transformers closely mimic the updates of higher-order algorithms.
- The experiments are well-executed, and the theoretical contributions are clearly articulated.

Weaknesses:
- The findings are primarily based on noiseless linear regression tasks, raising questions about their generalizability to noisy settings or other types of learning tasks.
- There is a lack of direct evidence that transformers are learning a higher-order algorithm, with some empirical results appearing to contradict this theory.
- The mismatch between theoretical expectations and empirical results, particularly regarding the required number of layers for the proposed construction, is concerning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by conducting experiments on non-linear regression tasks and exploring the behavior of transformers in the presence of noise. Additionally, clarifying the distinction between their results and those of previous works, such as Garg et al. (2022), would strengthen the paper's contributions. Addressing the concerns regarding the empirical and theoretical mismatch, particularly the implications of the required eight-layer baseline, would also enhance the robustness of their claims.
