Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the "importance weighted samples gradient (IWSG)" estimator and its integration into a "mixture density particle filter (MDPF)" for state space architectures. The authors propose a discriminative approach that eliminates the need for a generative model, yielding unbiased and low-variance gradient estimates, unlike traditional particle filters. The paper reviews existing methods, highlights their limitations, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach through extensive experiments across various state estimation tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an important topic in particle-based estimation, providing a clear context and motivation for the proposed methods.
- It offers a thorough review of related discriminative particle filters and identifies their weaknesses, justifying the need for IWSG and MDPF.
- The proposed methods effectively tackle challenges such as differentiation through resampling and high-variance gradient estimates, with experiments showing superior performance against relevant baselines.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation is often confusing, with a lack of clarity in the organization of content, making it difficult to follow the narrative.
- Figures are poorly designed, with small font sizes and insufficient context, hindering comprehension of critical information.
- The paper does not adequately clarify the relationship between IWSG and prior estimators, nor does it provide direct evidence for claims regarding the unbiased nature of MDPF gradients.
- The evaluation is limited to low-dimensional problems, and the training setup may not reflect real-world scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by streamlining the narrative and clearly distinguishing between technical background, contributions, and related work. Additionally, the figures should be redesigned for better readability and comprehension. We suggest providing a more detailed explanation of the relationship between IWSG and previous estimators, along with empirical evidence supporting claims of unbiased gradient estimates. Furthermore, expanding the evaluation to include higher-dimensional problems and real-world datasets would strengthen the paper's contributions. Lastly, addressing the limitations of the training setup and discussing the implications of using unsupervised learning in differentiable particle filters would enhance the overall robustness of the findings.
