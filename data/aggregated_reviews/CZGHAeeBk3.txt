### Key Points
This paper presents methods to incorporate symmetry invariance into Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) during training. The authors propose symmetrization through group averaging or canonical forms for symmetric states, and suggest direct isomorphism testing or efficient approximations with positional encodings for symmetric actions. Experiments on synthetic data validate these techniques, demonstrating improved sample efficiency and accuracy. The work delves into the structure of GFlowNets and addresses the important issue of symmetry, which may also be relevant for other generative modeling scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is clearly written and contributes significantly to improving GFlowNets by addressing symmetries.  
- The proposed techniques for imposing state and action invariance are methodical and intuitive, with experiments providing clear validation of benefits.  
- The systematic description of the symmetry incorporation scheme is comprehensive and accessible to a broader audience.  

Weaknesses:  
- The focus on graphs with a maximum of 7 nodes may limit practical applicability; a detailed explanation for this choice is needed.  
- While benchmarking against the original paper's conceptual example is reasonable, including an additional practical example would strengthen the argument.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation regarding the choice of graphs with a maximum of 7 nodes to clarify its practical relevance. Additionally, we suggest that the authors include one more practical example for benchmarking to enhance the convincingness of their results.
