### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation of no-regret learning algorithms in harmonic games, contrasting with the more commonly studied potential games. The authors demonstrate that continuous-time FTRL dynamics are Poincaré recurrent and do not converge, while discrete-time FTRL can lead to perpetual cycles of best responses. By incorporating an extrapolation step (FTRL+), the authors show that learning can achieve Nash equilibrium from any initial point, ensuring constant regret and providing significant insights into harmonic games.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper offers a novel exploration of no-regret learning in harmonic games, which are less frequently examined than potential games. The introduction of FTRL+ to ensure convergence is a creative enhancement of existing algorithms. The result regarding Poincaré recurrence in Theorem 2 is insightful, and the clarity of the statements and proofs enhances the paper's rigor.

Weaknesses:  
The empirical results could benefit from examples beyond the matching pennies scenario. The proofs are somewhat dense and may be difficult to follow. Additionally, a clearer differentiation from the work by Legacci et al. would strengthen the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical analysis by including a broader range of harmonic game examples. Clarifying the definitions and implications of parameters $\lambda_i$ and $\eta_i$ in relation to the performance of the FTRL+ algorithm would also be beneficial. It would be helpful to cite relevant literature, such as the work by Daskalakis et al., to contextualize the significance of the results. Furthermore, addressing minor comments regarding notation and definitions in the main body could enhance readability and comprehension.
