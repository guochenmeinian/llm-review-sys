### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to AI alignment by adjusting unaligned model output at the emotional level rather than the linguistic level. The authors propose that connecting emotional states to linguistic outputs can enhance transparency in AI behavior. However, the paper raises concerns about the implications of defining "acceptable" emotions and the potential for distorted representations of human experiences. The authors highlight the limitations of existing methods like RLHF and introduce a complementary approach involving sentiment analysis and adversarial techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The authors effectively argue that techniques such as RLHF can lead to models forgetting their optimal answers while adapting to human preferences. The proposed method separates behavior modeling from knowledge representation, enhancing transparency and interpretability. The inclusion of adversarial components like ERIC allows for adaptation to cultural contexts, which is crucial for addressing global ethical standards. The pilot testing on love letters demonstrates the framework's application.

Weaknesses:  
The approach may be vulnerable to manipulation, as reliance on emotions could lead to undesirable behaviors that are not easily detectable. The authors should expand their evaluation dataset to include ethically challenging contexts such as hate speech and misinformation. Additionally, more technical details on ERIS are needed, particularly regarding its training, evaluation, and integration with DIKE. Concerns about scalability, including computational resources and latency during inference, should also be addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve their defense of the implications surrounding the concept of "acceptable" emotions, as this is a critical aspect of their approach. Additionally, consider expanding the evaluation dataset to include more ethically challenging contexts to enhance the robustness of findings. We also suggest providing more technical details on ERIS, including its training and integration with DIKE. Finally, please discuss the scalability of the proposed solution, particularly regarding computational resources and any performance overhead during inference.
