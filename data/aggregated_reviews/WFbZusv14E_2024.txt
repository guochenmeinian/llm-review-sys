Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the planning capabilities of transformer-based language models by framing planning as a network path-finding task. The authors analyze the model's ability to learn reachability and adjacency matrices, revealing that while transformers can embed these matrices, they struggle with transitivity in reachability, which limits their effectiveness in complex planning scenarios. The theoretical insights are supported by experimental validations using synthetic and real-world datasets, including the Blocksworld benchmark.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant problem crucial for advancing the field.
- The experimental setup is straightforward yet effective.
- The authors approach the topic from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, enriching the study.

Weaknesses:
- There is a lack of logical connections among the introduction, theory, and experiments, particularly regarding the broad question of how next-word prediction generates intelligence.
- The clarity of writing needs improvement, with vague references such as "Project ALPINE" in the introduction.
- The paper does not adequately justify why the transformer architecture fails to infer unobserved reachability, and the introduction lacks a clear motivation for the investigation.
- The experimental results are limited to specific datasets, and broader validation across diverse planning datasets is necessary.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction to provide a clearer motivation for the investigation and articulate why it is reasonable to question what the transformer is learning. Additionally, enhancing the clarity of writing throughout the paper, particularly in defining terms and concepts, would be beneficial. We suggest exploring broader experimental setups to validate the findings across diverse planning scenarios. Lastly, addressing the theoretical implications of the inability to learn unobserved reachabilities would strengthen the paper's contributions.
