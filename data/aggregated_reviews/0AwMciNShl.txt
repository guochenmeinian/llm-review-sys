Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Text-to-Video Human Evaluation (T2VHE) protocol, a standardized framework for evaluating text-to-video (T2V) models. It includes well-defined metrics, annotator training resources, and a dynamic evaluation module that reduces annotation costs by approximately 50%. The authors conduct a comprehensive evaluation of several prominent T2V models across different prompt categories, revealing significant findings regarding model performance and the importance of class-wide prompts in human evaluation protocols. They employ the Rao and Kupper model for robust ranking of models based on pairwise comparisons and emphasize the need to distinguish between subjective and objective metrics to minimize biases in human evaluations while retaining annotator diversity. The authors commit to open-sourcing the evaluation process and code.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The T2VHE protocol provides a comprehensive and consistent framework for evaluating T2V models, facilitating fair comparisons.
- The dynamic evaluation module significantly reduces annotation costs while maintaining quality.
- The framework effectively incorporates detailed training processes for annotators, enhancing consistency in evaluations.
- The use of bootstrap confidence intervals and the Rao and Kupper model ensures reliable ranking estimates even with incomplete data.
- The experimental design demonstrates a thorough analysis of model performance across multiple prompt categories, with high-performing models like Gen2 showing robust results.

Weaknesses:
- The performance and stability of the algorithm may vary with different prompt types and model characteristics, with lower-performing models showing less pronounced impacts from prompt categories.
- The evaluation metrics lack clarity regarding their completeness and independence, particularly concerning "Video Quality" and "Temporal Quality."
- The authors do not sufficiently compare their protocol with existing evaluation methods, limiting the quantification of improvements.
- Potential biases in the dynamic evaluation module and the reliance on manual A/B testing raise concerns about consistency in human preferences.
- The reliance on manual work in the dynamic evaluation component may limit its ease of use in the open-source community.
- Some technical aspects, such as the handling of ties in evaluations, may require further clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and justification of the evaluation metrics to ensure they are comprehensive and independent. Specifically, they should address the relationship between "Temporal Quality" and "Motion Quality" and provide a detailed explanation of how the Rao and Kupper model quantifies metrics, particularly in relation to handling ties. Additionally, we suggest that the authors include comparisons with existing evaluation protocols to better demonstrate the advantages of their approach. It would also be beneficial to conduct a thorough error analysis to identify cases where the protocol may fail or produce inconsistent results. We encourage the authors to enhance the transparency of the dynamic evaluation module's bias-handling mechanisms in the main text, rather than solely in supplementary materials. Finally, we suggest further exploration of how the dynamic evaluation component can be streamlined to reduce dependency on manual work, thereby increasing its accessibility for the open-source community.
