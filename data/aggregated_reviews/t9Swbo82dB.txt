Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Fine-Grained Reward Maximization (FGRM) framework aimed at improving uncertainty estimation in deep segmentation models for safety-critical applications. The authors propose a reinforcement learning-based model tuning paradigm that utilizes a custom reward function linked to uncertainty metrics, employing the Fisher information matrix for parameter updates. The framework distinguishes between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty through evidential pre-training. Experimental results on two surgical datasets demonstrate that FGRM enhances uncertainty estimation for both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data without compromising segmentation performance. Additionally, the authors compare their FGRM method with the learned heteroscedastic uncertainty (LHU) method and the auxiliary feature method on LC and ESD segmentation datasets, showing that FGRM consistently outperforms both methods across various evaluation metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-motivated and presents a clear application of the Fisher information matrix and evidential learning, with a novel fine-grained update mechanism.
2. The presentation is clear and logically organized, making it accessible to a broad audience.
3. Empirical results show significant improvements over baseline methods, and the authors provide a comprehensive comparison with established techniques, showcasing superior performance metrics.
4. The inclusion of additional tests on ESD surgical data and improved visualizations enhances the clarity and impact of the results.
5. The authors effectively address reviewer concerns and refine their terminology regarding the RL framework.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks theoretical insights into FGRM, such as uncertainty bounds, which are crucial in the context of uncertainty estimation.
2. The experimental section contains ambiguities, particularly regarding the evaluation metrics and comparisons with auxiliary network-based methods.
3. The terminology surrounding the RL framework may still lead to confusion, as the actions do not affect the state of the system.
4. The application scope appears limited to medical imaging, which may restrict broader applicability.
5. The paper could benefit from clearer framing of the contribution to improve understanding for future readers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical framework by providing insights into uncertainty bounds for FGRM. Additionally, clarify the evaluation metrics used in the experiments and ensure that comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, particularly those tailored for medical image segmentation, are included. We suggest that the authors improve the clarity of their terminology by rephrasing the uncertainty estimation problem as a reward optimization process solved using RL algorithms, rather than framing it as a complete RL system. It would also be beneficial to justify the use of OOD data in the experiments and to provide uncertainty maps for better interpretability of results. Lastly, consider expanding the application scope beyond medical imaging to enhance the generalizability of the proposed method.
