Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an autoencoder-like nonnegative matrix co-factorization framework (AE-NMCF) aimed at enhancing predictions of student exercise performance and assessments of knowledge proficiency, particularly in scenarios with sparse data. The authors propose a projected gradient method utilizing block coordinate descent and Lipschitz constants, ensuring theoretical convergence for parameter estimation. The effectiveness of AE-NMCF is validated through experiments on multiple real-world datasets, demonstrating its superiority over existing cognitive models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with a solid theoretical analysis of the proposed projected-gradient algorithm.
- The authors employ a sufficient number of datasets and baselines for empirical validation, yielding promising results.

Weaknesses:
- The justification for the proposed factorization form is lacking.
- The matrix parameter B complicates parameter estimation due to its large size (N x K).
- The objective function appears inappropriate from a probabilistic modeling perspective, as it redundantly incorporates the same data X.
- The authors do not perform ablation studies to substantiate claims regarding the advantages of co-factorization over existing methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing and presentation throughout the paper, addressing complex sentence structures and vague claims. It would be beneficial to provide more background and motivation in the introduction, clarifying the context and applications of cognitive modeling. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the figures to better illustrate the mechanics of the model and the interactions between matrices. To strengthen the paper, we advise conducting ablation studies to validate the specific contributions of co-factorization and other model components to performance gains. Lastly, please clarify the plans for publicly releasing the code to support reproducibility.
