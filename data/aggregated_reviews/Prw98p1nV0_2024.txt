Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the parameter update mechanism of interactive teaching, specifically through co-teaching, and proposes an understanding based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The authors utilize Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) to optimize interactive teaching from the perspective of the loss landscape. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments across multiple datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The authors provide a cohesive logical framework with a clear structure, making the paper easy to follow.  
- The integration of SAM with co-teaching is well-explained, and the experiments conducted across five datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements.  

Weaknesses:  
- The experimental section lacks clarity regarding the relationship between baselines, with limited exploration of other methods like JoCoR and CNLCU.  
- The choice of co-teaching as the sole backbone raises questions about its representativeness.  
- The description of the E-step update in Proposition 4.1 is unclear, and the assumptions made in the probabilistic model need further justification.  
- The computational cost of the proposed method is notably high, with Co-teaching + SAM requiring more than double the time of Co-teaching alone.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental section by detailing the relationships between the baselines and justifying the choice of co-teaching as the primary method. Additionally, we suggest providing a more concise explanation of Proposition 4.1 and addressing the assumptions made regarding the latent variable distribution. To mitigate concerns regarding computational costs, we encourage the authors to include a time cost ablation study comparing their method to Co-teaching and other NLL methods, as well as exploring techniques like low-rank matrix decomposition to reduce complexity.
