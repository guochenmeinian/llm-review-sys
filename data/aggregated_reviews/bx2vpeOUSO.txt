### Key Points
This paper presents a well-organized website serving as an AI resource hub with curated modules and resources. However, it raises questions about its novelty and research contribution, appearing more as a compilation and resource curation effort than a research endeavor aimed at addressing specific problems. The focus on describing a system may be better suited to a system description paper rather than a research paper. Additionally, while the paper has merits, it lacks novelty from the machine learning (ML) perspective, though it has the potential to inspire new viewpoints in the field.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The website is well-organized and serves as a comprehensive AI resource hub.  
- It has the potential to inspire new viewpoints in the ML community.

Weaknesses:  
- The work lacks novelty and appears more as a compilation than a research contribution.  
- The current draft is vague and does not effectively communicate its relevance to the ML community.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their work by addressing specific research challenges, proposing new methodologies, or providing empirical results to support their claims. Additionally, to enhance communication with the ML community, the authors should include an abstraction of the problem that can be translated into more ML language, such as defining conformation generation as learning $p(x)$, providing basic statistics of the datasets, and including more examples.
