Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ROCLIP, a robust pre-training method for multimodal vision-language models that effectively addresses targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks. Instead of relying on exact image-caption pairs, ROCLIP matches images with the most similar captions from a large pool, thereby disassociating poisoned pairs. The authors demonstrate through comprehensive experiments that ROCLIP significantly reduces the success rates of these attacks and enhances linear probe performance while maintaining similar zero-shot performance. Furthermore, ROCLIP effectively defends against high poison ratios (0.5-1%) and counters a new backdoor attack, significantly outperforming existing defense techniques designed for fine-tuning. The authors provide experimental evaluations on pretraining with smaller datasets, specifically using 50K and 100K examples, to validate ROCLIP's effectiveness and express a need for suitable specialized image-caption datasets for further training and experimentation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method is novel and employs a simple yet effective strategy to enhance robustness against backdoor attacks.
2. ROCLIP shows robust defense capabilities against high poison ratios and new backdoor attacks.
3. The method outperforms existing fine-tuning defense techniques, indicating its effectiveness.
4. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
5. Extensive experiments validate ROCLIP's effectiveness in defending against poisoning attacks and address previous concerns.

Weaknesses:
1. Some details, such as the threat model, are not clearly defined, which could enhance clarity.
2. The paper lacks discussion on adaptive defenses against potential adversaries aware of ROCLIP.
3. Evaluation is limited to low poison ratios; the effectiveness of ROCLIP under varying poison ratios is not thoroughly explored.
4. The explanation of Eq. 1 is unclear, leading to confusion regarding its components.
5. The authors have not identified suitable datasets for specialized multimodal learning, which limits further validation of their method.
6. There is uncertainty regarding which specific concerns remain unaddressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the threat model and explicitly define terms such as "NN caption." Additionally, the authors should discuss the potential for adaptive attacks against ROCLIP and evaluate its performance under higher poison ratios. Clarifying the explanation of Eq. 1 would also benefit readers. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors identify and utilize specialized image-caption datasets for pretraining to enhance the validation of ROCLIP's effectiveness in multimodal learning contexts. Lastly, clarifying which concerns are still outstanding would help address reviewer feedback more comprehensively.
