### Key Points
This paper presents a Sampling Period Perturbation Algorithm (SPPA) aimed at ensuring local differential privacy (LDP) protection in time series data with temporal relevance. The authors define several concepts, including ϵ-Temporal Indistinguishability and (ϵ,w,τ)-Event LDP, and propose a single-window perturbator. Experimental results indicate that SPPA outperforms existing methods like ETM and PeGaSus. However, the paper contains contradictions and areas of confusion, particularly regarding the protection of timestamps and the assumption that time series data can be modeled as d=f(t).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Theoretical analysis and proofs are robust.
2. Significant improvements over state-of-the-art algorithms are demonstrated through experimental evaluations.
3. Novel privacy notions tailored to temporal data are introduced.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks proper formatting according to the template.
2. Practical deployment challenges, such as computational overhead, are not fully explored.
3. The assumption that time series data can be represented as d=f(t) is overly simplistic and does not account for inherent randomness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how the proposed model protects timestamps, particularly given that the SPPA does not introduce delays. Additionally, the authors should reconsider the assumption that time series data can be modeled as d=f(t), providing more realistic examples or applications that validate this approach. It would also be beneficial to compare SPPA with more recent VLDP methods to enhance the relevance of the analysis. Furthermore, the authors should address practical deployment challenges, including computational resource requirements and the robustness of SPPA against adversaries with advanced temporal knowledge. Lastly, including a diagram to illustrate the methodology and providing explicit details about the privacy budget settings in the experimental results would enhance transparency and comprehension.
