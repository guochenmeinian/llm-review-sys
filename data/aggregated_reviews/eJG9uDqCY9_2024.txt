Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a formal investigation of the concept of transcendence, where generative models trained on expert data can outperform those experts. The authors propose a theoretical framework demonstrating that low-temperature sampling is essential for achieving transcendence, validated through experiments with transformer models trained on chess game datasets. Key findings include the effectiveness of low-temperature sampling in enhancing model performance and the importance of dataset diversity for achieving transcendence.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel concept of transcendence in generative models, supported by rigorous theoretical proofs and extensive empirical validation in the chess domain.
- The choice of chess as a testbed allows for targeted experiments and clear presentation of results.
- The paper is well-structured and effectively communicates its findings.

Weaknesses:
- The empirical validation is limited to chess, raising questions about the generalizability of the findings to other domains.
- The theoretical framework relies on simplifying assumptions that may not hold in real-world scenarios.
- Key connections, such as between majority voting and low-temperature sampling, require more formal proof.
- The paper contains several typos and inaccuracies that detract from clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical section by integrating proofs and clarifying the assumptions underlying Theorem 2. Additionally, we suggest providing a toy model to explore the conditions under which transcendence can occur. To enhance clarity, please address the identified typos and inaccuracies throughout the paper. Finally, consider discussing the practical implications and future research directions more thoroughly, particularly regarding the applicability of transcendence beyond chess.
