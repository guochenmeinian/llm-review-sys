Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Multi-Modal Inverse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (MMICRL) algorithm, which addresses the challenge of recovering multiple constraints from a mixture of expert trajectories. The algorithm employs a flow-based density estimator for unsupervised expert identification and infers agent-specific constraints, optimizing a multi-modal policy that balances conditioned and unconditioned policy entropy. Experimental results demonstrate that MMICRL outperforms baseline algorithms in both discrete and continuous environments regarding constraint recovery and control performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The problem of multi-modal learning from a mixture of experts with constraints is significant and challenging, and MMICRL includes necessary components to address these difficulties.  
- The writing is clear, with intuitive explanations accompanying the mathematical notations.  
- Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MMICRL across various environments, showing significant improvements over baseline methods.  

Weaknesses:  
- Some aspects of the paper remain confusing, particularly regarding detailed design choices and specific propositions.  
- The algorithm's performance is only demonstrated with a limited number of agent types, raising concerns about its scalability to more complex scenarios.  
- The evaluation settings lack realism, as the paper does not apply the method to real-world data, which could enhance the quality of the evaluation.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by addressing the confusing elements noted in the Questions section, particularly regarding proposition 4.2 and the conditions for the statement. Additionally, we suggest including constraint violation rates in Table 2 for expert demonstration data and clarifying whether the demonstration data has a zero violation rate. It would also be beneficial to test the method on more realistic datasets, such as vehicle driving scenarios, to demonstrate its applicability in real-world contexts. Finally, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the theoretical aspects of the algorithm, including its convergence properties and robustness to incorrect agent class assumptions.
