Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the PromptRestorer, a method for image restoration that effectively utilizes raw degradation features extracted from a pre-trained model to guide the restoration process. The architecture comprises a restoration branch and a prompting branch, where the latter perceives degradation priors to enhance restoration accuracy. The authors introduce the prompting degradation perception modulator (PromptDMP) and gated degradation perception propagation (GDP) to simplify the restoration task by avoiding the need for additional knowledge from external data distributions. They assert that PromptRestorer achieves state-of-the-art performance across four tasks: deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and desnowing, claiming that their method is more effective than existing learnable conditional modulation techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The innovative use of intermediate layer features from pre-trained models enhances image restoration effectiveness.
- The proposed method effectively utilizes raw degradation features, leading to better restoration outcomes.
- The introduction of PromptDMP and GDP offers a structured approach to perceiving degradation from both global and local perspectives.
- The experimental validation is comprehensive, showcasing diverse tasks and clear comparative figures that highlight the framework's distinctiveness.
- The writing is professional, and the proposed methods are novel and effective.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for the prompting degradation perception modulator is inadequately articulated, lacking quantifiable metrics and robust literature support.
- The introduction of local and global prompting attention lacks clarity regarding their impact on existing shortcomings.
- The performance improvements appear modest compared to previous methods, and the paper does not adequately discuss limitations or the implications of increased network parameters and FLOPS.
- The comparative experiments lack rigor, particularly regarding the initialization of models, which undermines the claims of superiority over learnable methods.
- The argument that the pre-trained VQGAN does not involve knowledge transfer from other data is contested and lacks sufficient evidence.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the articulation of the motivation behind the prompting degradation perception modulator and provide a thorough analysis of existing methods' deficiencies. Additionally, a clearer explanation of the local and global prompting attention components is necessary. We suggest improving the experimental design by initializing both Case 2 and Case 3 with pre-trained weights to ensure a fair comparison. Furthermore, the authors should conduct more comprehensive experiments to validate their claims regarding the effectiveness of the NOT learnable conditional network and clarify the role of the pre-trained model in their approach. Addressing the concerns regarding potential knowledge transfer from the VQGAN is also essential. Finally, we encourage the authors to include results on blind image denoising in the revised paper to strengthen their findings and discuss the limitations of their approach, providing evidence supporting claims about the effectiveness of raw degradation features over learnable parameters.
