Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Frequency Adversarial Training (FAT), a method aimed at enhancing the robustness of 3D point cloud recognition models against various corruptions by utilizing adversarial examples generated in the frequency domain. The authors leverage the Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) to analyze the sensitivity of models to different frequency bands of corruptions, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness through extensive experiments. The theoretical analysis provided supports the effectiveness of FAT in improving out-of-distribution generalization performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, presenting a novel concept of frequency augmentation for 3D point cloud data.
2. The innovative use of frequency domain analysis through GFT is well-motivated and contributes significantly to the field.
3. Comprehensive evaluation of FAT shows its effectiveness across multiple models and datasets, supported by both theoretical and empirical validation.
4. The writing quality is high, and the extensive experiments clearly demonstrate the positive impact of FAT on model robustness.

Weaknesses:
1. The caption of Figure 3 is misleading regarding the Jacobian matrix, which should refer to the model rather than the input point cloud.
2. There is a lack of comparisons with other adversarial training techniques, limiting the evaluation of FAT against a broader range of methods.
3. The figures are hard to read due to small font sizes, and there are minor formatting issues in the captions.
4. The paper primarily utilizes synthetic datasets like ModelNet40, which may not convincingly demonstrate real-world applicability; additional experiments on real-world datasets such as KITTI are necessary.
5. The complexity of FAT may hinder its practical adoption, and the paper does not adequately address the trade-off between corruption robustness and standard accuracy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Figure 3 by correcting the caption to accurately describe the Jacobian matrix. Additionally, the authors should include comparisons with other adversarial training techniques to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of FAT. Enhancing the readability of figures by increasing font sizes and addressing minor formatting issues would also be beneficial. To strengthen the paper's applicability to real-world scenarios, we suggest conducting experiments on real-world datasets such as KITTI. Finally, the authors should provide a detailed discussion on the complexity and efficiency of FAT to address concerns regarding its practical implementation.
