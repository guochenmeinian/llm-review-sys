Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DeepACO, a framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to automate the design of heuristics for Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithms. The authors propose a method that enhances the heuristic measures of existing ACO algorithms, eliminating the need for extensive manual design. DeepACO demonstrates significant performance improvements across eight combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) and shows competitive results against specialized Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) methods. The paper is well-organized and clearly written.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
**S1.** The integration of deep reinforcement learning into ACO represents a novel approach, marking a significant contribution to the field.  
**S2.** DeepACO consistently outperforms traditional ACO methods across multiple COPs, indicating its effectiveness.  
**S3.** The comprehensive experimental design and results support the claims made regarding DeepACO's performance.

Weaknesses:  
**W1.** The comparison with existing NCOs is limited to TSP500 and TSP1000, making it difficult to assert state-of-the-art performance; broader comparative experiments are needed.  
**W2.** Section 4.2 lacks detail on the neural-guided perturbation, including the neural network structure and its learning and inference processes.  
**W3.** The paper does not adequately discuss its novelty compared to previous frameworks, such as the data-driven Heuristics Schedule in MILP solvers.  
**W4.** Generalization results are necessary to demonstrate DeepACO's applicability to larger instances and a wider range of problems.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison of DeepACO with a broader set of NCOs by including additional tasks such as CVRP 500/1000 or TSP 100/CVRP 100. We also suggest providing more comprehensive details about the neural-guided perturbation in Section 4.2, including the neural network's structure and its learning and inference processes. Additionally, the authors should clarify the novelty of their work in relation to existing frameworks and present generalization results to strengthen the claims of DeepACO's applicability across diverse problem sets.
