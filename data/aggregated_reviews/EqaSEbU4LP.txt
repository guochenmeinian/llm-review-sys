### Key Points
This paper presents WikiDO, a new benchmark dataset aimed at evaluating the out-of-domain (OOD) generalization capability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in cross-modal retrieval tasks. The dataset comprises 384K image-text pairs from Wikipedia, featuring domain labels and both in-distribution (ID) and OOD test sets of size 3K each. The authors evaluate popular models, including CLIP and BLIP, demonstrating the limitations of existing benchmarks like MSCOCO and Flickr.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The benchmark is well-motivated, clearly constructed, and effectively evaluated against recent baselines.
- The dataset's large scale (384K image-text pairs) and the validation of distribution discrepancies from multiple perspectives enhance its utility.
- The writing quality is high, making the motivation and contributions of WikiDO clear.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset has limited topics, with the OOD test set covering only three topics, which may not adequately represent OOD performance across general topics.
- The experimental results are restricted to only CLIP and BLIP models, lacking evaluations of additional VLMs.
- The dataset splits for ID and OOD are fixed, and there are no reports on OOD performance with alternative combinations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset by expanding the number of topics to better represent OOD performance across general topics. Additionally, we suggest including results from a broader range of VLMs in the experimental evaluation. To enhance the visualization of Figure 3, consider introducing a random drawing order, increasing the transparency rate, and reducing the number of dots through random sampling. Finally, we encourage the authors to add scripts for automatically updating the leaderboard and to provide code for replicating baseline results.
