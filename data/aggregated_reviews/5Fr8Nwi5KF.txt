### Key Points
This paper presents a probabilistic model, DDMSL (Discrete Diffusion Model for Source Localization), aimed at tracing the origin and path of information diffusion in complex networks, particularly in contexts like epidemics and rumors. The authors utilize Markov chains and a reversible residual network to achieve source localization and reconstruct diffusion paths, with extensive testing on five real-world datasets demonstrating the model's efficacy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The topic is engaging, addressing source localization under SI and SIR propagation patterns.
- The proposed methods are theoretically sound and supported by rigorous proofs.
- The writing is generally clear, and the experiments show that DDMSL outperforms existing baselines.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for recovering diffusion paths is weak; source localization may suffice with just seed node identification.
- The claim regarding uncertainty quantification in source localization is questionable, as the proposed method appears deterministic.
- Efficiency concerns arise from the step-wise diffusion model, with a lack of runtime analysis and complexity demonstration.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for recovering diffusion paths, clarifying why this is necessary beyond identifying seed nodes. Additionally, the authors should address the deterministic nature of their results and provide a range of possible source nodes with [S, I, R] labels. It is crucial to include a runtime analysis and complexity assessment of the proposed framework to address efficiency concerns. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the use of the denoising diffusion model and its advantages over other models, as well as provide generalization performance on larger real-world networks. Lastly, we suggest enhancing the presentation by defining all relevant notations and concepts clearly to improve understanding.
