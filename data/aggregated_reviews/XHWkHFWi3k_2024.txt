Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Self-Refining Diffusion Samplers (SRDS), inspired by the Parareal algorithm, aiming to enhance the sampling process of diffusion models by balancing sample quality and speed. The authors propose a method that reduces overall sampling latency through parallel evaluations without retraining models. Experimental results indicate that SRDS effectively accelerates convergence in image generation tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces an interesting approach by leveraging the Parareal algorithm to improve sampling speed without compromising quality.
- The theoretical analysis of sampling convergence and latency is well-articulated.
- The experiments demonstrate practical benefits, showcasing SRDS's ability to reduce sampling latency.

Weaknesses:
- The manuscript lacks a rigorous comparison with existing methods, particularly ParaDiGMS, which is crucial for validating the proposed approach.
- Limited experimental results raise concerns about the robustness of the findings, as comparisons with other fast samplers are insufficient.
- Claims regarding memory efficiency and compatibility with various solvers lack quantitative support.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion comparing SRDS with existing methods, particularly ParaDiGMS, to clarify the advantages and limitations of their approach. Additionally, we suggest providing more diverse experimental results to strengthen the empirical validation of SRDS, including comparisons with other fast samplers like Heun and DPM-Solver. Furthermore, addressing the concerns regarding the claims of memory efficiency and compatibility with off-the-shelf solvers through quantitative evidence would enhance the paper's credibility.
