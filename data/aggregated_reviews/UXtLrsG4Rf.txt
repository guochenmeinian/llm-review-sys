### Key Points
This paper presents a method for learning low-dimensional continuous-time representations of network nodes based on interaction events, represented as $(i,j,t)$, where $(i,j)$ denotes the interacting nodes and $t$ is the event time. The authors propose estimating the intensity function $\lambda_{i,j}(t)$ for each node pair at every time instant $t$, followed by projecting these intensities onto a learned lower-dimensional subspace. Theoretical results on recovery error are provided, and numerical experiments with real data demonstrate the method's effectiveness. The framework, termed Intensity Profile Projection (IPP), aims to capture temporal dynamics and relationships in dynamic networks with high statistical precision and interpretability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces the innovative IPP framework, effectively utilizing intensity profiles to capture temporal dynamics.
- Theoretical analysis demonstrates high statistical precision and interpretability through "temporal coherence."
- The method is generally easy to follow and well-organized, with strong empirical performance on simulated data and real-world applications.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation is vague, particularly in the introduction, which lacks specificity regarding the problem setting and the importance of dynamic models.
- The related work section is insufficiently detailed, lacking summaries of the contributions of cited papers and comparisons to the proposed work.
- The method's novelty is questioned, as SVD decomposition is a common technique that may not adequately address long-tailed singular values or negative reconstruction values.
- Limited comparison with state-of-the-art methods, particularly GraphODEs, raises concerns about the robustness of performance claims.
- Scalability and computational requirements of the IPP framework are not thoroughly discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by providing a more specific context for the problem setting, emphasizing the significance of dynamic models and continuous-time event data. Additionally, the related work section should be expanded to include concise summaries of the contributions of referenced papers and clarify how their work differs. The authors should address the correctness of Lemma 1 and clarify notation differences in Section 3. We suggest including a comprehensive comparison with existing continuous models, particularly GraphODEs, to substantiate performance claims. Furthermore, a discussion on the scalability of the IPP framework and its computational requirements would enhance the paper's rigor. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide more empirical results and qualitative analyses beyond simulated data to strengthen their claims.
