Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Alternative Modality Masking Pruning (AlterMOMA), a pruning framework that utilizes alternative masking on each modality to identify redundant parameters in camera-LiDAR fusion models. The authors propose a method to detect redundant features through a reactivation process, followed by pruning based on an importance score evaluation function. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and KITTI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AlterMOMA, showing superior performance compared to existing pruning methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written, introducing an innovative approach to pruning by alternately applying masking to identify and eliminate fusion-redundant parameters.
2. Thorough analysis and formula derivation for the Deactivated Contribution Indicator (DeCI) and Reactivated Redundancy Indicator (ReRI) modules enhance the methodology.
3. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of AlterMOMA across multiple tasks.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper does not illustrate the costs associated with the proposed pruning method.
2. Generalizability to other fusion tasks and modalities beyond camera-LiDAR is not verified.
3. The running speed after pruning is not reported, and there is a lack of analysis regarding performance improvements post-pruning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the computational overhead introduced by the pruning process, particularly concerning training time and resources required for reactivation and evaluation. Additionally, we suggest including an analysis of the performance after pruning, especially addressing the observation that it is better than the original version. Furthermore, exploring the applicability of AlterMOMA to other multimodal tasks, such as action recognition, would enhance the paper's contribution. Lastly, ensure that the additional experimental results are included in the supplementary material and maintain consistent font sizes in tables for better readability.
