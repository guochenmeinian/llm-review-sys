Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents WiOR-(C)BO, a novel algorithm for without-replacement sampling in (conditional) bilevel optimization. The authors demonstrate improved convergence rates under standard assumptions, enhancing existing complexity results. The paper also validates the algorithm's effectiveness through empirical applications in hyper-data cleaning and hyper-representation learning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The assumptions are standard, and the convergence rates surpass those of existing results.
2. The empirical performance is superior to compared algorithms.
3. The paper introduces a novel application of without-replacement sampling, showcasing rigorous theoretical analysis and clear communication of complex concepts.

Weaknesses:
1. The claimed improvement from $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\max\{m,n\}^p\epsilon^{-3})$ is not as significant as stated. Clarification on the influence of $p$ and the potential for achieving $\mathcal{O}(\max\{m,n\}\epsilon^{-2})$ with true gradients is needed.
2. The rationale for using without-replacement sampling over with-replacement sampling is weak, particularly since SOBA with-replacement can achieve $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$.
3. The novelty in algorithmic design appears limited, resembling a combination of SOBA and existing without-replacement strategies.
4. The paper lacks sensitivity analysis regarding hyperparameter choices, raising concerns about robustness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the improvement claims regarding convergence rates, particularly the role of $p$ in the complexity bounds. Additionally, the authors should provide a more robust justification for the choice of without-replacement sampling, especially in light of the performance of with-replacement methods. We suggest including a sensitivity analysis of hyperparameters to assess the algorithm's robustness under varying conditions. Lastly, enhancing the presentation of empirical results and addressing the clarity of figures would improve the overall quality of the paper.
