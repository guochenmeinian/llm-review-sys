Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents LAMBDABEAM, a neural search method for program synthesis that extends CROSSBEAM to handle lambda functions and higher-order functions. The authors introduce the MERGE operator to ensure that constructed lambda terms have no free variables and utilize a novel generalization of property signatures for representing lambda expressions. The results indicate that LAMBDABEAM outperforms existing techniques in the integer list manipulation domain, as demonstrated on a modified DeepCoder benchmark.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a significant problem in synthesizing lambdas and higher-order functions, potentially enabling arbitrary looping computations.
2. Experimental results are promising, showcasing the method's effectiveness.
3. The writing is generally clear and well-structured.
4. The approach contributes meaningfully to the current landscape dominated by LLMs, suggesting a complementary relationship.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a figure illustrating the LAMBDABEAM model architecture, which would clarify its distinctions from CROSSBEAM.
2. Experimental settings are confusing, particularly regarding the differing number of I/O examples for list and integer outputs.
3. The reliance on hand-designed features and testing on a single synthetic dataset raises concerns about scalability and generalizability.
4. The paper does not adequately justify why prior works cannot model lambda functions or higher-order functions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by including a figure that illustrates the LAMBDABEAM model architecture. Additionally, further explanation of the experimental settings, particularly regarding the choice of I/O examples, would enhance understanding. It would be beneficial to fine-tune the LLM on the proposed DSL for a more robust comparison. We suggest including more examples in the appendix, as well as addressing the limitations and potential societal impacts of the approach. Lastly, clarifying the justification for the inability of prior works to synthesize lambda functions would strengthen the paper's argument.
