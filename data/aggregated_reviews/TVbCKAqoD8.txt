Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of two estimators for the diagonal elements of the Fisher information matrix (FIM) in parametric neural network models. The authors derive practical bounds for the variances of these estimators and identify scenarios in which each estimator is preferable. The results are applicable to both regression and classification problems, and the authors provide a modest empirical evaluation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The analysis of Fisher information estimators is timely and relevant, particularly for natural gradient descent applications.  
- The paper is extensive, mathematically sound, and well-structured, with clear notation and thorough explanations.  
- The identification of specific scenarios for estimator preference offers practical guidance for researchers and practitioners.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper is highly technical, and the numerical examples are somewhat simplistic.  
- There is significant overlap with previous work by Soen and Sun (2021), raising questions about the novelty and contribution of the current submission.  
- The results assume that the parameter $\theta$ is equal to its true value, neglecting the variability introduced by using the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE).  
- The significance of estimating the FIM in practical applications, such as neural network optimization, is not clearly articulated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how their submission advances the field compared to Soen and Sun (2021), particularly in terms of the bounds derived. It would be beneficial to explicitly state the scenarios in which each estimator is preferred and provide guidelines for practitioners. Additionally, we suggest including a numerical example for regression similar to Fig. 2 to enhance practical relevance. The authors should also address the implications of using MLE and discuss the impact of model misspecification on their findings. Finally, simplifying the exposition and reducing the equation-driven nature of the writing could improve overall readability.
