Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a subclass of Markov Games (MG) characterized by local interactions and a zero-sum structure for their Q value functions, generalizing zero-sum polymatrix games. The authors demonstrate that the marginal distribution of a Markov Coarse Correlated Equilibrium (CCE) corresponds to a Markov Nash Equilibrium (NE) and establish that computing a stationary Markov CCE/NE is PPAD-hard. They introduce a fictitious play algorithm that converges to a stationary Markov CCE for star graph structures and another algorithm based on optimistic multiplicative weight updates that converges to a non-stationary Markov CCE. Additionally, the paper emphasizes the computational tractability and relevance of stationary equilibria in multi-agent Markov games, arguing that they are easier to describe, require less memory, and are simpler to implement compared to non-stationary equilibria. The authors highlight the fundamental differences in computational complexity between stationary and non-stationary equilibria, asserting that their focus on stationary equilibria is justified by classical literature and is crucial for understanding multi-agent decision-making.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a challenging class of games with limited existing results, making notable progress in this area.  
- The analysis is rigorous, and the technical aspects are well-discussed.  
- The originality of the proposed class of Markov games and the convergence properties of learning dynamics are significant contributions.  
- The authors provide a clear rationale for studying stationary equilibria, citing their ease of description, memory efficiency, and implementation simplicity.  
- The discussion of real-world applications demonstrates the practical relevance of the research.

Weaknesses:  
- The motivation for this class of games is unclear and lacks depth, making the results appear vague.  
- The motivation for the study is perceived as misaligned with the paper's content, leading to confusion regarding the significance of stationary equilibria.  
- Some reviewers argue that the technical contributions are incremental and lack originality compared to existing literature.  
- The presentation is notationally heavy, with some statements being messy and difficult to digest.  
- The writing quality is noted as an area needing improvement, particularly in clarity and detail.  
- The results for stationary equilibrium are disappointing, lacking clear motivation for their computation.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind the proposed class of games and the significance of computing stationary equilibria. It would be beneficial to provide a more intuitive explanation of the definitions and propositions, as well as to simplify the notation where possible. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the connection between their results and existing literature, particularly regarding the novelty of their techniques. Enhancing the alignment between the motivation and the content of the paper would help clarify the significance of stationary equilibria. Addressing concerns regarding the originality of the technical contributions by highlighting unique aspects of their analysis compared to existing works would strengthen the paper. We also recommend enhancing the clarity and organization of the writing, particularly around technical details, to improve overall readability. Finally, providing a more robust justification for the relevance of stationary equilibria in practical applications would address reviewer concerns and strengthen the paper's impact.
