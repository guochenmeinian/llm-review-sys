Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies a Bayesian persuasion problem where the sender and receiver act sequentially. The authors propose a new problem setting characterized by two main changes: (1) the sender ceases recommendations if the receiver does not comply, and (2) the inclusion of farsighted receivers, contrasting with previous works that focused on myopic receivers. The authors demonstrate that optimal Markovian signaling schemes are not effective, introducing a new class of promise-form signaling schemes that can be computed in polynomial time while ensuring the \(\epsilon\)-persuasive property. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper clearly lists key theoretical findings under the assumption that the sender will stop providing recommendations.
2. A novel class of promise-form signaling schemes is presented, along with practical approximation algorithms that can be executed in polynomial time.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper is difficult to read due to inadequate descriptions and a lack of concrete examples, making it hard for a general audience to grasp the significance of sequential moves in Bayesian persuasion.
2. There is insufficient justification for the critical assumption that the sender will stop providing recommendations, necessitating further emphasis on the rationality of this choice.
3. The paper lacks a discussion on potential limitations and does not adequately connect its findings to existing literature on dynamic Stackelberg equilibrium or repeated games.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing more concrete examples and explicitly discussing the importance of the sequential move in Bayesian persuasion. Additionally, further justifications are needed for the assumption that the sender will stop recommending actions, including potential real-world applications that validate this assumption. We also encourage the authors to include a discussion on the limitations of their model and to connect their work with existing literature on dynamic games and the implications of \(\epsilon\)-persuasiveness. Finally, addressing the absence of numerical experiments and exploring the relationship between their methods and those in related works would enhance the paper's depth.
