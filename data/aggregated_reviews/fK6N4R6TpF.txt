### Key Points
This paper presents the creation and annotation of a Bengali dataset for biomedical texts sourced from an online consumer health platform, addressing the scarcity of resources for non-English language texts in the biomedical field. The authors propose the 'Bangla-HealthNER' dataset, which includes 31,783 samples and covers seven entity types, evaluated using transformer-based BERT models and ChatGPT. The dataset aims to enhance named entity recognition (NER) for Bengali, incorporating informal language and regional dialects.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work provides a valuable resource for medical NER in Bengali, filling a gap in low-resource languages.
- The dataset is comprehensive, representing various linguistic styles and dialects.
- The authors demonstrate a commitment to transparency by planning to share the dataset and annotation guidelines with the community.

Weaknesses:
- Essential details about the dataset, such as the number of distinct entities per type and the evaluation protocol, are missing, complicating assessment and reproducibility.
- The annotation process lacks clarity, particularly regarding entity definitions and the tools used.
- The significance of performance differences among models is not adequately addressed, and the manuscript lacks information on data use agreements and ethical considerations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the description of the dataset by including essential properties such as the number of distinct entities per type and metrics concerning entity lengths in Table 1. Additionally, the authors should provide more detailed information about the annotation process, including the definitions of entities and the tools used, referencing Neves and Seva 2019 for guidance. To enhance reproducibility, the authors should clarify how benchmark results were computed and ensure that all necessary measures for anonymization are confirmed. Finally, we suggest including more comparative results with additional models and addressing the significance of performance differences in the discussion.
