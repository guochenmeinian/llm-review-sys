### Key Points
This paper presents a solution for controller failure in Software-Defined Wide Area Networks (SD-WANs) by proposing the ARES algorithm, which collaboratively addresses flow-controller reassignment and flow rerouting. The authors formulate the problem using a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model and demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness through extensive simulations, showing a 43% improvement in average load balancing performance compared to existing solutions. However, the evaluation is primarily based on the GEANT topology, raising concerns about the generalizability of the results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents a novel approach to a known problem in SDNs.
- The optimization problem is clearly specified, and the methodology balances theoretical rigor with practical applicability.
- Extensive comparative analysis with existing algorithms provides a robust context for evaluating ARES.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for the study lacks clarity and convincing empirical evidence, particularly regarding the limitations of existing coarse-grained reassignment patterns.
- The evaluation is limited to one or two controller failures, raising questions about ARES's performance under more significant failure scenarios.
- There is insufficient analysis of the algorithm's scalability and time complexity, which are crucial for assessing its practical applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation section by providing more convincing evidence and data-driven empirical results to support their claims about existing solutions. Additionally, the authors should refine Algorithm 1 by analyzing its lower/upper bounds and time complexity to evaluate its effectiveness. Expanding the evaluation to include scenarios with more extensive controller failures would provide insights into ARES's robustness. Finally, we suggest incorporating a broader range of network topologies in the experiments to enhance the generalizability of the results.
