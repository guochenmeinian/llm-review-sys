### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of how presentation design, specifically Amazon's Buy Box mechanism, influences market outcomes within a monopolistic competition model characterized by search frictions. The authors demonstrate that without a prominent position, sellers resort to price undercutting, resulting in price instability. By assigning a prominent position to one seller, the platform can stabilize prices and enhance consumer surplus, despite increased search costs. The study emphasizes the significance of well-designed mechanisms in improving market efficiency and consumer welfare.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and technically sound, providing valuable theoretical insights into the impact of platform design on market dynamics.
- It offers a clear mathematical analysis of the model, contributing to the understanding of price stability and consumer surplus.

Weaknesses:
- The paper does not adequately discuss the limitations of the Buy Box mechanism or provide empirical verification of its findings.
- It abstracts away many complexities of the Amazon Buy Box, leading to a potential misrepresentation of its real-world applicability. The references cited are largely unrelated to the specific context of the Buy Box.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the limitations of their mechanism and consider including empirical data or simulations to validate their theoretical findings. Additionally, addressing the complexities of the Amazon Buy Box mechanism in greater detail and citing relevant literature that explores these complexities would enhance the paper's contribution. We also suggest exploring the implications of dynamic market conditions and the effects of increased search frictions on consumer participation and market efficiency. Finally, clarifying the rationale behind the assumption \( V \geq 2 \) and providing additional details in the proofs of Proposition 1 and Theorem 5 would strengthen the paper.
