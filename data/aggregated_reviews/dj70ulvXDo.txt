### Key Points
This paper presents a novel algorithm for approximating the attention matrix while ensuring differential privacy (DP). The authors focus on static computation for attention, where weights are computed once and reused, enhancing computational efficiency. They rigorously derive privacy guarantees and error bounds, addressing privacy and security issues in large language models (LLMs) when handling sensitive information.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. **Innovative**: The introduction of a new method for differential privacy in attention calculation is a significant contribution to privacy protection technologies for language models.  
2. **Practical Value**: The proposed privacy-preserving method for attention calculation is highly relevant given the widespread use of LLMs.  
3. **Theoretical and Practical Integration**: The paper effectively combines theoretical definitions with practical applications, particularly in static computation settings.  
4. **Thorough Analysis**: The theoretical analysis includes strong proofs and error analyses, contributing to the rigor of the work.  

Weaknesses:  
1. **Lack of Experimental Validation**: The absence of experimental data to demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness and comparisons with existing technologies is a significant drawback.  
2. **Insufficient Security Analysis**: There is a lack of comprehensive assessment of potential security threats, such as model inversion attacks.  
3. **Clarity of Main Results**: The benefits of the proposed method need clearer articulation, ideally with practical examples.  
4. **Complexity and Scalability Concerns**: The paper does not adequately discuss the assumptions on data and their implications for real-world scenarios, nor does it address the scalability of the approach on large datasets.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. **Add Experimental Validation**: We recommend that the authors include experimental sections demonstrating the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed algorithm through comparisons with traditional attention mechanisms and other privacy-preserving methods.  
2. **Detailed Security Assessment**: The authors should provide a thorough assessment of potential security threats, particularly measures to protect against data breaches and model attacks.  
3. **Expand Discussion and Application Scenarios**: We suggest that the authors expand the discussion on the algorithm's performance across different application scenarios, including its feasibility in real-time systems and performance on various dataset sizes.  
4. **Address Scalability and Assumptions**: The authors should discuss the assumptions made on the data and their relevance to real-world data, as well as provide complexity analysis to address scalability concerns.  
5. **Empirical Validation**: We recommend conducting empirical validation of their findings on real-world data to enhance the robustness and practicality of their theoretical results.
