Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for capturing physically plausible human motions from monocular videos by integrating a kinematic Kalman filter with physics simulation. The authors propose a fully differentiable framework that allows for supervised training, combining Kalman filtering to reduce noise from kinematic poses and physics-based simulation. The experimental results indicate competitive performance compared to existing methods. Additionally, the paper explores learnable motion modules aimed at improving motion modeling for tracking and forecasting, emphasizing the continued dominance of traditional methods like the Kalman filter in visual tracking, as evidenced by their use in multi-target tracking systems such as SORT, OC-SORT, and ByteTrack, even in 2024. The review highlights the need for further investigation into the effectiveness of newer methods against established techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method effectively utilizes Kalman filtering to enhance robustness against noise in kinematic poses.
- The framework's fully differentiable nature enables supervised training, allowing for improved learning.
- The approach is physically explainable and outperforms existing kinematics-based and physics-based methods in joint prediction accuracy.
- The writing is clear, and the experiments are well-presented.
- The paper addresses a relevant and evolving topic in tracking, particularly in the context of 3D human motion tracking from videos.
- It acknowledges the enduring effectiveness of the Kalman filter, providing a realistic perspective on current methodologies.

Weaknesses:
- The simulation and filtering process refines kinematic poses without considering image observations, potentially leading to inconsistencies with 2D poses. Visualization of 3D poses overlaid on 2D images is needed for evaluation.
- The method does not prevent penetrations between humans and the floor due to the lack of scene dynamics consideration.
- The integration of Kalman filtering with simulated velocity may result in poses that do not adhere to physical laws.
- The inertia matrix is updated online, which could compromise physical interpretability, and the contact modeling is limited to foot-ground interactions.
- There is a lack of consistent evidence demonstrating that learnable motion modules outperform the Kalman filter in practical applications.
- The paper could benefit from a more thorough examination of the Kalman filter and its newer variants to tackle emerging challenges.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the visualization of qualitative results by making the kinematic skeleton more visible and including SMPL visualizations for better clarity. Additionally, the authors should consider incorporating more physics-based metrics, such as foot skating and ground penetration, to evaluate the method's performance comprehensively. It would also be beneficial to clarify the character construction process and justify the choice of TRACE as the baseline method. Lastly, a comparison with more recent kinematic methods and a comprehensive study on different Kalman filter configurations could enhance the paper's soundness and significance. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors conduct comprehensive comparisons of learnable motion modules against the Kalman filter under various conditions and explore the Kalman filter and its newer variants to address contemporary tracking challenges effectively.
