Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the market design problem, focusing on data markets and proposing a deep learning approach to recover and discover market designs. The authors extend the RochetNet architecture for both single- and multi-buyer settings, demonstrating its effectiveness through empirical results. The approach aims to maximize revenue while ensuring truthfulness and obedience among buyers. Additionally, the paper provides results supporting both scaling-up and models involving non-matching utility, breaking results into the _ex post_ IC and Bayesian IC (BIC) settings. The authors illustrate that extensions for non-matching utilities are straightforward, involving changes to the payoff matrix. They replicate results from Bergemann et al. to show that a seller offering a single, fully-informative experiment achieves lower revenue than a menu learned by RochetNet. The discussion highlights the tradeoff between increasing prices and buyer participation, emphasizing the complexities of maximizing revenue while ensuring truthful behavior. Empirical results demonstrate the performance of their mechanisms in both the _ex post_ IC and BIC settings, noting challenges in scaling with the number of buyers in the BIC case.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel application of deep learning to data market design, showcasing its potential in economics.
- The proposed method can recover existing analytical solutions and extend to cases lacking such results.
- The analysis of Individual Rationality for mechanisms and payments is sound.
- The paper effectively demonstrates the scalability of mechanisms in the _ex post_ IC setting and provides empirical results that exceed optimal revenue in some cases.
- The authors' approach to handling non-matching utilities is clear and technically sound, with relevant illustrations.
- The discussion on the tradeoff between pricing and buyer participation is insightful and adds depth to the analysis.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for using a deep learning approach could be strengthened, particularly regarding the necessity of deep learning over simpler computational methods.
- The writing lacks clarity in certain sections, particularly in explaining essential terms and interpreting results.
- The experimental scale is limited, raising questions about the robustness of findings.
- The BIC setting presents challenges in scaling due to interim computations, limiting the reported results to only 2 and 5 buyers.
- The paper could benefit from a more thorough exploration of collusion resistance in realistic data market settings, which remains unaddressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the deep learning approach, addressing whether simpler computational methods could suffice. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the clarity of the writing by better structuring the preliminaries and providing interpretations after key equations. The authors should also consider expanding the experimental scale to strengthen the validity of their results and include comparisons with baseline methods to contextualize their findings. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the scalability of their approach in the BIC setting by exploring new techniques, such as exploiting symmetry. Lastly, we suggest extending the work to measure resistance to collusion, which would enhance the applicability of their findings in realistic market scenarios.
