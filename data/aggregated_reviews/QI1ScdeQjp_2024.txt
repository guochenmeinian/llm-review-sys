Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel element for 3D medical image segmentation, termed uC (U-shaped connection), which substitutes standard skip connections with 2D convolutions. The authors propose that this approach enhances 3D U-Net segmentation by leveraging the high in-plane resolution of medical images while maintaining computational efficiency. The method achieves state-of-the-art results across four public datasets with fewer parameters and lower computational costs, addressing challenges in 3D segmentation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- uC 3DU-Net demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on four datasets.
- The method reduces computational complexity and the number of parameters.
- The manuscript provides a comprehensive overview of challenges in 3D segmentation.

Weaknesses:
- The paper is at times difficult to read due to complex language and terminology.
- Section 3.2 lacks a clear description of the U-shaped connection.
- The principle behind the proposed DFI is inadequately explained.
- The justification for using a 2D U-Net over 3D convolutions is insufficient, potentially compromising the capture of intra-slice features.
- The main figure does not adequately represent the architecture, obscuring understanding.
- There is a lack of comparative analysis with 3D models to substantiate the choice of architecture.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the manuscript by simplifying complex language and ensuring that all technical terms are well-defined. The authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the U-shaped connection in Section 3.2 and clarify the rationale for selecting a 2D U-Net over 3D convolutions. Additionally, we suggest conducting comparative experiments with at least one 3D U-Net or 3D convolutional model to strengthen the justification for their architectural choice. Including error bars in all tables and conducting tests of statistical significance would enhance the robustness of the reported results. Lastly, addressing the discrepancies in parameter counts across tables and ensuring the availability of the code would improve transparency.
