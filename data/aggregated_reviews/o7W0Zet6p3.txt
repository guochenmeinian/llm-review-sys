Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on recovering clusters in random graphs, specifically within the stochastic block model (SBM). The authors propose an algorithm that eliminates the dependency on the number of clusters \( k \) and removes the requirement for an empty interval of cluster sizes. Additionally, the authors introduce applications of their algorithm in clustering with a faulty oracle, demonstrating improvements over existing methods in terms of cluster cardinality recovery.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem addressed is fundamental in graph clustering.
- The removal of the dependency on \( k \) and the empty interval requirement significantly enhances the algorithm's applicability.
- The authors provide experimental comparisons that favor their new algorithm over previous work.
- The write-up is clear and well-structured.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical contribution includes a substantial factor of \( 2^{13} \) in the guarantees, which may be impractical; it is hoped this constant is smaller in practice.
- The paper lacks experimental results on real-world datasets, which would provide a more realistic evaluation of the algorithm's performance.
- Some relevant literature is overlooked, and assumptions regarding the knowledge of parameters \( p \) and \( q \) are strong and may limit generalizability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the stopping criterion for their algorithm. Additionally, we suggest including experimental results on real-world datasets to validate the algorithm's performance in practical scenarios. The authors should also address the potential to reduce the \( 2^{13} \) constant in their guarantees and clarify the assumptions regarding the knowledge of \( p \) and \( q \). Lastly, a concluding section discussing future work would enhance the paper's completeness.
