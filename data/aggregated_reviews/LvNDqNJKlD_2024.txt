Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on Riemannian bilevel optimization, focusing on problems where both lower and upper-level variables are constrained on Riemannian manifolds. The authors propose several hypergradient-based algorithms utilizing Neumann series and automatic differentiation, providing convergence analysis for these methods. The paper includes experiments on synthetic problems, hyper-representation learning, meta-learning, and unsupervised domain adaptation to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The topic is significant for bilevel optimization research, and this appears to be the first work addressing this specific area.
2. The analysis is comprehensive, covering AID and ITD-based hypergradient approximations.
3. The paper is well-written, with solid theoretical results and extensive numerical experiments supporting the theory.

Weaknesses:
1. More motivating examples are needed to validate the importance of bilevel optimization on manifolds, particularly in comparisons with meta-learning methods lacking the orthogonality constraint.
2. Assumption 1 is considered too strong, requiring all iterates to be bounded in a compact space, which is not a common requirement in standard bilevel optimization.
3. The main results contain complex constants that are difficult to parse; simplifications would enhance clarity.
4. The extension in Section 3.3 would benefit from considering Hessian-vector rather than Hessian-inverse.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for bilevel optimization on manifolds by including more examples and comparisons with existing methods. Additionally, the authors should reconsider the strength of Assumption 1, possibly providing justifications or alternatives that align with common practices in bilevel optimization. Simplifying the presentation of complex constants in the main results would enhance readability. Lastly, exploring Hessian-vector approximations in Section 3.3 could provide a more interesting extension of the work.
