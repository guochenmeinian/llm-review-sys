Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents FedExProx, a federated learning method that integrates proximal splitting with extrapolation, improving upon FedProx and FedExp. The authors demonstrate that FedExProx achieves faster convergence rates and introduces adaptive methods for selecting the extrapolation parameter without prior knowledge of smoothness constants. The convergence properties are analyzed for smooth convex and strongly convex problems, showing better dependence on the smoothness coefficient \(L\) than FedExP.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces a novel method that enhances iteration complexity compared to FedProx and FedExp, particularly in the partial participation case. 
- It provides clear theoretical proofs and convergence results, including adaptive extrapolation strategies that are beneficial in practical applications.

Weaknesses:  
- The comparison to FedExP is deemed unfair as it assumes exact solutions to prox problems, while FedExp accounts for local iteration complexity. 
- The benefits of the extrapolation step are not clearly demonstrated, with only marginal differences in convergence rates noted.
- Assumptions regarding the interpolation regime and convexity are considered too strong, implying a lack of data heterogeneity, which is impractical.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the comparison between FedExProx and FedExP by addressing the local iteration complexity and the assumptions made in their analysis. Additionally, the authors should clarify the necessity of separating the extrapolation parameter from the prox factor, especially if the prox can be computed in closed form. It would also be beneficial to conduct experiments on more complex models beyond logistic regression to validate the proposed method's effectiveness. Lastly, addressing the concerns regarding Assumption 2 and its implications on data heterogeneity would strengthen the paper.
