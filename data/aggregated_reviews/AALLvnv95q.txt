Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an energy-based method for training normalizing flows with linear transformations, addressing the computational expense of evaluating the Jacobian determinant during maximum likelihood training. The authors propose a split of the log-likelihood into an energy function for data-dependent terms and a normalization constant for data-independent log-Jacobians, allowing for significant training speed-ups. The experiments demonstrate that their method achieves comparable results to traditional maximum likelihood approaches while improving training efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The approach of integrating energy-based training with normalizing flows is novel and provides a compelling rationale for reducing computational costs.  
- The experiments, including both toy and high-dimensional datasets, support the claim of improved training efficiency without substantial performance loss.  
- The paper is well-written, with appropriate references to relevant literature.

Weaknesses:  
- The relevance of the work is questionable, as linear transformations are not commonly used due to their limited expressiveness and the ease of computing Jacobian determinants in typical flow architectures.  
- The experiments lack comparisons with other advanced methods, such as continuous flows and diffusion models, which limits the demonstration of competitive advantages.  
- The presentation could be clearer, with important equations and concepts scattered throughout, making it difficult to follow.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical analysis by including comparisons with other energy-based flow models and recent architectures to better establish the advantages of their method. Additionally, clarifying the situations in which their model should be preferred over continuous flows and score-based diffusion models would enhance the paper's relevance. We also suggest restructuring the presentation for better readability, particularly by organizing key equations and discussing the score-matching loss more explicitly. Finally, addressing the limitations regarding the computational cost of inverting the flow for large dimensions would strengthen the paper.
