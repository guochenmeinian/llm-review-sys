Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents sorting algorithms enhanced by predictions in two contexts: (i) sorting with positional predictions, where each element has a predicted position, and (ii) sorting with dirty comparisons, which may include erroneous pairwise comparisons. The authors propose algorithms that leverage these predictions to achieve provably faster sorting times, demonstrating asymptotically optimal complexities. The effectiveness of the algorithms is validated through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The two settings introduced are relevant to real-world applications, showcasing practical utility.
- The algorithms are elegant and straightforward, with commendable lower-bound results.
- The paper is well-composed, particularly the introduction, which is accessible to readers unfamiliar with the topic.

Weaknesses:
- The randomized sorting algorithm with dirty comparisons operates at $O(n \log n)$, and its contribution would be stronger if it were derandomized or if the worst-case time complexity were improved to $O(\sum_i \log (\eta_i^\triangle + 2))$.
- The algorithms cannot be implemented in an "in-place manner" due to the use of extra binary trees.
- Several key works in the field are not adequately compared against, particularly those by Kristo et al. and others related to learned sorting algorithms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the algorithm with dirty comparisons by exploring derandomization techniques, such as using rotations in the binary search tree. Additionally, addressing the handling of ties in the sorting order and the stability of the algorithms would enhance clarity. A thorough comparison with existing literature, particularly the works of Kristo et al. and others, should be included to contextualize the contributions of this paper. Lastly, we suggest a careful proofreading to correct grammatical errors and improve overall presentation clarity.
