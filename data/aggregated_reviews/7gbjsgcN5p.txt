Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for unsupervised optical flow estimation using spike cameras, leveraging dynamic timing representation and an unsupervised loss function. The authors demonstrate their approach through experiments on a newly created synthetic dataset, SSES, aimed at extreme scenes in autonomous driving. The results indicate that their method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing techniques. Additionally, the authors address reviewers' comments and propose enhancements to the article by incorporating relevant discussions that were highlighted in the initial reviews, emphasizing the importance of constructive discourse within the academic community.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces an innovative approach to unsupervised optical flow estimation, utilizing spike cameras and dynamic timing representation, potentially opening new research avenues.
2. The methodology is presented clearly, with sufficient detail and relevant diagrams aiding comprehension.
3. The authors collect their own dataset, which is a valuable contribution, and the ablation study on loss terms is insightful.
4. The authors have diligently addressed the reviewers' inquiries, aligning their responses with the nature of the questions posed, demonstrating a commitment to fostering constructive dialogue and improving the paper based on feedback.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a thorough discussion of the method's limitations and does not address scenarios where performance may degrade, such as occlusions or complex scenes.
2. There is confusion regarding the differences between spike and event cameras, which could mislead readers about the relevance of the work.
3. The experimental section does not compare the proposed method against widely used datasets like MVSEC and DSEC, limiting its completeness.
4. Some reviewers believe that certain points raised in the initial review remain inadequately discussed and should be integrated into the article.
5. The paper requires extensive proofreading for grammatical errors and clarity, and some technical terms are not clearly defined.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the limitations of their method, particularly in relation to occlusions and complex scenes. Additionally, including real-world examples would enhance the practical relevance of the research. Clarifying the differences between spike and event cameras early in the paper is essential to avoid confusion. We also suggest comparing the proposed method against standard RGB frames to quantify its benefits and addressing the runtime analysis of the proposed method. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to add discussions on the points raised in the initial reviews, as these are considered important by the reviewers. Finally, we urge the authors to share their code and datasets for better reproducibility and to conduct a thorough proofreading to enhance the overall clarity and professionalism of the paper.
