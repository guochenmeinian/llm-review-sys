### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into differentially private stochastic convex optimization (DP-SCO) under heavy-tailed gradients, achieving a nearly optimal rate of $G_2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} + G_k\left(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n \varepsilon}\right)^{1-\frac{1}{k}}$. The authors propose a novel reduction-based framework that adapts strategies from the uniform Lipschitz setting, leading to optimal rates under (ε,δ)-approximate differential privacy. The work includes algorithms for known Lipschitz constants and smooth functions, alongside a population-level localization framework that provides robust bounds on excess population loss.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper introduces a novel reduction-based framework for handling heavy-tailed gradients, marking a significant advancement in DP-SCO.  
2. It provides a comprehensive analysis of prior work, enabling readers to understand the necessity of this research.  
3. The algorithms proposed yield quantitative improvements over previous methods, achieving optimal rates in the heavy-tailed setting.

Weaknesses:  
1. The presentation requires improvement; critical sections, such as Population-level Localization, are inadequately discussed and placed at the end of the paper.  
2. There are notational inconsistencies and unclear explanations throughout the paper, which hinder readability and understanding.  
3. The lack of experimental validation is concerning, as practical implications are crucial for the field.  
4. The absence of a conclusion section is unusual and suggests a lack of thorough consideration of the work's limitations and broader impacts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 3, particularly the connection between Sections 3.1 and 3.2. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed discussion on how to choose parameters like $\lambda$ in Algorithm 2 and clarify what $\Delta 4^i$ in Equation 8 represents. To enhance readability, we suggest specifying the algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ from Corollary 2 within the proof of Algorithm 3. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include experimental results to validate their proposed algorithms and to add a conclusion section that discusses the limitations and broader implications of their work. Lastly, a careful proofreading of the paper is necessary to address notational inconsistencies and improve the overall presentation.
