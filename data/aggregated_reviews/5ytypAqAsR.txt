Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to generalized category discovery (GCD) by introducing the CLEVR-4 benchmark, which allows for the classification of unlabelled samples based on a taxonomy defined by labeled sets. The dataset comprises four independent taxonomies: shape, texture, color, and count. The authors propose the method $\mu$GCD, which builds upon SimGCD by incorporating an EMA teacher and strong-weak augmentations, demonstrating improved performance on both the CLEVR-4 benchmark and existing benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed CLEVR-4 benchmark is original and addresses a significant issue in current GCD methods, highlighting the limitations of unsupervised classification algorithms.  
- The paper includes thorough evaluations, ablation studies, and analytical figures that clarify the improvements made.  
- The presentation is clear and fluent, with sufficient technical details provided for reproducibility.  

Weaknesses:  
- The methodology of $\mu$GCD appears to be an incremental extension of SimGCD, raising questions about its novelty as a major contribution.  
- The discussion of the CLEVR-4 dataset lacks comprehensiveness, particularly regarding the impact of different augmentations on category discovery.  
- The reliance on synthetic data may limit the practical applicability of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the novelty of $\mu$GCD, clarifying its contribution relative to existing methods like SimGCD. Additionally, we suggest including a more comprehensive analysis of the CLEVR-4 dataset, particularly experiments that explore the effects of various augmentations on performance. Finally, addressing the limitations of using synthetic data and providing insights into real-world applicability would strengthen the paper's impact.
