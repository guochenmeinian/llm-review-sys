Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method called Multi-scale Positional Encoding (Ms-PoE) aimed at mitigating the 'lost-in-the-middle' effect observed in large language models (LLMs). Ms-PoE employs position index rescaling with distinct scaling ratios for each attention head, enhancing the model's ability to process relevant information in the middle of the context without requiring fine-tuning. Experimental results indicate that Ms-PoE achieves an average accuracy improvement of up to 3.8% on the Zero-SCROLLS benchmark.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Ms-PoE is a plug-and-play method that is simple, efficient, and does not require additional training.
- The observation regarding "position-aware" attention heads and the dynamic application of scaling ratios is insightful.
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The performance improvement is limited compared to the "Self-Extend" method, which is a variant of "Multi-Scale Positional Encoding."
- The definition of "Long Context" is vague, and there is a lack of analysis on how context length impacts the effectiveness of Ms-PoE.
- The heuristic for scaling ratio allocation appears arbitrary, lacking strict justification for its effectiveness.
- There is insufficient evidence demonstrating that rescaled position embeddings significantly enhance attention head performance, and the analysis of hyperparameters may have been influenced by test set performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of what constitutes a "Long Context" and conduct experiments to analyze the impact of context length on Ms-PoE's effectiveness. Additionally, we suggest providing a more rigorous justification for the scaling ratio allocation process and including attention maps to substantiate claims regarding the performance of attention heads. It would also be beneficial to ensure that hyperparameter tuning is conducted on the validation set to avoid potential test set leakage.
