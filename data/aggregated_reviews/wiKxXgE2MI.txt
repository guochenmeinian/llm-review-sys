### Key Points
This paper addresses significant challenges faced by current ensemble methods in achieving robust generalization under distribution shifts. The authors propose a novel framework that incorporates selective models evaluated by error, supported by theoretical proof, and filtered by Determinantal Point Processes (DPP), considering both diversity and quality. The authors first establish a generalization error bound and provide strong theoretical derivations, demonstrating that previous weight-averaging methods for model aggregation can achieve a tighter generalization error bound by accounting for both quality and diversity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors propose a novel kernel construction based on DPP to select models that balance high performance (quality) and diversity.
- The method is plug-and-play, designed for easy application without extensive modifications to existing systems.
- It overcomes limitations of traditional i.i.d. data assumptions, offering flexibility for a wider range of scenarios.
- Experimental results appear improved, despite a small test dataset and lack of benchmarks from other merging methods for comparison.

Weaknesses:
- Limited novelty, as the method primarily applies DPP for model selection without introducing substantial new methodologies.
- Lack of effective comparison, with experiments missing comprehensive evaluations against established methods, making it difficult to assess performance relative to other techniques.
- The derivation of the generalization error bound relies on assumptions (like i.i.d.) that may not hold in all cases, potentially affecting the practical applicability of the theoretical results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their approach by exploring additional methodologies beyond the application of DPP. We also suggest incorporating comprehensive comparisons with established methods in the field to strengthen the evaluation of the proposed method's performance. Furthermore, we advise the authors to address the assumptions underlying the generalization error bound to enhance the practical applicability of their theoretical results.
