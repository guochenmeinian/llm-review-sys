### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive multilingual analysis of CorefUD 1.1, detailing coreference property differences across 12 languages. The authors propose a hybrid coreference model that integrates mBERT with morphosyntactic features, which demonstrates a 0.9% F1 improvement over the baseline model from the CRAC 2022 shared task using CorefUD 1.0. The study includes a quantitative analysis of the CorefUD corpus and an error analysis of the best-performing system in the shared task, providing insights into multilingual coreference resolution.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The multilingual analysis of CorefUD 1.1 is thorough and informative.  
- The proposed hybrid model effectively combines mBERT with morphosyntactic information, achieving state-of-the-art results.  
- The error analysis offers valuable insights into challenges faced by coreference systems.

Weaknesses:  
- The statistical significance of the results is not addressed.  
- There is a lack of error analysis for the authors' own system and insufficient explanation of key concepts like Root Cause Analysis.  
- The evaluation methodology is questionable, as it uses a non-standard test set and switches between CorefUD 1.1 and 1.0 without clear justification.  
- The paper does not adequately address confounding factors in the quantitative analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their evaluation methodology by consistently using the same dataset and evaluation metrics as the shared task. Additionally, the authors should include a detailed error analysis for their own system and clarify the role of manually annotated UD columns in their results. It would also be beneficial to address the statistical significance of their findings and provide a more thorough explanation of concepts such as Root Cause Analysis. Finally, we suggest that the authors explore confounding factors in their quantitative analysis to enhance the robustness of their claims.
