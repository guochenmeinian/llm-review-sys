Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on zero-sum polymatrix Markov games, a stochastic extension of zero-sum polymatrix normal-form games. The authors demonstrate that under the switching control assumption, the marginal policy of any approximate coarse correlated equilibrium (CCE) is an approximate Nash equilibrium (NE), facilitating efficient computation of NE through CCE. The paper also provides a counterexample illustrating that this equilibrium collapse does not hold when the transition is influenced by more than two players.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces an interesting class of Markov games, enhancing understanding of equilibrium computation.
- It is well-structured with solid proofs and clear results, making it easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The clarity of the paper can be improved; notation is sometimes confusing and heavy, such as the use of $\cdot^\dagger$ for best responses.
- The switching control assumption is quite strong, limiting the generality of the results.
- The paper lacks sufficient intuition and explanations for the theoretical results and programs, making it less self-contained.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the notation and definitions throughout the paper, particularly by addressing the confusing use of symbols and providing explicit explanations for terms like $P_{NE}$. Additionally, we suggest including a brief textual description of the variables and constraints in the linear program to enhance comprehension. It would also be beneficial to provide more intuition behind the relationship between CCEs and best response policies, as well as a discussion of the algorithm introduced by Daslakakis et al. to make the theoretical framework more accessible. Lastly, addressing the limitations of the switching control assumption with a more general condition for efficient computation would strengthen the paper.
