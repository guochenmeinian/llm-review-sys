Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of the multi-fidelity multi-armed bandit (MF-MAB) problem, where each arm can be pulled at varying fidelities, affecting the accuracy of observed rewards and associated costs. The authors propose a best-arm identification algorithm utilizing a lower-upper confidence bound (LUCB) framework and introduce a novel definition of regret that accounts for fidelity impacts. The paper provides both upper and lower bounds for cost complexity and regret in different scenarios. Additionally, the authors present a new numerical simulation comparing two exploration policies, $\texttt{Explore-A}$ and $\texttt{Explore-B}$, against a $\texttt{Baseline}$ that consistently selects the highest fidelity arms. The simulation aims to demonstrate scenarios where the low-fidelity exploration policies outperform the baseline, with results indicating that $\texttt{Explore-A}$ consistently outperforms $\texttt{Explore-B}$, particularly in high-cost scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a novel perspective on the MF-MAB problem, contributing significant theoretical results for both best-arm identification and regret minimization.
- The overall presentation is clear, making the paper easy to follow.
- The application-oriented discussions following theoretical analyses enhance the practical relevance of the findings.
- The tightness of the theoretical results is validated, as noted in Remarks 3.6, 4.4, and 4.5.
- The simulation results effectively illustrate the advantages of low-fidelity exploration, particularly in high-cost scenarios.
- The theoretical focus on algorithm development and guarantees is well-articulated.

Weaknesses:
- The assumption that estimates $\tilde{\mu}_1^{(M)}$ and $\tilde{\mu}_2^{(M)}$ can be obtained in real-world applications is unrealistic, potentially limiting the practical applicability of the proposed algorithm.
- The algorithm's reliance on upper and lower bounds for the first and second arms may lead to loose comparisons between cost complexity bounds.
- The paper lacks experimental validation of the proposed framework, which is crucial for demonstrating its effectiveness.
- The performance of $\texttt{Explore-B}$ is consistently inferior to $\texttt{Explore-A}$, raising questions about its utility.
- The discussion lacks depth regarding scenarios where $\texttt{Explore-B}$ may be advantageous, with only a reference to Figure 1(b) for further context.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the algorithm by moving it from the appendix to the main text, ensuring that key design choices are explicitly discussed. Additionally, we suggest providing more detailed explanations for technical terms and assumptions, particularly regarding the error upper bounds and the implications of the cost complexity bounds. It would also be beneficial to include experimental evaluations to substantiate the theoretical claims and to clarify the conditions under which the proposed regret bounds hold. Furthermore, we recommend enhancing the discussion surrounding $\texttt{Explore-B}$ by providing more detailed scenarios where it may outperform $\texttt{Explore-A}$. Including the new comparison in the final version of the paper, as mentioned, will enhance the clarity and completeness of the results. Lastly, further validation of the algorithms with experiments on larger datasets is encouraged to strengthen the findings.
