Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the inter- & intra-modality modeling (I2M2) framework, which addresses the limitations of traditional approaches in supervised multi-modal learning by integrating both inter-modality and intra-modality dependencies. The authors propose a generative model perspective that enhances the prediction accuracy of multi-modal data, validated through extensive experiments on real-world datasets from healthcare and vision-and-language domains, demonstrating superior performance compared to methods focusing on a single type of modality dependency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The I2M2 framework effectively captures and integrates both inter-modality and intra-modality dependencies, leading to improved predictions and model performance.
2. The framework's adaptability without requiring prior knowledge of dependency strength enhances its versatility across different scenarios.
3. Experimental evaluations confirm the I2M2 framework's superiority over traditional methods that focus on only one type of modality dependency.

Weaknesses:
1. The implementation details, particularly regarding the simulation of q_{x, x'}(y|x, x') or q_{x}(y|x) in Equations 4/5, are unclear and require a more thorough explanation.
2. The paper lacks a comprehensive comparison with the latest state-of-the-art methods in multi-modal learning, which would better position the I2M2 framework within the current research landscape.
3. There is insufficient discussion on the performance of intra-modal methods, raising questions about their relevance in processing multi-modal data.
4. The authors need to provide a detailed analysis of the limitations mentioned, including computational costs and model initialization challenges.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the implementation details, specifically how the conditional probabilities are computed in Equations 4/5. Additionally, we suggest that the authors conduct a more comprehensive comparison with recent state-of-the-art methods to better contextualize their contributions. It would also be beneficial for the authors to analyze the significance of intra-modal methods in their framework and provide a thorough discussion on the limitations, including potential workarounds for computational challenges. Lastly, we encourage the authors to include more valuable experimental results that reflect the relationships and dependencies between modalities beyond mere performance improvements.
