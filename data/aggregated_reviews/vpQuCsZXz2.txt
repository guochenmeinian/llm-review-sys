Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach called hierarchical prompting for hierarchical image classification (HIC) using a model named TransHP. The authors propose inserting coarse label tokens at intermediate layers of a Vision Transformer (ViT) to enhance feature extraction and classification accuracy. The prompting block dynamically adjusts the features based on task-specific information, leading to improved performance on datasets like ImageNet and iNaturalist. Experiments indicate that the method is more data-efficient and focuses on distinctive features.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, supported by effective visualizations.
2. Experimental results validate the proposed method and align with the authors' claims about focusing on discriminant features.
3. The innovative concept of coarse label prompting shows promise in improving classification accuracy.

Weaknesses:
1. The method's generalizability across different tasks remains unclear; specific characteristics that influence performance, such as the number of classes or prompt blocks, need exploration.
2. The application is limited to scenarios with hierarchical relationships among target tasks, raising questions about its effectiveness in non-hierarchical contexts.
3. Several technical aspects, such as the handling of imbalanced hierarchies and the selection of intermediate transformer blocks for prompt insertion, lack clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method by explicitly detailing the locations of prompting blocks and addressing how the method performs with imbalanced hierarchies. Additionally, conducting experiments on datasets without hierarchical structures could provide insights into the method's applicability. We suggest comparing the proposed method with established techniques, such as VPT and HD-CNN, to strengthen the contribution and validate the effectiveness of the prompting mechanism. Lastly, clarifying the role of absorption weights and the rationale behind the performance improvements attributed to coarse loss would enhance the paper's robustness.
