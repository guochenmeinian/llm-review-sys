Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Perturbed Frank-Wolfe Sampling (P-FWS), an algorithm for best arm identification in combinatorial semi-bandits within a fixed confidence setting. The algorithm achieves instance-specific minimal sample complexity in the high confidence regime and polynomial sample complexity guarantees in the moderate confidence regime. The authors demonstrate that P-FWS effectively closes the computational-statistical gap in best arm identification. The design of P-FWS is rooted in the optimization problem that defines the information-theoretical and instance-specific sample complexity lower bound, solved online using the Frank-Wolfe algorithm with efficient successive updates.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
P-FWS is a novel algorithm that addresses the best arm identification problem in combinatorial semi-bandits, achieving optimal sample complexity in both high and moderate confidence regimes. This significant contribution highlights the closure of the computational-statistical gap, demonstrating efficiency in computational complexity and statistical performance. The theoretical rigor is strong, with detailed proofs supporting the claims.

Weaknesses:  
The paper primarily focuses on theoretical analysis, lacking empirical experiments or evaluations on real-world datasets, which could provide insights into practical performance and generalizability. Additionally, the algorithm's complexity may deter practical application, as it is tailored to a specific setting, and the results are asymptotic. The writing quality is also a concern, with poor explanations of key components and excessive complexity in notation, making it difficult to follow.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and readability of the manuscript by simplifying the notation and providing clearer explanations for key components, such as the LM oracle and the forced exploration rules. Including empirical evaluations and comparisons with other algorithms would enhance the practical relevance of the findings. Furthermore, we suggest discussing the limitations of the algorithm's applicability to more general combinatorial problems and referencing relevant works, such as https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11182, to contextualize the scope of their contributions.
