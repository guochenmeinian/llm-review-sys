Aggregated Review:
**Key Points:**
We note that the paper explores state-of-the-art (SOTA) weakly-supervised methods for video anomaly detection (VAD) in autonomous driving, reorganizing the DoTA dataset into WS-DoTA. It introduces a Feature Transformation Block (FTB) and validates its effectiveness through extensive experiments. The visualization in Figure 2 effectively illustrates the characteristics of the dataset.

**Strengths and Weaknesses:**
Strengths include the creation of the WS-DoTA benchmark, the introduction of the FTB, and convincing experimental results demonstrating the method's effectiveness. However, weaknesses are evident in the insufficient exploration of experiments, lack of discussion on the impact of moving camera conditions versus static ones, and the absence of pre-trained video features. Additionally, writing issues are present, including citation errors and unclear explanations in tables.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
We suggest enhancing the method by incorporating pre-trained video features and discussing the geometric correspondence of frames using camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. Further elaboration on how the dataset addresses challenges specific to moving camera scenarios is needed. Additionally, we recommend addressing writing errors and clarifying the confusion in Table 2 regarding performance metrics.
