### Key Points
This paper presents the "BanglaAbuseMeme" dataset, which includes 4,043 Bengali memes annotated as abusive or non-abusive, with additional labels for sentiment, sarcasm, vulgarity, and target communities. The authors implement and compare various baseline models for automatic detection of abusive memes, demonstrating that multimodal models outperform unimodal ones. The study also includes a qualitative error analysis, providing insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the models in the context of Bengali memes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of the BanglaAbuseMeme dataset addresses a significant gap in research on abusive meme detection in low-resource languages.
- The paper provides a thorough explanation of the annotation process, enhancing transparency and understanding of the dataset.
- A comprehensive analysis of various baseline models is conducted, showcasing advancements in abusive meme detection.

Weaknesses:
- The paper does not adequately compare its methods with previous studies on abusive meme detection, particularly for Bengali data.
- Concerns arise regarding the annotation strategy, as discussing annotators' errors may introduce bias.
- Figures and tables are poorly aligned with the text, and the small font size affects readability.
- The paper lacks depth in exploring potential biases and challenges specific to the Bengali language and cultural context.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparative analysis with existing benchmarks for abusive meme detection in other languages to enhance the paper's broader impact. Additionally, addressing the annotation strategy's potential biases and providing clearer reasoning for observations in Section 5.4 would strengthen the study. The authors should also consider including multitasking approaches given the available labels for sarcasm, vulgarity, and sentiment. Lastly, improving the alignment and font size of figures and tables will enhance overall readability.
