Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a fully data-driven relighting method that operates without requiring ground-truth lighting supervision, utilizing only paired images of the same scene under different illuminations. The approach enables the model to learn intrinsic and extrinsic features, facilitating applications such as albedo estimation and scene relighting. Experimental results indicate that the method significantly outperforms unsupervised baselines and is competitive with supervised state-of-the-art methods. The authors also introduce a constrained scaling mechanism to enhance the model's performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The methodology is novel and effective, achieving significant results in relighting without supervision on intrinsic properties.  
2. The presentation is clear and the methodology is straightforward, with comprehensive explanations of inputs, outputs, and losses.  
3. The experiments are thorough, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in relighting and albedo estimation.

Weaknesses:  
1. Several novel regularizations proposed in the paper are not ablated, leaving their impact on model accuracy unclear.  
2. The method lacks fine-grained control over relighting parameters, such as intensity and direction.  
3. Generalization ability is questionable, as the model's performance drops when tested on out-of-distribution images.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including ablation studies for the novel regularizations to clarify their contributions to model accuracy. Additionally, it would be beneficial to empirically evaluate the consistency of estimated albedo across different illuminations. We suggest incorporating missing citations relevant to the image-based relighting domain to strengthen the literature review. Furthermore, addressing the generalization to out-of-distribution data by testing the model on unseen images could provide valuable insights into its robustness. Lastly, we encourage the authors to consider creating a project website to showcase results and video demonstrations of Latent Extrinsic Interpolation.
