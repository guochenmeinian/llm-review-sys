Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a cross-attention-based decoder architecture for neural operators aimed at solving PDEs using boundary meshes defined by triangular meshes. The architecture employs graph convolutions to extract features from the mesh and utilizes a transformer decoder to generate solutions in the interior domain. The model is trained on 12,000 example meshes and validated against FEM solutions, demonstrating its capability to efficiently solve PDEs with varying boundaries, which is valuable for industrial applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The introduction is clear, effectively highlighting the benefits of using PINNs in industrial contexts.  
- The architecture allows for rapid solutions of gPDEs using only neural network inference, potentially outperforming traditional FEM solvers.  

Weaknesses:  
- The architecture's hyperparameters and design details are inadequately described, lacking figures that illustrate its components.  
- The manuscript does not sufficiently address the regularization of PDE solutions with singularities in triangular geometries.  
- Presentation issues hinder understanding, particularly in defining the model's input/output and architecture rigorously.  
- Results do not convincingly support claims regarding the model's advantages over traditional methods, as comparisons with baseline methods are missing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the architecture by including figures that visually represent its components and provide detailed descriptions of hyperparameters. Additionally, addressing the regularization of PDE solutions for geometries with singularities is crucial. To strengthen the paper, we suggest including rigorous comparisons with baseline methods, such as training a neural operator for each geometry or solving PINNs from scratch, to validate the claimed advantages. Furthermore, a detailed discussion on how different discretizations affect performance should be included, especially regarding the application to non-curated meshes.
