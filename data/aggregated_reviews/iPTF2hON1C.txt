Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents L2Dive, a framework that enhances dataset-specific diving heuristics using graph neural networks. The authors employ generative models to predict variable assignments and utilize the duality of linear programs for diving decisions. Experimental results indicate improved performance in both diving and branch-and-bound tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The research topic is compelling, as the diving heuristic is effectively framed as a 0/1 prediction task, making the use of generative models practical.
2. The algorithm design is novel, particularly the insightful application of duality for variable selection.
3. The paper is well-written, facilitating reader comprehension.

Weaknesses:
1. The literature review is insufficient, as the main idea closely resembles that in [1], necessitating a comparison in the introduction.
2. Results in Table 1 are potentially misleading; the benchmarks may be too easy, raising doubts about their convincingness.
3. An ablation study is lacking, particularly in comparing dual theory-based variable selection with vanilla methods, leaving the effectiveness of the proposed strategy uncertain.
4. Comparative experiments are insufficient, especially regarding L2Dive's performance on larger instances and its generalization ability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by explicitly comparing their work with [1] to clarify the novelty of their approach. Additionally, we suggest revisiting the benchmarks used in Table 1 to ensure they are appropriately challenging for the diving task. An ablation study should be included in the main paper to compare the dual-based selection strategy with traditional methods and to analyze the trade-offs between model complexity and performance. Finally, we encourage the authors to conduct further experiments to assess L2Dive's performance on larger instances and provide timing statistics for different heuristics in Table 1.
