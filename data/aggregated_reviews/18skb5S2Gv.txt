### Key Points
This paper presents a novel perspective on kNN-MT, describing it as a specific case of model fine-tuning that implicitly executes gradient descent on the Output Projection Layer (OPL) of NMT. The authors establish connections between kNN-MT and model fine-tuning, providing theoretical insights and empirical results through multi-domain experiments. Key findings include the effectiveness of combining kNN-MT with adapter-based fine-tuning, which achieves translation quality comparable to entire-model fine-tuning, and the identification of low recall issues for in-domain low-frequency words, which can be mitigated through adapter optimization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel theoretical perspective on kNN-MT, enhancing understanding of its mechanisms.
- Detailed mathematical explanations and solid empirical analyses support the authors' claims.
- Extensive experiments and word-level analyses provide valuable insights into the performance of kNN-MT and its limitations.

Weaknesses:
- The authors do not sufficiently compare their approach with recent methods, limiting the contextual understanding of its strengths and weaknesses.
- The performance of AK-MT with adapters, while improved, is accompanied by slower inference speeds and the necessity for prior adapter fine-tuning, which are significant practical considerations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve their comparison with recent advancements in Fast kNN-MT, focusing on translation quality and generation speed. Additionally, addressing the limitations of AK-MT with adapters, particularly regarding inference speed and the need for fine-tuning, should be included to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of their method. Furthermore, clarifying the parameter settings and enhancing the logical support for certain claims would strengthen the paper's overall argumentation.
