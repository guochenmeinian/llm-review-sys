Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel algorithm, the Frequency-Inflated Conditional Diffusion Model (FiDE), aimed at improving the modeling of block maxima in time series generation, particularly for extreme events. The authors identify that traditional diffusion models inadequately address the high-frequency Fourier components associated with these extreme values. By inflating the weights of these components in the Fourier domain, FiDE retains significant extreme values typically lost in conventional methods. The paper includes a comprehensive performance comparison with various models, such as VAE, GAN, and diffusion models, across multiple datasets, evaluating four metrics to justify their choices.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem statement and proposed solution are clearly articulated and mathematically robust, addressing a critical gap in time series modeling.
- The identification of high-frequency Fourier components as pivotal to extreme value representation is a significant contribution.
- The experimental setup is well-structured, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method across diverse datasets.

Weaknesses:
- Results presented in Figure 5 are limited to one dataset, necessitating more extensive comparisons to validate the generalizability of the proposed algorithm.
- The paper indicates a degradation in modeling the bulk of the data alongside improvements in block maxima, yet lacks a quantitative assessment of this trade-off.
- The absence of ablation studies and a broader range of comparative algorithms limits the depth of the analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset diversity in their results to enhance the generalizability of their findings. A quantitative comparison of the model's performance on all maxima, alongside block maxima, is essential to fully understand the implications of using FiDE. Additionally, conducting ablation studies to explore the effects of the high-frequency inflation strategy would provide valuable insights. Clarifying the time window criteria for defining block maxima and discussing error estimation methods for reported metrics would also strengthen the paper. Finally, addressing the performance of FiDE on small-scale datasets could further validate its applicability in various contexts.
