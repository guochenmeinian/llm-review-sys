### Key Points
This paper presents a new method to mitigate hallucinations in data-to-text generation by incorporating a text critic classifier that guides the generation process. The authors propose that this approach does not require modifications to the existing language model architecture and can be integrated with minimal effort. The results indicate that while the critic approach may not significantly enhance the quality of generated text, it effectively reduces hallucinations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- The idea of using a critic to guide generation is novel and well-motivated.
- The method minimizes additional effort compared to previous approaches, potentially increasing real-world applicability.
- Extensive analysis of different training methods for the critic is provided, including human evaluation.

Weaknesses:
- The lack of baseline comparisons makes it difficult to assess the significance of the contributions, as improvements appear marginal.
- The evaluation is limited to a single dataset, which raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings.
- The analysis could benefit from finer-grained studies beyond corpus-level metrics.
- The paper lacks a conclusion section, affecting its self-containment.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve their evaluation by including comparisons with other hallucination mitigation baselines to establish the significance of their contributions. Additionally, testing on multiple datasets would enhance the generalizability of their conclusions. We suggest conducting finer-grained analyses to understand how the method impacts output quality based on the original text's quality. Finally, we advise the authors to include a conclusion section to improve the paper's overall structure and self-containment.
