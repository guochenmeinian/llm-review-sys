### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach called Auto Search Indexer (ASI), an end-to-end generative retrieval framework that integrates document-id assignment and retrieval within a joint architecture. The authors propose a seq2seq model that utilizes two semantic-oriented losses for training the indexing module and demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing baselines on multiple datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The end-to-end pipeline effectively addresses the challenges of assigning document IDs and retrieving new documents.
- The proposed semantic-oriented losses are technically sound and contribute positively to performance.
- Extensive experiments validate the model's effectiveness, showing substantial improvements over various baseline models.

Weaknesses:
- The performance evaluation may be biased due to the model's ability to match one doc ID to multiple documents, raising concerns about the fairness of recall/MRR metrics.
- Key technical details regarding the ranking of documents sharing the same doc ID are missing.
- The generative retrieval baseline used in the ADS dataset is weak, and stronger baselines should be reported for comparison.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how documents sharing the same doc ID are ranked and whether they are considered equally relevant to the query. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with stronger generative retrieval baselines, such as Ultron-Atomic, to enhance the robustness of the results. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide more detailed parameter settings and ensure that training/evaluation data are more widely accessible to facilitate reproducibility.
