### Key Points
This paper presents a method for classifying malicious servers through machine learning techniques applied to TLS handshakes. The authors utilize active probing to extract features from server responses, aiming to distinguish between benign and malicious servers, as well as identify specific botnet families. The evaluation is based on a large dataset, including Tranco's top 10K domains and blocklisted sites, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The use of a large, reproducible dataset enhances the robustness of the evaluation.
- The research addresses a significant issue in server classification, providing a potential method for detecting malicious servers.
- The methodology is sound, with a clear description of ground truth labeling.

Weaknesses:
- Limited novelty, primarily relying on existing techniques without sufficient differentiation.
- Lack of comparison with related works, such as ATSF, JARM, and DissecTLS, which is crucial for evaluating the proposed methods.
- Some sections lack clarity, particularly regarding feature selection and the rationale behind certain parameter choices.
- The methodology for handling blocklists and the validation of fingerprints is inadequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the feature selection process, particularly in Section 6.2, by providing detailed descriptions of the combinations used. Additionally, include comparisons with existing works to contextualize the results better. We suggest enhancing the explanation of the rationale behind parameter choices in Table 8 and the features in Table 3. It would be beneficial to validate the uniqueness and reproducibility of the fingerprints and clarify the handling of blocklists, particularly regarding potential false positives. Finally, we advise focusing on feature ranking to identify key differentiators between benign and malicious servers, as well as between malware families.
