### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to algorithmic recourse (AR) that addresses the challenges of providing actionable recommendations without relying on prior causal graphs or structural causal models (SCMs). The authors propose two methods, AR-L2 and AR-Nuc, which reformulate AR as structure-preserving interventions and utilize non-linear Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to ensure the feasibility of generated counterfactuals. The methods demonstrate improved performance over selected baselines, even with limited prior causal knowledge.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The methods do not require existing causal graphs or models, facilitating real-world application.
2. Structure-preserving interventions maintain causal relationships, leading to realistic recommendations.
3. The proposed methods were validated on diverse datasets, showing enhanced feasibility and accuracy.

Weaknesses:
1. The optimization process and interaction of multiple loss components are inadequately analyzed, potentially leading to training instabilities.
2. The reliance on the assumption of conditional exponentiality for exogenous noise complicates validation in real-world datasets.
3. The method's feasibility evaluation still depends on predefined constraints, raising questions about the distinction between these constraints and broader structural knowledge.
4. Limited detail is provided regarding model implementation and specific improvements compared to prior work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the optimization process, particularly the interplay of loss components, to address potential training instabilities. Additionally, clarification is needed on how the assumption of conditional exponentiality for exogenous noise can be tested within the dataset. We suggest that the authors elaborate on the differences between predefined constraints and prior structural knowledge, and consider whether using such constraints impacts the claimed contribution of their method. Furthermore, enhancing the discussion of evaluation metrics and providing source code and data for reproducibility would strengthen the paper. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore efficient approximations or distributed computing solutions to address computational complexity, especially for high-dimensional data.
