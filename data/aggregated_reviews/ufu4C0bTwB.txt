### Key Points
This paper presents the TOPDIAL dataset aimed at enhancing user experience in target-oriented proactive dialogue systems through personalization. The authors formulate the problem using a <dialogue act, topic> pair as the target and propose a role-playing framework for dataset curation, resulting in approximately 18,000 multi-turn dialogues.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a crucial area of personalized target-oriented dialogue systems, contributing to improved user experience.
- The automatic dataset curation framework is a novel and efficient method for constructing a large-scale dataset.
- The data construction method is simple yet effective, providing valuable resources for the dialogue community.

Weaknesses:
- The paper does not clearly differentiate the TOPDIAL dataset from existing datasets like DuRecDial 2.0, particularly regarding the added value of personality information.
- The significance of personalization and its impact on user experience is insufficiently discussed.
- Limitations or challenges encountered during the dataset curation process are not explicitly mentioned.
- Concerns arise regarding the reliance on large language models, questioning their sufficiency in solving personalized target-oriented dialogue issues.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the TOPDIAL dataset's distinctiveness compared to existing datasets like DuRecDial 2.0. Additionally, the authors should discuss the significance of the personalized aspect and its impact on user experience more thoroughly. Furthermore, we suggest including examples of rejecting situations, as mentioned in Line 202, to enhance understanding of user interactions with the system.
