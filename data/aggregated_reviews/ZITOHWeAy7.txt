Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical framework for contrastive learning of representations in an open-world setting, utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data of potentially new classes. The authors describe a graph encoding positive sample connections and formulate a contrastive loss based on spectral decomposition of the adjacency matrix. They prove two theorems regarding the clustering quality of representations via k-means when incorporating labels, demonstrating that labeled data can enhance clustering for poorly clustered classes with strong connections to labeled classes. The method outperforms several competitors in open-world and self-supervised representation learning. Additionally, the authors utilize an augmentation graph and a toy example to improve clustering by focusing on shapes rather than colors. They clarify their choice of parameters, specifically $\tau_c > \tau_s$, to mislead clustering initially, allowing for subsequent improvement, and address discrepancies in the value of $\mathfrak{l}_{sphere}$, attributing it to a scaling factor.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The theoretical nature of the paper is commendable, addressing the behavior of machine learning models with limited learning signals.
- The framework allows for both formal investigation and practical application, with well-written content and appropriate technical details in the appendix.
- The connection to the common contrastive SimCLR loss is discussed, and the theoretical insights appear novel for open-world representation learning.
- The authors effectively clarify complex concepts, enhancing understanding of their methodology.
- They demonstrate responsiveness to reviewer feedback, leading to improved clarity and alignment with reviewer expectations.

Weaknesses:
- The assumption that the probability $\tau_c$ of augmenting across classes is greater than $\tau_s$ for within-class augmentations is counterintuitive and may not hold in real-world scenarios.
- The empirical validation lacks experiments demonstrating the behavior of the predicted quantities in Theorems 4.1 and 4.2, which would clarify the assumptions' relevance in practical settings.
- The experiments do not sufficiently cover other benchmark datasets, and the relationship between theoretical results and empirical performance remains unclear.
- There is a need for empirical validation of the theory beyond the proposed method's evaluation.
- Some reviewers express a desire for more in-depth discussions related to the theory's implications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the assumptions regarding augmentation probabilities, particularly the rationale behind $\tau_c > \tau_s$. Additionally, including empirical experiments that illustrate the behavior of the predicted quantities in Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 would strengthen the paper. It would also be beneficial to explore performance on larger benchmark datasets, such as ImageNet-100, and to clarify the impact of different known-to-novel class ratios. Furthermore, we suggest enhancing the empirical validation of their theory by incorporating relevant discussions in the paper, as well as providing more detailed explanations regarding the discrepancies in SimCLR's performance to enhance clarity for the audience. Finally, a more detailed discussion of how the theoretical framework holds up in real-world data would enhance the paper's applicability.
