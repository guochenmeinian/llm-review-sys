### Key Points
This paper presents a detailed study of the effectiveness of SPSA-like optimizers on various parameterized quantum learning tasks using randomized quantum circuits and objectives. The authors provide thorough experimentation and findings, although the novelty appears limited, resembling more of a survey paper. The connection to Machine Learning is perceived as somewhat loose, raising questions about the paper's alignment with workshop criteria.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- Thorough experimentation and findings.  
- Interesting content from a physics and quantum computing perspective.  

Weaknesses:  
- Limited novelty, resembling a survey rather than original research.  
- Loose connection to Machine Learning, potentially questioning its relevance to the workshop.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors elaborate on the choice of randomized Hamiltonians, specifically addressing whether these Hamiltonians are natural and if they model any physical systems effectively. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the novelty of the paper to strengthen its contribution beyond a survey format.
