Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a preconditioned hidden gradient descent algorithm aimed at achieving convergence in multi-agent settings characterized as hidden monotone games. The authors propose the 'Preconditioned Hidden Gradient Dynamics' to address the challenges of non-monotone games, demonstrating convergence to Nash equilibrium through theoretical analysis and empirical experiments. The work extends existing literature by exploring hidden structures in latent space, providing a novel perspective on algorithmic game theory.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is novel and effectively addresses the problem of hidden monotone games.
- The theoretical analyses and empirical experiments validate the proposed algorithm's effectiveness.
- The paper is well-presented, with clear explanations and visual aids that enhance understanding.

Weaknesses:
- The absence of experiments on real-world datasets and adversarial scenarios limits the practical applicability of the findings.
- The presentation suffers from numerous typos and unclear notations, making it difficult to assess the correctness of the content.
- The examples provided are overly simplistic and do not sufficiently illustrate the significance of the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation quality by correcting typos and clarifying notations to enhance readability. Additionally, including experiments on real-world datasets, such as MNIST or multi-agent reinforcement learning environments, would strengthen the empirical validation of the proposed method. We also suggest expanding the range of examples to better illustrate the applicability of the algorithm in various contexts, particularly beyond the matching Pennies zero-sum game. Furthermore, a more detailed discussion on the technical challenges associated with discrete analysis compared to continuous dynamics would be beneficial.
