### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Stepwise Weighted Spike (SWS) coding scheme aimed at enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) while reducing energy consumption. The SWS coding scheme improves information encoding by stepwise weighting input signals and introducing negative pulses, which decreases the number of coding spikes required. The Ternary Self-Amplifying (TSA) neuron model further enhances accuracy by adjusting residual membrane potentials and incorporating silent periods, allowing for more input information before firing. Experimental results on datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet demonstrate that the SWS coding scheme achieves superior performance with fewer coding and computing steps, comparable to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) of similar structure.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Originality: The introduction of the SWS coding scheme and TSA neuron model is innovative, compressing spikes and enhancing performance while reducing energy consumption.
- Quality: Comprehensive experiments validate the proposed SWS coding scheme, showing significant reductions in operations and latency compared to existing methods.
- Clarity: The paper effectively motivates the work and clearly presents the methodology, with well-explained symbols contributing to overall clarity.

Weaknesses:
- Clarity and Detail: Some sections lack detailed explanations, particularly regarding the SWS coding scheme and TSA neuron model, which could hinder understanding.
- Comparative Analysis: The experimental results do not adequately demonstrate the advantages of the proposed encoding method over existing methods, particularly in the ImageNet experiments where different baselines were used.
- Grammatical Issues: The paper contains grammatical errors and inconsistencies in symbol representation, which detract from its professionalism.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by providing more detailed explanations of the SWS coding scheme and TSA neuron model. Additionally, ensure that all experimental comparisons are made using the same network architecture and pre-trained weights to enhance credibility. Address the grammatical errors and inconsistencies in symbol representation throughout the paper. Furthermore, we suggest including a dedicated "Limitations" section to discuss constraints and potential societal impacts of the proposed SWS coding scheme, as well as conducting a more thorough comparative analysis with recent works in the field, particularly those utilizing Time-to-First-Spike (TTFS) encoding.
