Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the Grouped Kernel Pruning (GKP) algorithms, addressing inefficiencies in dynamic operations and their impact on deployment speed and accuracy. The authors break down the GKP algorithm into manageable components, demonstrating that their method achieves wall-clock efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. They provide ablation studies to support their algorithmic choices and show competitive results against existing methods, particularly in data-agnostic settings without iterative pruning. The paper aims to establish a new benchmark in the accuracy-efficiency frontier for pruning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is straightforward and well-written, effectively explaining relevant concepts.
- It tackles a significant problem with strong empirical validation and relevant ablation studies.
- The proposed method shows competitive performance and efficiency improvements.

Weaknesses:
- Tables lack clarity, particularly regarding the specification of MACs and the term "BA," which needs expansion for better understanding.
- Some results are not directly comparable due to differing accuracy degradations for varying reductions in MACs and Params.
- Details on re-training processes are insufficient for reproducibility.
- Certain sections are unclear, while well-known methods like k-means are described in excessive detail.
- The paper's structure is unusual, resembling a tutorial rather than a research paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their tables, ensuring that terms like MACs and "BA" are clearly defined. It would be beneficial to compare methods with similar reductions in MACs and Params to provide a fairer assessment of their method's advantages. Additionally, please expand on the re-training details to enhance reproducibility. We suggest revising sections that are unclear and reducing unnecessary detail on well-known methods like k-means. Finally, consider restructuring the paper to align more closely with conventional research formats.
