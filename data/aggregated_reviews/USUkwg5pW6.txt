### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative algorithm for automatically generating scribble annotations for semantic segmentation datasets, addressing the scarcity of such datasets and laying a foundation for weakly supervised segmentation research. The authors propose the second scribble dataset to date and demonstrate that models trained on synthetic annotations exhibit competitive performance compared to those trained on pixel-level annotations. The experiments are well-structured and provide clear statistical analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed algorithm significantly reduces the workload of manual annotation by automatically generating scribble labels.  
- The experiments effectively demonstrate the similarity of generated scribbles to human annotations, providing a strong benchmark for evaluating scribble supervised semantic segmentation.  
- The paper is clearly structured, and the figures and tables are concise, supporting the conclusions effectively.  

Weaknesses:  
- The algorithm's reliance on existing pixel-level annotations limits its broader applicability and diminishes the cost advantage of scribble annotations.  
- The paper contains some grammatical errors and redundant phrases that detract from clarity.  
- The technical contribution is somewhat limited as the algorithm functions primarily as a dataset converter rather than generating scribbles from scratch or other weak annotations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the language by eliminating redundant phrases and correcting grammatical errors, such as changing "made" to "has made" and "show" to "shown." Additionally, we suggest evaluating the computational complexity of the algorithm to identify potential optimizations. The authors should also consider applying the scribble label generation method to entirely unlabeled datasets to enhance its applicability. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to clarify the advantages of the proposed method over existing weak supervision techniques and explore the possibility of generating multiple scribble labels in one segment.
