Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for analyzing the dynamics of distribution shifts, capturing the feedback loop between learning algorithms and the distributions they operate on through a coupled differential equations model. The authors propose that a learner updated with gradient descent converges to a steady state in both finite and infinite dimensions. The study includes scenarios of cooperation and competition, deriving PDEs that describe distributional changes and demonstrating convergence under certain regularization conditions. Numerical simulations illustrate the problem, although they are somewhat limited.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed model elegantly describes distribution shifts and the interaction between population and objective functions, offering a richer class of perturbations than typically seen in the literature.  
- The paper is well-written, technically solid, and effectively motivates the problem of interest.  
- The framework allows for complex interactions and shifts, theoretically explaining phenomena like polarization that prior models do not address.  

Weaknesses:  
- The numerical evaluation is limited, and more concrete applications of the theory would enhance the work.  
- The analysis relies on strong assumptions, which may not be entirely general, and some assumptions are less common without sufficient justification.  
- The experimental section lacks a clear connection to theoretical results and could benefit from more relevant examples beyond simple 1-dimensional settings.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the numerical evaluation by including more complex simulations that reflect real-world applications. Additionally, we suggest providing clearer motivation and justification for the strong assumptions made in the analysis, along with examples where these assumptions hold. The authors should also enhance the experimental section by explaining the objectives of the experiments and their connections to the theoretical framework, as well as comparing their results to existing prior work. Finally, exploring the potential for generalizing the analysis to discrete time settings could broaden the applicability of the findings.
