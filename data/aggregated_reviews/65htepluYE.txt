Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CATOD, a framework aimed at enhancing the adaptation of text-to-image models for out-of-distribution (OOD) concepts. It tackles the challenge of low-quality training data by employing an active learning approach to iteratively improve the training set. The framework features a dual scoring system that includes aesthetic and concept-matching scores to guide data selection and training, resulting in significant performance improvements as evidenced by metrics such as CLIP and CMMD.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a clear presentation of the research problem and motivation.
2. It addresses a significant challenge in text-to-image generation, focusing on OOD concepts from a data-centric perspective.
3. The innovative combination of active learning with a novel scoring system enhances model adaptation.
4. The experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over baseline methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks sufficient detail on how the CMMD metric differs from traditional metrics like Inception Score and FID, necessitating further explanation.
2. The limited training sample size (100 for single-concept and 200 for multi-concept) may bias the generation model; reporting diversity metrics of generated samples could clarify this issue.
3. The empirical evaluations are sparse, with only 25 OOD concepts tested, raising concerns about the robustness of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of how the CMMD metric differs from other commonly-used metrics for image generation. Additionally, reporting diversity metrics of the generated samples would help address potential biases due to the limited training sample size. We suggest conducting more extensive ablation studies on the impact of initial data size and the type of text-to-image encoders to further substantiate the paper's contributions. Lastly, including experiments on the performance of CATOD with other text-to-image models would enhance the generalizability of the findings.
