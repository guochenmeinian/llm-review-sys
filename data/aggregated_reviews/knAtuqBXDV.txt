### Key Points
This paper presents an agent-based framework that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate user interactions with a recommender system, introducing the innovative concept of treating items as agents with their own beliefs. The authors propose that gradient optimization can be simulated through multi-turn interactions. The experiments validate the effectiveness of this approach, demonstrating its performance in sparse data scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The topic is novel and timely, addressing LLM-based recommendation systems.
- The methodology effectively incorporates concepts from agent-based architectures.
- The experimental results are solid and well-presented.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental design includes sub-optimal choices, leading to limited findings.
- Certain key concepts and claims lack sufficient clarity, impacting the paper's overall comprehensibility.
- The complexity of the framework's representation may confuse readers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of crucial concepts and claims to enhance the paper's comprehensibility. Specifically, please clarify the impact of sampling on results and the meaning of "fixed" in relation to the recommendation model. Additionally, we suggest providing more detailed explanations for Figure 1 to better illustrate the role of item agents and the aggregation of simulated preferences. It would also be beneficial to explicitly state the research questions guiding the experiments and to elaborate on the selection rationale for baseline methods. Finally, we encourage the authors to address the interpretability of model decisions and the potential for catastrophic forgetting in memory updates during simulations.
