### Key Points
This paper presents a new metric, FactSpotter, aimed at evaluating factual faithfulness in graph-to-text generation by assessing whether RDF triples are accurately represented in generated text. FactSpotter employs a binary classification model trained on pairs or triples and corresponding texts, achieving strong correlations with human evaluations on factors like correctness and coverage. The authors propose integrating FactSpotter into the decoding process to enhance factuality in generated outputs, demonstrating improvements in factuality scores across various datasets without significant drawbacks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-presented, clearly articulating motivations and methodologies.
- FactSpotter shows strong correlation with human judgments, outperforming existing metrics.
- The integration of the metric into the model during decoding is a creative approach that yields positive results.

Weaknesses:
- The applicability of FactSpotter is limited to RDF triples and specific predicates present in the training data.
- The reliance on automatic metrics may restrict the understanding of factual consistency, necessitating more qualitative analysis and ablation studies.
- The conclusions regarding the challenge level of existing datasets require more robust supporting evidence beyond automatic scores.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of FactSpotter by exploring its extension to data-to-text tasks with different representations. Additionally, conducting ablation studies and qualitative analyses on examples where the metric enhances decoding would provide valuable insights. We also suggest illustrating generated texts and factual scores across distinct datasets to better capture the nuances of factual consistency. Lastly, clarifying the computation of the FactSpotter score and ensuring that the model is not inadvertently biased by training data overlap would strengthen the claims made in the paper.
