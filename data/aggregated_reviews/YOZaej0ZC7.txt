Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on measuring fairness in generative models, focusing on the impact of sensitive attribute (SA) classifiers on fairness measurement. The authors propose a framework called CLassifier Error-Aware Measurement (CLEAM) that utilizes a statistical model to address inaccuracies in SA classifiers, thereby reducing measurement errors. The paper also introduces a dataset of manually labeled samples to evaluate the effectiveness of existing fairness frameworks and demonstrates CLEAM's application in measuring fairness in text-to-image generators and GANs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a strong empirical analysis of fairness measurement in generative models and highlights flaws in existing frameworks.
- CLEAM is an intuitive and novel approach that effectively reduces measurement errors.
- The dataset created will benefit the research community by providing a resource for evaluating fairness in generative models.

Weaknesses:
- The narrative lacks clarity regarding how SA classifiers are obtained, and the assumption of known error rates needs further discussion.
- The notation used in the paper is confusing, particularly regarding the definitions of $Pr(u \mid x)$ and $C_u(x)$, as well as the inconsistent use of $p^{*}$.
- The paper does not sufficiently explore the implications of SA classifier errors on fairness definitions or provide insights into the technical contributions of the proposed mitigation method.
- The presentation could be improved, as some sections are dense and difficult to follow, particularly the introduction of CLEAM and the statistical model.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how SA classifiers are typically obtained and discuss the transferability of their error rates more thoroughly. Additionally, we suggest revising the notation for $Pr(u \mid x)$ and $C_u(x)$ to enhance understanding. The authors should also provide a more detailed explanation of the statistical model and its assumptions, particularly regarding the choice of distributions. Expanding the experimental evaluation to include various datasets and generative models would strengthen the paper's contributions. Finally, we advise revising the abstract for clarity and coherence, ensuring it accurately reflects the paper's goals and findings.
