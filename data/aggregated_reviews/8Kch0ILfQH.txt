Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel addition to the BLIP-2 vision-language pre-training framework through the introduction of the P-Former, a sentence encoder that projects texts into the input space of a large language model (LLM). The authors propose that by applying an additional alignment loss between the visual features of the Q-Former and the text features of the P-Former during pre-training, the alignment with the frozen LLM is enhanced, resulting in improved image-to-text generation performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The exploration of an additional text encoder to improve BLIP-2 pre-training is innovative and could lead to future research opportunities.
- Empirical results indicate significant improvements in image-to-text generation tasks, validating the enhanced alignment with the LLM.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation and problem formulation misrepresent the P-Former's role, which is to serve as a surrogate for the LLM rather than being LLM-agnostic.
- The complexity of the P-Former's pre-training process lacks clarity, necessitating further discussion and ablation studies on the various losses involved.
- The writing quality could be improved; many equations may be unnecessary and complicate understanding, while concepts like "forward-decoupled" and "backward-decoupled" are not intuitive.
- There is a lack of qualitative analysis and comprehensive experiments to clarify the source of performance gains.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation and problem formulation to accurately reflect the P-Former's role. It is essential to highlight the conceptual differences from BLIP-2, particularly regarding the LLM-agnostic claim. Additionally, we suggest including more discussion and ablation studies on the training losses associated with the P-Former. To enhance understanding, consider simplifying the presentation by reducing the number of equations and providing clearer explanations of complex concepts. Finally, we encourage the authors to include qualitative analyses and more comprehensive experiments to elucidate the performance gains achieved with the P-Former.
