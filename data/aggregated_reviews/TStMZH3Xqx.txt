Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CSRO, an offline Meta-RL algorithm designed to address the distributional shift problem in offline meta-reinforcement learning (RL) with online adaptation. CSRO constrains task encoding to include only transition and reward information, avoiding state-action distribution details. It also employs random exploration at the beginning of exploration to mitigate distribution mismatch. Experimental results demonstrate improved performance on MuJoCo task sets. The method optimizes a combination of FOCAL's objective and an adversarial objective to enhance task representation learning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The distributional shift problem is a significant challenge in offline meta-RL with online adaptation.
2. The information-theoretic regularization on task embeddings is novel and compelling.
3. The paper is well-written, clearly presenting its ideas and findings.

Weaknesses:
1. The evaluation tasks are overly simplistic; more complex task distributions like Meta-World ML1 should be considered for a more convincing demonstration.
2. The random exploration strategy may be inefficient, particularly in challenging tasks such as Meta-World or sparse reward environments.
3. Some claims regarding mutual information and context collection lack accuracy and clarity, needing further explanation and justification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including more complex task distributions, such as Meta-World ML1, to better demonstrate CSRO's capabilities. Additionally, we suggest discussing the limitations of the random exploration strategy, particularly its potential inefficiency in sparse reward tasks. The authors should clarify the claims made regarding mutual information in the paper, particularly in relation to Equation 5 and the context collection strategy. Including a figure that illustrates performance drops of prior works when using online exploration could enhance comprehension. Lastly, a comparison with recent works addressing context correction in offline meta-RL would provide valuable context for CSRO's contributions.
