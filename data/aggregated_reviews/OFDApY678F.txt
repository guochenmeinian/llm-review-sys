Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on linear experimental design under heteroskedastic noise, focusing on estimating the unknown covariance matrix and its relation to measurement vectors. The authors propose an algorithm that first constructs a least-squares estimator from half of the samples and then estimates noise and covariance from the remaining samples, achieving a sample complexity that scales quadratically with the dimension \(d\). The approach has applications in best arm identification and level set identification, supported by empirical validation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a relevant problem, as heteroskedastic noise is common in practical settings, making the study of sample complexity and efficient algorithms important.  
- The presentation effectively balances motivation, intuition, and technical detail, making it enjoyable to read.  
- The results obtained are strong and contribute to the understanding of the problem.

Weaknesses:  
- The runtime complexity of the proposed algorithm is not discussed, which is crucial given the existence of efficient algorithms in linear bandits and experimental design.  
- The heteroskedasticity assumption may be overly restrictive, warranting further discussion and potential extension of the algorithm to more general noise settings.  
- The numerical experiments are limited to small toy examples, lacking large-scale evaluations to demonstrate practical effectiveness.  
- Comparisons with previous works are absent, and the motivation for the specific problem setting regarding the dependence of noise variance on the sensing vector is unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the runtime complexity of the proposed algorithm, possibly incorporating insights from recent developments in data-structure-based methods. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a broader discussion on the heteroskedasticity model to justify its assumptions and explore extensions to more general noise settings. Expanding the numerical experiments to include larger-scale scenarios would strengthen the empirical validation of the algorithm. Finally, a comparative analysis with previous works would enhance the paper's contribution and clarity regarding its significance in the field.
