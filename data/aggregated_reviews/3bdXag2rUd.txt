Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel scenario in test-time adaptation (TTA) where non-interest testing samples can mislead the adaptation process. The authors propose the Screening-out Test-Time Adaptation (SoTTA) method, which addresses this issue through two main components: input-wise robustness via high-confidence uniform-class sampling and parameter-wise robustness through entropy-sharpness minimization. The effectiveness of SoTTA is demonstrated through experiments on benchmark datasets, showing state-of-the-art performance compared to existing TTA methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper tackles a practical and relatively novel problem in TTA, focusing on the impact of non-interest samples.
2. The overall concept of filtering harmful samples and employing a robust loss function is sound, and the experimental results indicate significant performance improvements.

Weaknesses:
1. The proposed methods lack novelty, as similar strategies have been previously explored in existing TTA methods like ETA and SAR.
2. The paper does not adequately discuss the selection and sensitivity of the threshold \(C_0\), which is crucial for filtering non-interest samples.
3. Key results, such as those from CIFAR100 and ImageNet-C, are not presented in the main text, limiting the comprehensiveness of the analysis.
4. The methodology section may lack originality, and there are typographical errors that need correction.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the differences between their proposed methods and existing TTA methods, particularly ETA and SAR, to highlight the novelty of their approach. Additionally, the authors should include a discussion on the selection and sensitivity of the threshold \(C_0\) and provide comprehensive results for all datasets in the main paper. A theoretical analysis of the motivation and methods would also strengthen the paper. Finally, addressing typographical errors and considering segmentation tasks in their experiments would enhance the overall quality of the manuscript.
