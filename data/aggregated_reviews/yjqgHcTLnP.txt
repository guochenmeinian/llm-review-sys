### Key Points
This paper presents a new 3D object localization dataset, ARKitSceneRefer, which focuses on small objects in indoor scenes, building upon the existing ARKitScenes dataset. The authors compare their dataset with existing ones and evaluate state-of-the-art 2D and 3D models on it. The dataset includes 15,553 referring expressions across 1,605 scenes, addressing the significant challenge of small object identification for embodied agents and virtual assistants.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivations for the dataset are clear, addressing an important unsolved problem in small object identification.
- The dataset is larger than previous 3D referring expression datasets, enhancing its utility for research.
- The paper is well-written and provides an intuitive explanation of the authors' approach.

Weaknesses:
- The quality of the 3D scenes in ARKitScenes is low, raising concerns about the detectability of small objects.
- The multiple choice annotation format limits annotators' ability to indicate if they cannot locate an object, potentially affecting annotation quality.
- The dataset lacks diversity in object expressions, as each object is described with only one expression, which may impact its effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the quality of the 3D scenes in ARKitScenes to ensure better small object representations. Additionally, consider revising the annotation format to allow annotators to indicate when they cannot locate an object. It would also be beneficial to include a discussion on the challenge of multiple objects with the same class in the dataset and to validate the dataset using more diverse state-of-the-art models. Lastly, we suggest performing experiments comparing different model architectures to demonstrate the importance of 3D scenes in the task.
