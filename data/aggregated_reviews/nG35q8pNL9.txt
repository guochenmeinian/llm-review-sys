Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive study on the dynamics gap in trajectory prediction models and its impact on driving performance in autonomous driving. The authors assert that this gap significantly influences evaluation outcomes, which has been overlooked in previous research. They propose that the discrepancy between prediction performance and real-world driving performance arises from static datasets and computational efficiency issues. The authors introduce dynamic ADE/FDE as new metrics to assess this gap, arguing that these metrics correlate better with closed-loop driving performance than traditional static metrics. The study employs various trajectory prediction models and planners, providing a quantitative analysis that demonstrates the substantial effect of the dynamics gap on driving performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The experiments are well-designed, covering a variety of trajectory prediction models and planners, providing strong evidence for the claims made.
- The paper effectively identifies and discusses the dynamics gap, contributing a fresh perspective to prediction evaluation.
- The use of dynamic ADE/FDE metrics is a promising approach to highlight the limitations of traditional evaluation methods.
- The writing is clear, and the presentation of findings is visually and numerically effective.
- The authors are actively working on releasing code to facilitate reproducibility and further research.

Weaknesses:
- The work does not propose a novel method but rather surveys existing approaches, which may render some findings somewhat obvious.
- The core Dynamic ADE/FDE metrics lack clarity and dedicated explanation, which diminishes their impact.
- The realism of the SUMMIT simulator is not adequately validated, raising concerns about the reliability of the results and their applicability to real-world scenarios.
- Some experimental conclusions are based on limited data points, leading to potentially weak statistical support.
- The practical utility of dynamic ADE/FDE for practitioners in building prediction systems remains unclear.
- The interplay between dynamic ADE and computation time is considered somewhat obvious, which may reduce the impact of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the Dynamic ADE/FDE metrics by providing a dedicated section with illustrations. Additionally, we suggest including a literature review on traffic simulation and evaluation metrics to contextualize the findings. To strengthen the validity of the SUMMIT simulator, the authors should provide additional results that justify its realism in closed-loop evaluations. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore other factors contributing to the discrepancy in trajectory prediction and driving performance, as well as to enhance the depth of analysis in their experiments. We also recommend improving the emphasis on the significance of their main contributions in the main text to enhance the perceived novelty of the work. Consider moving the motion model evaluation idea and Sim-Real Alignment experiment to the supplementary material, as suggested. Finally, ensure that the code for reproducing experiments is made available promptly to support future research in motion prediction.
