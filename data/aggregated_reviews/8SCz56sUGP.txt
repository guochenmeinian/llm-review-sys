Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to real-world super-resolution (SR) by framing it as a multi-task learning problem, addressing the task competition issue inherent in handling various degradation types. The authors propose a task grouping strategy to mitigate this competition and introduce the TGSR (task grouping-based real-SR network) to manage these grouped tasks effectively. They emphasize that real-SR networks are trained to handle numerous degradation tasks simultaneously, which can lead to task conflict due to limited model capacity. Experimental results indicate significant performance improvements across diverse degradation types, and results on real-world images from the Realworld38 dataset are included in the supplementary material, addressing concerns about the absence of such results in the main paper.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a fresh perspective on real-SR by treating it as a multi-task learning challenge, which could lead to deeper insights into degradation sampling and task relationships.
- The formulation of real-SR as a multi-task learning problem is rigorous and well-articulated.
- Clear evidence is provided regarding the model's performance across different degradation tasks.
- A clear motivation is provided regarding task competition, highlighting limitations of current real-SR networks.
- Inclusion of real-world image results in the supplementary material enhances the paper's credibility.
- Extensive ablation studies reveal that traditional blind super-resolution methods may not be effective in large degradation spaces, presenting a valuable finding.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a detailed selection strategy for different degradation tasks, particularly in Section 3.1 and Figure 1.
- Initial descriptions of "task" and "task conflict" may be perceived as unconvincing or intuitive.
- Hyper-parameters in the task grouping strategy are fixed without sufficient motivation or analysis, raising concerns about their impact.
- The manual determination of thresholds for group divisions lacks ablation studies, potentially leading to imprecision.
- The evaluation data, DIV2K5G, is closely tied to the TGSR model, raising concerns about inherent bias; independent evaluations on standard benchmark datasets are recommended.
- The oversight in not mentioning the Realworld38 dataset in the main paper could lead to confusion regarding the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the selection strategy for degradation tasks and provide detailed settings for each task to enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest conducting comprehensive analyses or ablation studies on the fixed hyper-parameters to justify their choices. It would be beneficial to evaluate the TGSR model on standard benchmark datasets and real-world data to provide a more independent measure of effectiveness. We also encourage the authors to clarify the relationship between task grouping and degradation distribution to strengthen the rationale behind their approach. Finally, we recommend that the authors explicitly mention the Realworld38 dataset in the main paper to avoid any oversight regarding the real-world image results.
