Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a local search algorithm for constructing $\ell_2$-volumetric spanners, achieving a spanner of size at most $3d$ with a runtime of $O(d \log d)$. The authors extend their results to $\ell_p$ norms for any $p \ge 1$ and demonstrate applications to the minimum volume enclosing ellipsoid (MVEE) problem, providing coresets of size $O(d/\epsilon)$, which is an improvement over previous methods. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed algorithm is straightforward and the paper is well-written, making it easy to follow.
- The results are significant if the proofs hold, particularly in the context of large datasets where small spanning subsets are beneficial.
- The algorithm shows improvements in the size of coresets for MVEE compared to existing literature.

Weaknesses:
- The improvement in spanner size is modest compared to prior work, and the algorithm resembles known approaches, raising concerns about originality.
- The running time for the $\ell_2$-volumetric spanner is worse than that of [Woodruff and Yasuda'23] by a factor of $d \log d$.
- The paper lacks clarity in comparing results with existing literature, making it difficult to assess the degree of improvement.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of comparisons with prior work by including a table that summarizes the size of volumetric spanners, the number of iterations, and running times. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explicitly state the aspects of improvement over previous algorithms, particularly concerning the running time and approximation ratios. It would also be beneficial to provide a clearer description of the degree of optimality of both their results and those of previous attempts.
