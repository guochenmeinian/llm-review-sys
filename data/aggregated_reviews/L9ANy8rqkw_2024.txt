Aggregated Review:
**Key Points**  
We find that the paper introduces an innovative framework for long-term human motion prediction by integrating VQ-VAE and diffusion policy, which is well-suited for the problem at hand. The authors present a robust framework that combines Hierarchical Action Quantization (HAQ), Action Diffusion Policy, and Reachability Guidance, enhancing the realism and feasibility of generated trajectories. The evaluation across two publicly available datasets demonstrates superior performance compared to several baselines.

**Strengths and Weaknesses**  
Strengths include the innovative approach that incorporates physical constraints, a comprehensive framework for nuanced modeling of human behaviors, extensive evaluation using both common and novel metrics, and significant theoretical and practical contributions to human-robot interaction. However, weaknesses involve a dependency on accurate physical modeling of human dynamics, which could affect trajectory predictions, and a lack of exploration regarding the model's generalization across different environments or more dynamic scenarios.

**Suggestions for Improvement**  
We suggest improving the clarity of texts in the figures and exploring additional conditions such as social and scene contexts to enhance the model's applicability and robustness.
