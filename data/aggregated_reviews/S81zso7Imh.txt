### Key Points
This paper presents a method called “Image Captioning by Committee Consensus” (IC3) that generates a single comprehensive caption by synthesizing multiple short captions from a pretrained image captioning model and leveraging a large language model (LLM). The authors demonstrate that IC3 produces captions rated higher in helpfulness and correctness through detailed human evaluation, and automated measures indicate that these captions contain significantly more semantic information than baseline captions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well written and easy to follow.  
- The approach is well thought out and supported by a detailed human evaluation study.  
- The automatic evaluation results indicate that IC3 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) captions.  

Weaknesses:  
- The approach may suffer from LLM weaknesses, such as hallucinations.  
- The model lacks controllability and fails to adequately describe background or contextual information.  
- Core indicators like BLEU-1, BLEU-4, METR, and CIDEr are not reported, and there is insufficient comparison with mainstream image captioning models.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis in the paper and supplement it with core indicator experiments to demonstrate the innovation and progressiveness of their methods. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the clarity of Figure 2 or adding a framework diagram to better introduce the model. It would also be beneficial to include comparisons with recent image captioning models, such as BLIP-2, to contextualize the improvements offered by IC3.
