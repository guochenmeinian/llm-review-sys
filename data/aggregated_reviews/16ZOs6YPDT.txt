### Key Points
This paper presents methods for detecting semantic differences in words across two corpora, utilizing pre-trained contextual word vectors. The authors propose a straightforward approach based on counting the norm of mean vectors, introducing a coefficient termed "coverage" for comparison. The methods effectively reveal semantic shifts and differences in parts of speech, particularly between native and non-native English usages. The study includes experiments on English corpora from different time periods and speaker backgrounds, demonstrating strong results comparable to more complex methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed methods are simple yet effective, with a solid mathematical foundation.
- The paper includes both quantitative and qualitative analyses, enhancing its contributions.
- Codes are provided, facilitating reproducibility of the results.
- The work has potential applications in various fields, including second language acquisition.

Weaknesses:
- The study is limited to English corpora; exploring other languages could provide valuable insights.
- The reliance on a monolingual language model may restrict the detection of semantic shifts over broader time periods.
- Some assumptions, such as the constancy of word forms, may not hold true in all contexts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the exploration of their methods across different languages and contexts, particularly in relation to non-native speakers' mother tongues. Additionally, addressing the limitations associated with the use of a large language model and its implications for semantic shift detection would strengthen the paper. Clarifying the algorithm in section 2.2 regarding the definition of representativeness and weights would also enhance the clarity of the methodology.
