Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of probabilistic integral circuits (PICs) from tree-shaped to directed acyclic graph (DAG)-shaped structures, significantly enhancing their expressiveness and representation of distributions. The authors propose a pipeline for converting region graphs into PICs, then into a quasi-probabilistic circuit (QPC), which is further optimized through tensorization and functional sharing techniques to improve efficiency and scalability. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional probabilistic circuits (PCs) in density estimation tasks and scales effectively to complex datasets like ImageNet64.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The extension to DAG-shaped PICs greatly improves expressiveness and scalability.
- The paper is technically sound, well-structured, and easy to follow, with clear arguments and effective illustrations.
- Empirical results validate the efficiency of the proposed methods, showing reduced parameter counts and resource consumption compared to traditional PCs.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the paper may be questioned as many components are adaptations of existing ideas in the literature.
- Clarity issues arise regarding the dataset used for experiments and the number of random variables modeled.
- The inability to sample from PICs limits their applicability as generative models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by specifying the dataset used in the "Scaling PICs" experiments and detailing the number of random variables modeled. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include a comparison of density estimation performance between PIC (F, N) and PIC (F, C) to illustrate potential performance trade-offs. We also suggest providing a toy example to enhance accessibility and understanding of the algorithmic details, particularly regarding integral units and the reduction from PICs to QPCs. Lastly, addressing the questions regarding the significance of the tree vs. DAG shape for empirical expressiveness and the implications of using a consistent quadrature rule would strengthen the paper.
