### Key Points
This paper presents the Iterative Bias-Aware Dataset Refinement (IBADR) framework, aimed at debiasing NLU models through dataset refinement methods. It introduces an iterative process where a shallow model identifies biases in samples, and a generator produces pseudo samples with fewer biased features. The authors claim that IBADR significantly improves both in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance compared to existing methods, without relying on predefined biased features or human annotations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed framework is simple and intuitive, addressing the human cost problem in dataset refinement.
- It demonstrates strong experimental results, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in debiasing benchmarks.
- The paper is well-organized and generally clear, contributing valuable insights into dataset refinement.

Weaknesses:
- The authors do not perform significance testing on their claims of superior performance.
- The experimental results on MNLI-hard and SNLI-hard datasets are insufficient.
- There is a lack of comprehensive analysis regarding the sample generator, including qualitative assessments and the impact of augmented data on performance.
- The iterative nature of the refinement process incurs high computational costs, raising concerns about scalability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve their analysis of the sample generator by providing qualitative assessments of generated examples and exploring the effects of varying the number of augmented samples. Additionally, we suggest conducting significance testing to substantiate claims of performance improvements over baselines. The authors should also clarify the computational costs associated with their method and address the scalability of the framework, particularly in relation to the amount of augmented data required to achieve comparable performance with existing debiasing techniques.
