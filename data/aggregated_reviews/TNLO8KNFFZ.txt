Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a fitted surrogate neural network model to approximate the Fisher information metric induced by the retinal ganglion cell population code. The authors argue that noise correlations in the retina are information-limiting, based on their analysis of the Fisher information matrix and its eigenvectors. They find that the most discriminable stimulus varies with the base point, suggesting a link to neural adaptation, although this connection is acknowledged as a potential topic for future study. Additionally, the authors propose a two-step optimization procedure for modeling sensitivity and stochasticity in the visual system, emphasizing the impracticality of optimizing second-order statistics alongside mean firing rates. Their method, which fixes deterministic properties while optimizing noise inputs, yields an accurate model of second-order statistics and effectively captures the true function of the retina. The authors discuss the mechanistic implications of their noise model, suggesting that Gaussian noise is a suitable representation of various biophysical noise sources in the retinal circuitry.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a classic question in theoretical and systems neuroscience regarding noise correlations in early sensory areas.  
- It offers a novel approach to Fisher information estimation, with good fits to experimental data and a grounding in current neuroscientific theories.  
- The two-step optimization procedure is innovative and yields accurate results for modeling sensitivity and stochasticity.  
- The clear writing style and conceptual simplicity of the model and eigenvector analyses enhance understanding.  
- The mechanistic interpretability of the model is highlighted, providing insights into the underlying biophysical processes.  

Weaknesses:  
- Concerns exist regarding the robustness of conclusions to the surrogate model's architecture and goodness of fit, particularly in relation to the accuracy of estimates for maximal variation directions.  
- The assumption of neglecting stimulus-dependence of noise covariance lacks direct evidence for the retinal population code.  
- Some modeling choices appear ad hoc, and the results may depend on these choices, raising questions about their generalizability.  
- The investigation of the noise model is not thorough enough, and additional noise models should be explored.  
- The similarities of the CNN to previous work were not clearly articulated, lacking appropriate explanations and references.  
- The presentation of model training and optimization strategies is somewhat confusing, and the mechanistic connections of the stochastic model to biophysical processes require further clarification.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the robustness of their conclusions by providing evidence that their approach yields accurate estimates of maximal variation directions and that the surrogate model is not overfit. Additionally, direct evidence supporting the assumption of constant noise covariance across stimulus variations should be included. We suggest that the authors enhance the investigation of the noise model by exploring additional possible noise models to strengthen their findings. Clarifying the model's architecture and optimization procedures, possibly with pseudo code, would enhance understanding. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors provide clearer explanations and references regarding the similarities of their CNN to previous work. Enhancing the discussion on the mechanistic connections of the stochastic model to biophysical processes, beyond general terms like “synaptic noise” or “refractory period,” would be beneficial. Finally, addressing the clarity of the presentation, particularly in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, would benefit the overall readability of the paper.
