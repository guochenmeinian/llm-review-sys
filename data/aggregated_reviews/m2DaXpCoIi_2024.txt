Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to the compression of unordered objects through recursive shuffle coding and incomplete shuffle coding. The authors propose these methods to address the high computational cost of automorphism group calculations and to enhance the compression of large unordered data structures. The recursive shuffle allows for one-shot compression, achieving competitive speeds and state-of-the-art compression rates on various large network graphs. However, the recursive shuffle mechanism's reliance on computing orbits of prefixes limits its polynomial time completion.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The compression problem addressed is relevant and applicable to various graph compression scenarios.
- The recursive process interleaves encoding and decoding steps, allowing for one-shot compression while avoiding the joint compression of all order information, which is innovative.
- The paper is well-written, with clear proof arguments and comprehensive numerical simulations comparing the proposed methods against state-of-the-art techniques.

Weaknesses:
- The recursive shuffle mechanism's requirement for orbit computation cannot be solved in polynomial time, and the alternative method is suboptimal regarding compression rates.
- Experimental results show that the proposed methods do not consistently outperform SZIP and Plane shuffle methods, with SZIP often yielding better performance in terms of compression rate and speed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the connection between recursive shuffle coding and incomplete shuffle coding. Additionally, the authors should provide a more explicit and comprehensive comparison with SZIP in Section 6, addressing the conditions under which their methods outperform SZIP. It would also be beneficial to discuss the limitations associated with the autoregressive probability model in greater detail. Finally, we suggest plotting the results in Figure S1 on a log or log-log scale to enhance clarity.
