### Key Points
This paper presents the Variational Markovian Option Critic (VMOC), an off-policy algorithm for hierarchical reinforcement learning that aims to enhance exploration efficiency and update stability. The authors propose using variational inference for update stabilization and low-cost option embeddings for scalability. The method is evaluated on Mujoco environments, showing improved performance compared to existing on-policy and off-policy methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with a clear theoretical justification for the proposed method.
- Empirical evaluations demonstrate favorable results against several competitors across multiple Mujoco environments.

Weaknesses:
- The originality of the approach is limited, as similar ideas have been previously proposed, making the contribution appear incremental.
- The empirical evaluations lack depth, particularly in the absence of ablation studies, which hinders understanding of the method's performance relative to various baselines.
- The presentation suffers from clarity issues, including repeated section titles and incomplete sentences, which detract from the overall quality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by addressing the formatting issues, such as the repeated section titles and incomplete sentences. Additionally, we suggest including ablation studies to better illustrate the contributions of the proposed method and its performance compared to both hierarchical and flat off-policy methods. It would also be beneficial to analyze the learned options and discuss the implications of the number of options chosen for the experiments. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore comparisons in discrete environments to assess the generalizability of their findings.
