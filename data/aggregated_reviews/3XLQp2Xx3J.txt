Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents GS-Hider, a novel framework for steganography in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models. The key innovation is a coupled secured feature attribute that replaces the original spherical harmonics coefficients, enabling the embedding of hidden 3D scenes or images into the original scene without compromising rendering quality. The framework employs a scene decoder and a message decoder to disentangle original and hidden information. The authors demonstrate GS-Hider's effectiveness through extensive experiments, showing its ability to conceal multiple 3D scenes or single images while maintaining high fidelity, security, and robustness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- GS-Hider is the first framework specifically designed for 3D Gaussian Splatting, addressing a significant challenge in protecting 3D assets.
- The coupled secured feature attribute and parallel decoder architecture effectively balance security, fidelity, and computational efficiency.
- The method demonstrates versatility by hiding both 3D scenes and 2D images, making it applicable in various contexts.
- Comprehensive evaluations validate the framework's performance across fidelity, security, robustness, and capacity.
- The method maintains near real-time rendering speeds (45 fps), which is crucial for practical applications.

Weaknesses:
- The additional computational overhead from the scene decoder undermines the speed advantage of Gaussian splatting, as the authors do not report FPS-related metrics or compare them with the original 3DGS.
- The decoder is trained per scene, suggesting it may "memorize" scene watermarks, raising concerns about generalizability.
- There is a lack of theoretical justification for the effectiveness of the coupled feature representation.
- The paper could benefit from comparisons with more recent steganography methods and broader datasets beyond Mip-NeRF360.
- Limitations regarding view-dependency and rendering quality are acknowledged but could be more thoroughly discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the computational overhead introduced by the scene decoder by providing FPS metrics for all experiments to assess practical usage impacts. Additionally, we suggest demonstrating that the hidden scene is not merely memorized by the decoder, possibly by training a general decoder applicable to multiple scenes. Expanding the comparison to include recent steganography methods and testing on a wider range of 3D scenes would enhance the robustness of the findings. Finally, a more in-depth exploration of potential misuse scenarios and mitigation strategies in the broader impacts section would strengthen the paper's ethical considerations.
