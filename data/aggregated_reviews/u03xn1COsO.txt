Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the zero-shot learning capabilities of ChatGPT across 20 popular NLP datasets, spanning seven task categories. The authors evaluate ChatGPT's performance against the previous GPT-3.5 model and other models, focusing on its strengths and limitations in various NLP tasks. Key findings indicate that while ChatGPT shows promise as a generalist model, it often underperforms compared to task-specific fine-tuned models, particularly in commonsense and logical reasoning tasks. The study employs a two-stage prompting approach for zero-shot completion of tasks, generating insights into the model's capabilities and guiding future research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Comprehensive evaluation of ChatGPT's zero-shot learning ability across diverse NLP tasks.
- Clear writing and presentation of findings, making it accessible to readers.
- Empirical analysis provides valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of ChatGPT.
- The exploration of zero-shot Chain-of-Thought Prompting reveals its variable impact on performance.

Weaknesses:
- Limited scope of investigated prompting techniques, focusing solely on zero-shot Chain-of-Thought.
- Potential lack of novelty, as existing literature on ChatGPT's evaluation is not adequately referenced.
- The paper does not consider performance on tasks requiring fine-tuning or transfer learning.
- Limited generalizability due to exclusion of larger-scale datasets and comparison with other state-of-the-art models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the scope of their investigation by incorporating a broader range of prompting techniques, such as zero-shot Chain-of-Thought with self-consistency or tool augmentation. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the Related Work section to include relevant preprints that evaluate ChatGPT on similar datasets. To bolster generalizability, consider including larger-scale datasets and tasks that require fine-tuning. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the specific version of ChatGPT used for evaluations to aid reproducibility.
