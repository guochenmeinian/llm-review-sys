Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a controllable model reassembly approach, termed `pFedClub`, to facilitate heterogeneous model cooperation in personalized federated learning. The method addresses key challenges such as personalization, privacy concerns, and uncontrolled model size growth through a structured process of model decomposition, clustering via K-means, and optimal model selection for clients. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method across various datasets and settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-organized and clearly motivated, with a logical structure that enhances comprehension. The framework and figures improve readability, and the experiments robustly support the claims made.
2. The focus on controllability and efficiency makes the algorithm applicable in real-world scenarios, allowing for greater human involvement in model generation.
3. Comprehensive experiments, including hyperparameter evaluations and ablation studies, confirm the validity of the techniques and provide deep insights into the contributions of the paper.

Weaknesses:
1. The algorithm's operations, including reassembly and matching, may impose a significant computational burden compared to approaches without controllability.
2. The selection criteria for the anchor block need clearer articulation.
3. The applicability of the approach to public datasets, particularly in terms of robustness with or without labels, remains unclear.
4. The writing and structure require improvement, particularly in clarifying the concept of order in the "Order-constrained Block Search" section.
5. The meaning of 'CKA' in equation (1) is not defined, raising privacy concerns regarding data transmission to the server.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the anchor block selection process and provide a detailed explanation of the criteria used. Additionally, the authors should address how the value of K is selected and its influence on results, particularly in relation to the K-means clustering method. It would be beneficial to explore the applicability of the proposed method beyond image classification, potentially validating it on Transformer-based architectures. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors enhance the writing and structure of the paper, particularly in defining key terms and clarifying the sampling process for anchor block selection. Finally, addressing the privacy concerns related to data transmission and the dimensions of features in equation (1) would significantly improve the paper's rigor and readability.
