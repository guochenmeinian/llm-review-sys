Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on decentralized optimization for non-smooth convex objectives within time-varying networks. The authors propose an algorithm that optimally bounds the complexity of solving this problem and provide matching lower bounds on communication and subgradient computations, demonstrating the algorithm's optimality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well-written, clearly explaining the concepts and addressing a relevant research question by proposing an optimal algorithm with corresponding lower bounds. The theoretical contributions are significant, resolving an open problem in the field.

Weaknesses:  
Despite the theoretical guarantees, optimization algorithms may yield unsatisfactory performance, and the absence of numerical simulations to validate the proposed algorithm's performance is noted. Additionally, the paper's density may hinder accessibility, with most proofs relegated to the appendix. Minor issues include the need for clearer explanations of the algorithm steps and several typographical errors.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper's accessibility by reducing its density and providing more intuitive guidance through the proofs in the main text. Including a simulation example to showcase the algorithm's performance on a relevant problem would enhance the paper. Furthermore, clarifying the correspondence between algorithm steps and their descriptions in lines 282-296 would aid comprehension. We also suggest addressing the minor typographical errors identified and discussing the limitations of the assumptions made in the paper more explicitly.
