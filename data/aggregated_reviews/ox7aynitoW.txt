Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output Neural Networks (MIMONets), which enable simultaneous processing of multiple inputs to reduce computational costs. The authors introduce two variants: MIMOConv for CNNs and MIMOFormer for Transformers. MIMONets utilize computation superposition and fixed-width distributed representations, achieving a balance between accuracy and throughput. Empirical evaluations indicate significant speed improvements while maintaining high accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. MIMONets effectively reduce computational costs by combining multiple inputs into a single sample, which is beneficial for practical applications.
2. The method demonstrates versatility across both CNN and Transformer architectures, yielding promising results.

Weaknesses:
1. The concept of superposition may lead to interference between inputs, potentially affecting accuracy.
2. The experimental scope is limited, with a need for validation on larger datasets like ImageNet and a broader range of network architectures.
3. A noticeable accuracy drop occurs when processing multiple inputs, raising concerns for applications requiring high precision.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental validation by applying MIMONets to more diverse datasets and network architectures. Additionally, the authors should provide a detailed mathematical description of the bind/unbind operations, including dimensions and indexes, and clarify the computational complexity in Tables 1 and 2. It would also be beneficial to compare MIMONets with related work, such as the DataMUX paper, and discuss similarities and differences. Finally, we suggest addressing the performance drop observed with multiple inputs by exploring alternative methods like pruning and quantization, and providing insights into the dynamic inference process.
