### Key Points
This paper presents LIRA (Learning-based Query-aware Partition Framework), an innovative framework aimed at optimizing the efficiency and accuracy of large-scale Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search. LIRA introduces a learning-based redundancy strategy and a query-aware probing model to reduce partition probing redundancy and address the long-tail effect. Experimental results indicate that LIRA achieves over a 30% improvement in query latency and fan-out compared to existing methods. The framework is well-structured and provides comprehensive experimental results, particularly in large dataset evaluations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Well-motivated with detailed illustrations that enhance credibility.
- Clear presentation and structure, making the paper easy to follow.
- Abundant experiments demonstrating effectiveness, especially in scale-up evaluations.

Weaknesses:
- Limited novelty, primarily building on existing methods with incremental improvements.
- Insufficient theoretical analysis regarding algorithm complexity, which is crucial for scalability.
- Technical presentation could be clearer and more structured for better comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation section by providing a more comprehensive explanation of the long-tailed distribution of kNN. Additionally, a detailed theoretical analysis of the algorithm's complexity should be included to clarify its scalability. The technical sections would benefit from clearer explanations and a more structured presentation. We also suggest including more advanced deep learning-based ANN methods as baselines for a comprehensive performance comparison. Conducting ablation studies on key components, such as the learning-based redundancy strategy and the query-aware probing model, will help quantify their impact on overall performance. Finally, clarifying the example in Section 3.3 with more intuitive illustrations or a step-by-step walkthrough would enhance comprehensibility.
