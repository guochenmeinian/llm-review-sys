Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Adversarial Robust Decision Transformer (ARDT), which enhances robustness in sequential decision-making by aligning policies with worst-case scenarios learned through minimax expectile regression. The authors propose a novel approach that outperforms existing Decision Transformer (DT) methods in robustness against adversaries across various data coverage scenarios, including sequential games.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The formulation of adversarial robust DT with minimax return is clear and sound.  
- The motivation is well-founded, and the idea is novel and presented intriguingly.  
- Experimental results demonstrate superior robustness compared to existing DT and ESPER methods.  
- The paper is well-presented with exhaustive experimental details.  

Weaknesses:  
- The need for two additional returns-to-go networks for return re-labeling increases computational burden.  
- The trade-off between robustness to adversaries and policy conservativeness is not discussed.  
- Lack of ablation studies, particularly regarding the effect of hyperparameter \(\alpha\) on performance.  
- Several proposed attacks on reinforcement learning have not been applied in experimental settings.  
- The paper does not consider randomness, which is common in real-world scenarios.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the trade-off between robustness and policy conservativeness. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons of ARDT to baselines in normal cases, not just worst-case scenarios, to assess performance trade-offs. A comprehensive literature review on robust reinforcement learning should be provided, detailing similarities and differences with existing works. We also encourage the authors to conduct ablation studies to demonstrate how varying \(\alpha\) affects performance and to include experiments that account for stochastic transitions. Finally, correcting typographical errors such as "estiation" to "estimation" and "deatils" to "details" is necessary for clarity.
