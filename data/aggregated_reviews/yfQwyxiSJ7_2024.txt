Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents AutoPalette, a dataset distillation method that minimizes color redundancy at both the individual image and overall dataset levels. The authors propose a palette network that reduces color information in images and a color-guided initialization strategy to enhance dataset efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the method's effectiveness compared to existing approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method outperforms other dataset distillation methods in most tasks, providing a new perspective on dataset distillation.
- The methodology is well-defined, with clear explanations of the palette network and color-guided initialization strategy.
- The experiments and ablation studies are comprehensive and convincingly demonstrate the approach's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks detailed explanations of the color loss and palette balance loss, particularly regarding the balance achieved by the palette balance loss.
- There is confusion regarding the definition of color bits, as the original image should have 24 bits rather than 8 bits.
- The evaluation is primarily based on small datasets like CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, raising concerns about the method's performance on larger datasets such as ImageNet-1K.
- Limited exploration of how the method handles imbalanced datasets or classes with unique color distributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the color loss and palette balance loss explanations, particularly the rationale behind the palette balance loss. Additionally, we suggest including a summary of the framework in the main text when introducing the method, rather than only in the last section. It would also be beneficial to discuss the impact of the method on larger datasets and provide more detailed descriptions of how the limitations might affect results. Finally, addressing the confusion regarding color bits and exploring the method's performance on imbalanced datasets would enhance the paper's robustness.
