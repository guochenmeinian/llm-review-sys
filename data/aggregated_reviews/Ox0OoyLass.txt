### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the generalization ability of language embedding models regarding syntactic contexts in natural language processing. The authors propose a new benchmark, LSR, which evaluates three syntactic dimensions: "Lexical compositionality," "Structural heuristics," and "Relational understanding." Their analysis indicates that current text embedding models struggle with these syntactic challenges, and they introduce a data augmentation method aimed at enhancing model performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The manuscript proposes a robust benchmark with a well-reasoned hypothesis to assess the syntactic capabilities of language models, derived from diverse real-world sentence structures.
2. The benchmark addresses three critical aspects essential for syntactic generalization.
3. The authors provide a comprehensive analysis of results, reinforcing their hypotheses and offering valuable insights.

Weaknesses:
1. The related work section lacks references to recent studies on syntax generalization, which could strengthen the paper's arguments through direct comparisons.
2. The proposed data augmentation method is not compared with recent techniques, limiting its contextual effectiveness.
3. The paper does not convincingly substantiate claims regarding prior evaluations' failures to detect model ineffectiveness, nor does it clearly differentiate its benchmark from earlier works.
4. The reported ~83% agreement rate between human and AI annotators may not be robust enough for evaluating large language models.
5. The paper lacks specificity regarding the version and date of the ChatGPT model used for data generation, which may affect applicability.
6. Certain claims, such as model performance on foundational datasets, lack supporting results or citations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section by including recent studies on syntax generalization to enhance the manuscript's rigor. Additionally, the authors should compare their data augmentation method with recent techniques to provide a clearer context for its effectiveness. Clarifying how their benchmark differs from prior works and substantiating claims about evaluation failures with evidence would strengthen the paper. We also suggest providing more details on the reliability of the generated sentences and the specifics of the ChatGPT model used. Lastly, we encourage the authors to highlight the best results in the tables for better clarity.
