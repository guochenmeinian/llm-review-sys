### Key Points
This paper presents the TRuLer approach for transfer rule learning over knowledge graphs (KGs), which effectively transfers rules from a source KG to a target KG by leveraging structural connections encoded via graphlet degree vectors and a message-passing-like procedure. The experimental evaluation demonstrates TRuLer's scalability and competitive performance on various link prediction benchmarks, outperforming existing rule transfer methods. However, the paper lacks insights on optimal exploitation of TRuLer, particularly regarding the choice of source KG and the mining process.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Introduces a novel framework that combines structural similarity and transfer learning for rule extraction.
- Demonstrates good performance and scalability on large KGs, including diverse datasets.
- Well-structured presentation with clear reasoning for methodological choices.

Weaknesses:
- The framework relies heavily on structural similarity, potentially limiting its applicability in cases where semantic relationships are crucial.
- The experimental evaluation does not adequately address the impact of source domain characteristics or the quality of transferred rules.
- Lacks ablation studies to clarify the contributions of individual components and uses outdated baseline models for comparison.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental evaluation by explaining the rationale for using FB15K as the source KG and providing details on the time taken to mine initial rules. Additionally, the authors should consider including a study on the impact of source domain characteristics and mining extraction settings on rule quality. It would be beneficial to clarify the definition of support for \(\epsilon\)-neighbour relations and exemplify how to compute the support of edges TH and LP. Furthermore, incorporating ablation studies and updating baseline comparisons to include more recent rule learning models would enhance the paper's robustness. Lastly, we suggest exploring the handling of long-tail issues in knowledge graphs and considering a more conventional train-test split for future evaluations.
