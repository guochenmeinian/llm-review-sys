### Key Points
This paper presents FMNet, an end-to-end deep learning approach for multi-instance point cloud registration, featuring an attention-weighted feature matching module that adaptively focuses on reliable point correspondences. Unlike traditional methods, FMNet jointly learns feature extraction and matching within a unified network, utilizing an attention mechanism to compute matching probabilities through scaled dot-product. The integration of geometric and cycle consistency losses contributes to its state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, demonstrating robustness against noise and occlusions. Additionally, the paper introduces a 3D focusing-and-matching technique that narrows down the matching space before performing pairwise registrations, outperforming existing methods in recall and precision metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The attention-weighted feature matching module enhances robust matching by focusing on important point pairs, surpassing previous hand-crafted strategies.
2. The FMNet framework is well-designed with clear mathematical explanations, supported by extensive evaluations demonstrating strong empirical evidence.
3. The methodology is clearly articulated, with a well-structured presentation that connects concepts fluently.

Weaknesses:
1. The authors' contributions are not clearly summarized, leading to ambiguity.
2. The network's structure is perceived as overly rigid, detracting from its innovative aspects.
3. The paper lacks effective extraction and utilization of density information, which is crucial for multi-instance alignment.
4. The theoretical depth appears limited compared to previous works, with an abundance of formulas that may obscure understanding.
5. The method's approach of finding the center point first is seen as time-consuming, and the authors do not discuss the computational complexity of their method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions by summarizing them in bullet points. Additionally, enhancing the extraction and utilization of density information would strengthen the paper's impact. A detailed analysis of the inference time in relation to the two-stage structure should be included, along with a discussion on the computational complexity of the method. Furthermore, providing additional experimental results related to the 3D focusing module and clarifying the metrics used for evaluation would enhance the paper's rigor. Lastly, we suggest predicting additional pair-wise confidence scores to address issues with falsely detected objects.
