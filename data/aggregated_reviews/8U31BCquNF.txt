Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for learning safety constraints from expert demonstrations using inverse constraint learning (ICL) in a multi-task setting. The authors frame the problem as a zero-sum game involving a policy player and a constraint player, extending concepts from inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and constrained reinforcement learning (CRL). They derive convergence bounds for learned constraints and demonstrate their approach through simulations in high-dimensional robotics tasks. Additionally, the authors provide a comparative analysis of their method against that of Chou et al., arguing that their approach is more flexible and applicable to real-world problems, as it does not require prior knowledge of the constraint family and can handle longer horizon tasks, with empirical evaluations showing superior performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a sound and innovative framing of the problem as a game, effectively integrating concepts from IRL, CRL, and game theory.
- The method shows potential significance in learning constraints from demonstrations, with rigorous mathematical formalization.
- The authors provide strong empirical evidence demonstrating that their method outperforms Chou et al.'s approach across multiple performance criteria.
- The visual representations in Figures 1 and 2 are clear, and the algorithms are well-organized, aiding comprehension.

Weaknesses:
- The practical algorithm section appears rushed, with simplistic single-task results and insufficient discussion on multi-task maze examples.
- The paper does not adequately address computation costs, data requirements, or the implications of using expert demonstrations, particularly in real-world applications.
- There is a lack of comparison with prior work, particularly regarding the performance of the proposed method against established baselines, including a baseline comparison in simpler single-task setups.
- The paper does not directly address partially observed problems, which could limit its applicability in certain scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the practical algorithm section to provide a more comprehensive analysis of the multi-task maze example and clarify the threshold for correct constraint recovery. Additionally, we suggest reworking Figure 5 for better clarity and ensuring that all variables and acronyms are defined upon first use. It would also be beneficial to include comparisons with prior work, particularly Chou et al., to highlight the advantages of the proposed framework. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore more complex robotics tasks in their experiments to better validate the method's applicability in real-world scenarios. Lastly, we suggest adding a discussion of the differences between their work and that of Chou et al. in the body of the paper, at least in the Appendix, while summarizing key points in the main text.
