### Key Points
This paper presents an approach for N-to-N question answering pair extraction from customer service chatbot logs, proposing the DialogQAE model. The authors extend the existing 1-1 extraction methods to a more general N-N setting and introduce a suite of generative and discriminative tagging methods, evaluated on five datasets. The study sets up a benchmark for N-to-N DialogQAE with utterance and session-level evaluation metrics. The analysis of extracted QA pairs provides insights into dialogue structures, such as information seeking and clarification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured, clearly written, and easy to follow.
- It addresses a relevant problem in acquiring question-answering data for chatbots.
- The experiments are well-designed, and the results are thoroughly analyzed.
- The proposed models adapt to various domains and languages, reducing labor costs in real-world applications.

Weaknesses:
- The N-to-N question-answer pair extraction approach is relatively limited and lacks novelty in techniques.
- Experimental results show no significant improvement and lack comparisons with other methods.
- Some minor points require additional support or detail, and the paper is not very clear in certain areas.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper to enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with other methods to strengthen the experimental results. Providing more detailed descriptions of the parameter settings and ensuring the reproducibility of results would also be beneficial. Finally, addressing the limitations of the N-to-N approach could enhance the paper's contribution to the field.
