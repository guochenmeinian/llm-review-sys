### Key Points
This paper presents a study on online optimization involving upper linearizable/quadratizable functions, a new class of objectives that extends concavity and DR-submodularity across various settings. The authors propose a general meta-algorithm that transforms linear/quadratic maximization algorithms to optimize these upper quadratizable functions, thereby providing a unified approach to solving concave and DR-submodular optimization problems. The framework is applicable to a range of optimization scenarios, including online up-concave maximization with both monotone and non-monotone functions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of upper linearizable functions unifies and enhances results in various optimization settings by connecting them with linear optimization.
- The results are often achieved under fewer assumptions compared to previous works, such as requiring only up-concavity, differentiability, and Lipschitz continuity, while prior studies demanded more stringent conditions.
- The general framework improves understanding of the relationships among different optimization problems and facilitates the conversion of online results to offline contexts.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical nature of the paper lacks practical motivation for the proposed model, which could benefit from real-world applications.
- The absence of numerical results or empirical intuitions limits the practical insight into the theoretical guarantees provided.
- A discussion on lower bounds or their provision would strengthen the work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by providing motivations for the upper linearizable/quadratizable functions from practical applications. Additionally, including numerical results or empirical intuitions would enhance the understanding of the theoretical guarantees. Finally, discussing lower bounds or providing them would further strengthen the contributions of the paper.
