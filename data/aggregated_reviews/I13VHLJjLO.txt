### Key Points
This paper presents a method for Reward-Augmented Decoding (RAD) that utilizes a small unidirectional reward model to guide a language model in generating text with specific properties. The authors propose that this approach enables efficient decoding through caching intermediate activations. Experimental results on detoxification and sentiment-controlled generation tasks indicate that the proposed method outperforms other weighted decoding techniques and achieves results comparable to re-training methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed method is intuitive, sound, and easy to implement without excessive computational costs.  
- It demonstrates superior performance and decoding speed compared to other methods, supported by reliable experimental results.  
- The simplicity and effectiveness of the method could influence future research in controlled text generation.  

Weaknesses:  
- The description of the method lacks clarity, particularly regarding the term $\hat{r}$ in Section 2.2, which is not well-explained.  
- The contribution of the paper is perceived as thin, primarily combining known re-ranking techniques with reward models without providing significant technical insights.  
- There is insufficient discussion on why the proposed method achieves better performance compared to other weighted decoding methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method's description, especially regarding the term $\hat{r}$ in Section 2.2. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more thorough discussion on the reasons behind the superior performance of their method compared to other weighted decoding techniques. This could enhance the perceived contribution of the paper and provide deeper insights into its effectiveness.
