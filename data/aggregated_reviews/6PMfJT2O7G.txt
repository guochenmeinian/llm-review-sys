### Key Points
This paper presents a study on first-order methods for equilibrium computation in extensive form games (EFGs), focusing on the impact of the regularization choice, specifically distance-generating functions (DGFs). The authors propose that the weight-one dilated entropy (DilEnt) regularizer is optimal regarding the ratio of diameter to strong convexity, achieving an $\mathcal{O}(\log |V|)$ ratio. The paper also explores the combination of Online Mirror Descent with DGFs, leading to improved convergence rates for computing Coarse Correlated Equilibrium (CCE) in EFGs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The characterization of the DGF achieving the optimal diameter/strong-convexity ratio is a significant contribution to the game theory community.  
- The introduction of primal-dual treeplex norms enhances the analytical framework for first-order methods in EFGs.  
- The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the DilEnt regularizer's performance, establishing new state-of-the-art approximation rates for CCE.

Weaknesses:  
- The main takeaway regarding the necessity of the DGF approach compared to existing methods could be clearer, particularly in relation to the lower bound results.  
- There is a lack of empirical validation across diverse game settings, which is essential for understanding practical implications.  
- The focus on EFGs with perfect recall limits the applicability of the findings to scenarios with imperfect recall or partial information.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the main takeaway regarding the necessity of the DGF approach, particularly in relation to the lower bound results. Additionally, providing empirical validations of the proposed methods across real-world datasets would enhance the practical relevance of the findings. Finally, addressing scenarios with imperfect recall or partial information would broaden the applicability of the research.
