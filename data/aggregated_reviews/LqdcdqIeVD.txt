Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Spherical Frustum Sparse Convolution Network (SFCNet), designed for semantic segmentation of LiDAR point clouds. It addresses the quantized information loss inherent in traditional 2D projection methods by utilizing a spherical frustum structure that retains all points within a pixel. The network employs a hash-based representation and Frustum Farthest Point Sampling (F2PS) to enhance segmentation accuracy, particularly for small objects. Experimental results on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets indicate that SFCNet outperforms conventional methods, although it still lags behind state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D voxel-based approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. **Direct 3D Processing**: SFCNet processes LiDAR data directly in 3D, preserving spatial and geometric information.
2. **Reduced Quantization Loss**: The network significantly minimizes quantization loss compared to 2D projection methods, leading to improved segmentation accuracy.
3. **Efficient Sparse Convolution**: The use of sparse convolution is tailored for point clouds, allowing efficient computation and reduced memory usage.
4. **Spherical Frustum Structure**: This structure captures contextual information from various orientations and distances, enhancing object identification.
5. **Memory Efficiency**: The hash-based representation ensures efficient storage of spherical frustums.
6. **Improved Sampling Method**: F2PS enhances uniform sampling and computational efficiency.

Weaknesses:
1. **Lack of Conceptual Novelty**: The spherical structure has been partially explored in SphereFormer, limiting the novelty of SFCNet.
2. **Performance Gap**: SFCNet's performance for semantic segmentation is significantly below that of SphereFormer and SOTA 3D voxel-based methods.
3. **Complexity in Implementation**: The proposed methods may introduce challenges in practical implementation due to added complexity.
4. **Lack of Computational Efficiency Analysis**: The paper does not analyze the computational efficiency of SFCNet, which is crucial for understanding its practical significance.
5. **Sensitivity Analysis Missing**: There is no sensitivity analysis of key parameters, which would be valuable for tuning the model.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation by resizing Figure 1, removing captions from Figures 2 and 3, and increasing the internal spacing of Table 1. Additionally, we suggest providing a detailed comparison of SFCNet's performance against state-of-the-art methods such as DRQNet and JoSS, as well as a computational efficiency analysis. Addressing the performance gap with 3D voxel-based methods through optimization discussions would enhance the paper's contribution. Finally, including insights into the model's performance on wide-range classes and its robustness to noise and outliers would provide a clearer picture of its real-world applicability.
