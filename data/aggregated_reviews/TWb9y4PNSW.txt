### Key Points
This paper presents a novel application of conformal prediction (CP) within the Learning-to-Defer (L2D) framework, enabling the rejector to output a set of possible outcomes instead of a binary decision. This approach enhances the safety and robustness of L2D systems by allowing the rejector to express uncertainty. Additionally, the authors propose a new non-stationary kernel, the Beta Unit Hyper-Cube (BUC) kernel, for Bayesian Optimization on bounded domains, providing theoretical bounds for information gain and cumulative regret, and demonstrating its superior performance compared to Mat√©rn and RBF kernels in optimizing black-box functions and model compression tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The integration of CP with the L2D framework is unique and promising, allowing for robust decision-making under uncertainty.
2. The problem setting is relevant to real-world scenarios, showcasing CP's application in enhancing human-AI collaboration.
3. The introduction of the BUC kernel is novel, with a strong theoretical foundation and proven performance in model compression tasks.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a detailed discussion on various non-conformity scores, such as APS and RAPS, which could enhance its depth.
2. The integration of CP into the L2D framework may introduce computational complexity that is not adequately addressed.
3. The theoretical analysis of the BUC kernel is dense and may be challenging for non-experts, and the application scope is limited primarily to model compression.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on different kinds of non-conformity scores, specifically APS and RAPS, to provide a more comprehensive understanding. Additionally, addressing the potential computational complexity introduced by integrating CP into the L2D framework, particularly in real-time scenarios, would strengthen the paper. For the BUC kernel, we suggest expanding the range of applications beyond model compression to demonstrate its general applicability, and clarifying practical guidelines for selecting the bandwidth parameter h, including its sensitivity and performance implications. Lastly, providing insights into the computational complexity of the BUC kernel compared to traditional kernels in large-scale optimization tasks would enhance the paper's impact.
