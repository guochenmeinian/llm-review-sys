### Key Points
This paper presents a study on online learning within the context of learning-augmented algorithms, specifically focusing on the use of "best-action queries" to enhance the learning process. The authors investigate two settings: the full feedback model, where the learner observes the entire loss vector after each action, and the label-efficient feedback model, where feedback is only provided upon issuing a query. The results indicate that incorporating a limited number of best-action queries can significantly reduce regret, achieving bounds of \(O(\min(\sqrt{T}, T/k))\) for full feedback and \(O(\min(T/\sqrt{k}, T^2/k^2))\) for label-efficient feedback. The authors also provide matching lower bounds for these results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a relevant intersection of learning-augmented algorithms and online learning, contributing valuable insights to the literature.  
- The results demonstrate a surprising multiplicative effect of best-action queries on regret, which is a significant finding.  
- The model of sublinear best-action queries is well-motivated and theoretically interesting, with practical implications illustrated through examples.

Weaknesses:  
- The presentation is somewhat rushed and assumes a high level of background knowledge, making it challenging for readers less familiar with the field to follow the technical proofs.  
- The paper lacks sufficient intuition and high-level descriptions of the proof strategies, which could hinder understanding of the results.  
- The strong assumptions regarding the accuracy of best-action queries may limit the practical applicability of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation by providing more intuitive explanations and high-level overviews of the proof strategies to guide readers through the technical content. Additionally, consider discussing the implications of using noisy or approximate best-action queries, as this could broaden the relevance of the findings. It would also be beneficial to include a more detailed discussion of related work within the main paper to provide context for the investigation. Lastly, addressing the limitations of the model assumptions and exploring scenarios beyond moderation where best-action queries may apply would enhance the paper's depth.
