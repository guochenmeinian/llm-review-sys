### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to assist operators of tokamaks, crucial devices in nuclear fusion research, by introducing a retrieval augmented generation system that utilizes text logs from experiments. The authors propose a method to obtain helpful text responses from various LLMs by augmenting them with these logs, potentially extending its utility beyond tokamak operations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The problem addressed is very novel.  
- The focus on practical applications for tokamak operators tackles real-world challenges.  
- The authors enhance reproducibility by providing transparency regarding datasets and methodology.

Weaknesses:  
- There is no quantitative evaluation of the proposed framework; only qualitative evaluations and examples are presented.  
- The human evaluation is limited to a few cases, rendering the results less convincing.  
- The analysis of results lacks detail, with insufficient comparison of different methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including quantitative evaluations and numerical results to demonstrate the framework's effectiveness. Additionally, a more comprehensive human evaluation and a detailed comparison of various methods would strengthen the findings.
