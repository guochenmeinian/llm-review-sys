### Key Points
This paper presents a novel similarity matrix calibration method aimed at addressing incomplete observations in similarity search problems. The authors propose a parallel matrix calibration method that estimates the similarity matrix to approximate the fully observed ground-truth similarity matrix, discovering its factored form to enable fast optimization. The paper introduces two algorithms: Basic Similarity Vector Calibration (BSVC) and Conjugate Gradient and Quasi-Newton-based Approximated BSVC (CQABSVC), both of which demonstrate superior performance in extensive experiments on real-world datasets. However, the implementation of the algorithms in MATLAB is not provided.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper presents a high-quality, original method that utilizes the positive semi-definiteness (PSD) property for estimating similarity matrices, which has not been reported in existing literature.
- The clarity of the writing and the detailed pseudo code enhance the understanding and implementation of the proposed algorithms.
- The significance of the method is underscored by its broad application prospects in real-world scenarios involving incomplete observations.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental results indicate that the method does not achieve optimal results in all cases, particularly in specific situations.
- The limited diversity of datasets used in experiments, with only one text dataset included, does not fully demonstrate the method's effectiveness across different fields and higher-dimensional datasets.
- Some results and analyses, particularly in Table 2 and Section 6.5, are confusing or incorrect, leading to potential misinterpretations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Table 2 by explaining the counterintuitive results regarding time costs for different dataset sizes. Additionally, the authors should address the inaccuracies in the conclusions drawn in Section 6.5 and consider merging figures for clearer analysis. To enhance the paper's applicability, we suggest providing more information on extending the methods to other similarity measures and including specific implementation details and performance evaluations in various application scenarios. Finally, we encourage the authors to include experimental results on a broader range of datasets to strengthen the paper's persuasiveness.
