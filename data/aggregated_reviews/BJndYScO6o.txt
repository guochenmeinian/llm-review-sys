Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Model-Based Diffusion (MBD), a novel method for solving trajectory optimization (TO) problems by leveraging diffusion processes. MBD formulates the optimization as a sampling problem, directly computing the score function using model information. The authors demonstrate that MBD outperforms state-of-the-art TO methods in various tasks, including locomotion and manipulation, while also showing connections to sampling-based optimization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for using model information in trajectory optimization is valid and well-articulated.
- The problem statement is clear, making it accessible to readers unfamiliar with the topic.
- Experimental results indicate that MBD outperforms existing methods across multiple domains.

Weaknesses:
- The introduction claims that existing diffusion-based approaches require high-quality demonstration data, but lacks empirical evidence supporting this assertion. The absence of diffusion-based planners in the baselines raises questions about their exclusion.
- The authors assert that model-based diffusion has superior generalization capabilities compared to model-free diffusion, yet empirical validation for this claim is missing.
- The theoretical derivation and notation in the methodology are confusing and difficult to follow.
- Comparisons to simple RL baselines like PPO do not convincingly demonstrate MBD's advantages.
- There are potential inaccuracies in the equations presented, which could mislead readers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical validation of claims regarding the necessity of high-quality demonstration data and the generalization capabilities of model-based diffusion. Specifically, the authors should include model-free diffusion planners in the baselines to substantiate their claims. Additionally, clarifying the theoretical derivation and simplifying the notation would enhance understanding. The authors should also ensure that comparisons with RL algorithms are fair by discussing the differences in reward computation methods. Lastly, addressing the potential inaccuracies in the equations and providing clearer explanations of the methodology will strengthen the paper.
