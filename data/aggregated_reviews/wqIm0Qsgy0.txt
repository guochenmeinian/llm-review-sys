Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel unsupervised learning approach utilizing Granger Causality to identify driving and driven components in multivariate time series. The authors propose a method that extracts pairs of latent components from EEG and fMRI data, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach through simulations and empirical results. The method employs a block coordinate descent algorithm to optimize spatial projections based on Granger causality, providing insights into information flow between brain areas.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper proposes an elegant and potentially useful method for identifying causal structures, supported by convincing experimental results across different neuroimaging modalities.  
- The writing is clear and the derivation of the method is easy to follow, contributing to the overall quality of the paper.  

Weaknesses:  
- The number of latent variables is pre-defined without an adaptive mechanism, limiting the flexibility of the approach.  
- The literature cited is outdated, lacking performance comparisons with similar causal inference algorithms, and the assumptions regarding the nature of relationships (linear or non-linear) are not explicitly stated.  
- Simulations are limited to a specific model, making it difficult to assess the generalizability of the proposed algorithm.  
- The method does not adequately address the identifiability of the model, and the potential for spurious Granger causality due to mixing of independent sources is not sufficiently discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the adaptive mechanism for determining the number of latent variables to enhance the flexibility of the model. Additionally, the authors should update the literature review to include recent advancements in causal inference and provide performance comparisons against standard methods like conditional Granger causality. It is crucial to explicitly state the assumptions regarding the relationships between components and to explore a wider range of simulation scenarios to better assess the method's robustness. Furthermore, a theoretical discussion on model identifiability and the implications of mixing independent sources should be included. Lastly, we suggest incorporating a statistical approach for assessing the significance of interactions among extracted sources to mitigate overfitting concerns.
