Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Species196 dataset, which includes two components: Species196-L, comprising 19,236 expert-annotated images of 196 invasive species, and Species196-U, containing approximately 1.5 million unlabeled images sourced from LAION-5B using the clip-retrieval method. The dataset aims to address challenges such as class similarity, low variability, and data imbalance, which are critical for the accurate identification of invasive organisms. The authors provide a detailed breakdown of the dataset's provenance, noting that only 39.54% of images come from the top twenty sources, reflecting a broad range of origins. They also discuss the semi-supervised learning approach and the importance of performance metrics, particularly in the context of class imbalance, while presenting updated benchmark results, including micro accuracy and Macro F1 scores.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is generally easy to read and follow.
2. The dataset's diversity and broad sourcing enhance its applicability for real-world scenarios.
3. Bounding boxes for insect pests are labeled according to the COCO format, enabling spatial information for accurate pest location and categorization.
4. A hierarchical taxonomy system from domain to species level provides detailed classification information, valuable for researchers in invasive species management.
5. The Species196-L dataset includes images of invasive species at various life stages, facilitating the study of their ecological and economic impacts.
6. The authors acknowledge the challenges of data imbalance and propose the use of Macro F1 scores to better evaluate model performance.
7. The paper includes detailed benchmark results and clarifications on dataset metrics and annotations.

Weaknesses:
1. Baseline experimental results are limited to basic models, lacking extensive experiments on fine-grained techniques necessary for advancing this work.
2. The paper does not include comparative experiments with semi-supervised and related methods, particularly regarding the effectiveness of the Species196-U dataset in a fair experimental setting.
3. The absence of a validation split in the dataset could lead to overfitting concerns.
4. The semi-supervised learning setup is not clearly defined, making comparisons with supervised approaches difficult.
5. Grammatical issues and clarity in the presentation of certain concepts detract from the overall quality of the manuscript.
6. The paper lacks detailed geographic information on species distribution, which could limit its utility for practitioners in different regions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the methodological rigor by including extensive experiments on fine-grained techniques to enhance the dataset's applicability. Additionally, we suggest incorporating comparative experiments with semi-supervised methods to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Species196-U dataset. Clarifying the dataset's limitations, particularly regarding data imbalance and the implications for performance metrics, would also strengthen the paper. Furthermore, providing more details on the provenance of the images and ensuring a permanent download link for the datasets would enhance usability for the research community. We also recommend improving the clarity of the semi-supervised learning setup by using the same backbone as in the supervised experiments to facilitate fair comparisons. Providing geographic distribution data for the species in the dataset would enhance its relevance for global practitioners. We encourage the authors to refine the writing and documentation of the Species196 dataset webpage to better serve the research community and address grammatical issues throughout the manuscript to improve readability. Finally, consider renaming section 4.2.2 to "Self-supervised Pretraining" to better reflect its content and introduce masked image modeling earlier in the paper for improved flow.
