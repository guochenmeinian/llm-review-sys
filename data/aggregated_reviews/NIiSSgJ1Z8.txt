### Key Points
This paper investigates the relationship between uncertainty quantification (UQ) and factuality in large language models (LLMs), introducing the "shared circuits" hypothesis. The authors propose that the same model circuits responsible for answering factual questions also express uncertainty. They utilize mechanistic interpretability techniques, such as path patching and zero-ablation, to analyze eight different models across five datasets, revealing that uncertainty and factuality are processed by overlapping components.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and succinct, making a clear contribution to understanding the relationship between uncertainty estimation paths and QA paths.
- The hypothesis, methods, and results are well-defined and connected, with a rigorous statistical approach that strengthens the scientific merit.
- Innovative use of mechanistic interpretability techniques provides deeper insights into model behavior.

Weaknesses:
- The explanation of the method and experiments lacks clarity, particularly regarding path-patching and zero-ablation.
- The experiments focus primarily on factual recall tasks, limiting the generalizability of the shared circuits hypothesis to other tasks.
- The paper requires access to the final activation layer of the LLM, which is not available in widely used models like ChatGPT.
- Some sections, especially on path patching, could benefit from additional explanations for readers unfamiliar with advanced interpretability techniques.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology and experiment descriptions, particularly regarding path-patching and zero-ablation. Additionally, extending the experiments to include more models and datasets would strengthen the results and enhance generalizability. We suggest moving some methodological content from the Appendix to the main body for better accessibility. Furthermore, exploring alternative ablation techniques and more lightweight methods of probing model uncertainty could improve the practical applicability of the findings.
