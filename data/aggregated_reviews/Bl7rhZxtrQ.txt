### Key Points
This paper presents POLISH, an adaptive online cross-modal hashing method that addresses incremental label spaces without assuming a constant label set. The authors propose a loss function to learn class label embeddings, emphasizing the preservation of label correlation relationships. Experimental results indicate that POLISH outperforms baseline methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The topic is engaging and relevant, particularly for real-world applications in cross-modal retrieval.
- The paper is well-organized and clearly written, facilitating comprehension of the proposed method.
- POLISH effectively incorporates language models to enhance label embeddings, demonstrating innovative use of semantic information.

Weaknesses:
- The notation used in the paper requires clarification, particularly the use of ~ and -> superscripts for matrix distinctions, and there are excessive inline formulas.
- The motivation and problem formulation lack clarity, particularly regarding input and output specifications.
- The experimental setup is insufficiently detailed, and the paper does not address potential challenges with large numbers of new classes during training or the impact of data volume on results.
- The writing contains multiple typos and colloquial expressions, detracting from the technical precision.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the notation and reduce the number of inline formulas. Additionally, providing a more detailed explanation of the experimental setup and addressing the questions regarding the method's performance with large new class increments and data volume would strengthen the paper. We suggest clarifying the motivation and problem formulation, particularly the input and output of the model. Furthermore, enhancing the writing quality by correcting typos and avoiding colloquial expressions is essential. Finally, a more extensive comparative analysis against state-of-the-art methods, particularly those addressing incremental label spaces, would highlight POLISH's unique advantages.
