### Key Points
This paper presents a mathematical framework for class-incremental learning (class-IL) that includes the Infeasibility Theorem, demonstrating that optimal class-IL is unattainable with discriminative modeling. In contrast, the Feasibility Theorem indicates that optimal class-IL can be achieved through generative modeling, provided that task confusion (TC) is prevented. The authors empirically evaluate their theorems against traditional class-IL strategies, such as regularization, bias-correction, replay, and generative classifiers.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The writing is clear, making the paper easy to understand.  
- The motivation for the theoretical framework is strong and significant.  
- The proposed framework is insightful and well-structured, with a notable theoretical contribution that can guide future method design.  

Weaknesses:  
- Theorems, experimental results, and contributions need clarification in the introduction, and method comparisons should be detailed in the related works section.  
- More details on discriminative/generative modeling and related continual learning strategies are necessary for clarity, especially for new readers.  
- The proofs in the appendices are informal and lack sufficient equations, with some figures missing and grammatical issues present in theorems.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their theorems and experimental results in the introduction section. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed comparison of methods in the related works section. It is essential to elaborate on the concepts of discriminative and generative modeling to aid understanding for readers unfamiliar with these topics. The authors should formalize the proofs in the appendices and ensure that all figures and equations are correctly presented and complete. Lastly, addressing the grammatical issues in theorems will enhance the overall readability and comprehension of the paper.
