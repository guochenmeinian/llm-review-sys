### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for representation learning on text-attributed graphs (TAGs) by integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) through a unified learning framework. The authors propose five self-supervised contrastive optimization objectives, including a high-frequency aware (HFC) loss, to enhance the learning process. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on six datasets for link prediction and node classification tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel unsupervised contrastive learning approach for joint training of GNNs and LMs.
- State-of-the-art performance is shown on six common datasets for both link prediction and node classification tasks.
- The writing is generally clear and well-structured.

Weaknesses:
- There is a lack of information regarding the hyper-parameter optimization process and the specific values chosen.
- Some claims are made without sufficient backing or context, such as the assertion that "these methods typically employ supervised training."
- The motivation for using contrastive learning and the connection between HFC and the proposed objectives are not clearly articulated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the hyper-parameter optimization process by providing specific values used in the experiments and conducting a sensitivity analysis. Additionally, we suggest that the authors justify the design choices for the contrastive learning objectives, particularly the use of node-wise PPR for selecting important neighbors and the rationale behind forming positive training pairs. Furthermore, addressing the scalability of the proposed method and its performance on node classification tasks would enhance the paper's impact.
