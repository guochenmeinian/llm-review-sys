### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to hallucination mitigation in large language models through an unsupervised fine-tuning technique that leverages semantic entropy to assess model uncertainty. The authors introduce the **Accuracy Engagement Distance (AED)**, a new evaluation metric that quantifies the model's confidence in generating correct answers, particularly in long-context scenarios. The method demonstrates significant improvements in hallucination reduction and answer accuracy across various datasets, including TriviaQA, BioASQ, NQ, and SQuAD.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Addresses a critical challenge in the safety tuning of large language models, focusing on hallucination mitigation without requiring labeled data.
- Introduces the novel concept of **Accuracy Engagement Distance (AED)**, providing valuable insights into LLM performance assessment.
- Conducts thorough experiments demonstrating up to 30.1% reduction in hallucination rates for long-form generations.

Weaknesses:
- AED is not compared to other state-of-the-art hallucination detection metrics like EigenScore, lacking experimental support for its claimed holistic capability.
- The concept of willingness in relation to hallucinations is discussed but lacks clarity on its definition and implications.
- The fine-tuning protocol shows limited benefits for short-QA tasks, suggesting inefficiencies in resource use for simpler tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison of AED with other hallucination detection metrics, such as EigenScore, to substantiate its advantages. Additionally, clarifying the definition of willingness and its implications in the context of hallucinations would enhance the paper's depth. To address the performance on short-QA tasks, we suggest exploring alternative fine-tuning strategies or dataset expansions, such as increasing the dataset size by five times, to potentially strengthen the results.
