Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to simultaneously detecting a person's gaze location and recognizing the class label of the gaze target. The authors propose a new architecture that efficiently processes scene images to decode correlations between head information and scene tokens, particularly effective in scenarios with multiple individuals. They evaluate their method using the GazeFollow dataset and introduce GazeHOI, demonstrating superior performance in gaze target localization compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a meaningful task by simultaneously detecting gaze target location and semantic labels, which has been rarely explored.
2. The authors create a benchmark dataset that includes both gaze target location and semantic labels.
3. The gaze decoder component is innovative, allowing for efficient processing without the computational burden of previous methods.
4. The proposed method outperforms existing techniques in localizing gaze targets.

Weaknesses:
1. The proposed method does not show significant advantages in recognizing gaze target labels compared to baselines, which also perform well in localization.
2. The introduction of L_lab is unnecessary, as it does not enhance gaze target localization and could be simplified.
3. The details of the gaze decoder are unclear, particularly regarding the intermediate variables x_gaze and x_img in the figures.
4. The improvements over existing methods are limited, and the necessity of detecting object classes is not convincingly justified.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the gaze decoder section by explicitly marking intermediate variables in the figures. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more detailed discussion on the benefits of simultaneous semantic label prediction and its impact on localization accuracy. It would be beneficial to include experimental evidence supporting the claimed computational efficiency. Furthermore, consider exploring additional data augmentation techniques to enhance the robustness of the pipeline and address performance issues in specific scene angles by incorporating depth information. Lastly, please ensure that all references are correctly formatted and clarify the plans for publicly releasing the datasets and models.
