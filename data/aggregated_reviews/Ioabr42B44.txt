Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach called the Dense Connector (DC), a plug-and-play vision-language connector that enhances existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by leveraging multi-layer visual features from a frozen visual encoder. The authors propose three instantiations of the Dense Connector: Sparse Token Integration (STI), Sparse Channel Integration (SCI), and Dense Channel Integration (DCI). The versatility and scalability of their approach are demonstrated across various visual encoders, image resolutions, training dataset scales, LLM sizes, and MLLM architectures, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 19 image and video benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The Dense Connector is easily integrated into mainstream MLLM architectures, enhancing visual representation with minimal additional computation.
2. The authors demonstrate the compatibility and scalability of the proposed approach across diverse visual encoders and tasks, including video understanding.

Weaknesses:
1. The authors conduct experiments on several MLLM models but do not summarize the compatible scope of model architectures.
2. Previous works have explored enhancing visual representations from multi-level features, and the authors should provide fair comparisons with these studies.
3. The performance gain appears limited, particularly on high-resolution MLLM baselines, and the scalability of DC may be constrained.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by summarizing the compatible types of MLLM architectures for the Dense Connector. Additionally, we encourage the authors to provide comparisons with previous works, particularly those utilizing CLIP vision encoders. To enhance the assessment of DC's effectiveness, we suggest extending comparisons using a Vicuna-13B model based on the MGM framework and incorporating additional benchmark datasets such as VQAv2, MME, and POPE. Furthermore, the authors should explore dynamic high-resolution scenarios and consider updating the LLM to evaluate the Dense Connector's performance more comprehensively. Lastly, including a line chart with a broader range of combinations would facilitate clearer visual comparisons.
