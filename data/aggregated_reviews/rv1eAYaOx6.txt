### Key Points
This paper presents a large-scale measurement study on Ethereum upgradeable smart contracts (USCs) and their security implications. The authors propose USCDetector, a tool designed to identify USCs by analyzing bytecode and transaction data. The study categorizes USCs into five types and uncovers various security issues, including missing restrictive checks and contract version problems. The findings are significant for understanding the vulnerabilities associated with USCs in real-world applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper conducts a comprehensive measurement study, revealing multiple real-world USCs with potential security issues.
- The writing is clear and well-articulated, making complex topics accessible.
- The tool USCDetector effectively identifies USCs based on readily available information.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a comparison with state-of-the-art work, particularly Proxy Hunting, which limits the evaluation of its contributions.
- The significance of the identified security issues is unclear, including the popularity of affected contracts and whether developers were notified.
- The methodology is insufficiently detailed, particularly regarding the detection of upgradeable contracts and the evaluation of false negatives.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by conducting a comparative analysis with Proxy Hunting to highlight the unique contributions of USCDetector. Additionally, clarifying the significance of the discovered security issues, including statistics on affected transactions and contract popularity, would enhance the paper's impact. We suggest that the authors report their findings to the developers of the contracts to obtain feedback and assess the fixability of the identified issues. Furthermore, an evaluation of false negatives should be included to strengthen the methodology. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide more detailed descriptions of their methods and insights derived from the results to improve clarity and replicability.
