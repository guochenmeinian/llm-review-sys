### Key Points
This paper presents a multi-stage poison dataset detpxification pipeline that introduces a novel poison extraction technique, separating poison triggers from clean images using actual poison samples. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method surpasses baseline methods in certain scenarios, supported by several ablation studies and an adaptive attack detailed in the Appendix.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed poison extraction technique is innovative and effectively separates poison triggers from clean images.  
- The experimental results demonstrate superiority over baseline methods in some cases, bolstered by comprehensive ablation studies.  

Weaknesses:  
- The assumptions required for the defense are overly stringent, necessitating access to actual poisoned samples, clean samples, and the poisoned training set, which limits practicality and fairness in comparisons with other methods.  
- The methodology lacks clarity, particularly regarding the principles behind certain equations and the rationale for specific choices, such as using logit values instead of representation-level information.  
- The complexity of the method, including numerous hyperparameters and a lack of interpretability, raises concerns about its practical application.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the underlying principles of their methodology, particularly regarding the intuition behind "enforcing style similarity" in Eq (7) and the implications of using $\tilde p$ alongside the recovered poison trigger pattern $p$. Additionally, consider addressing the potential for all-to-all attacks and the effectiveness of $D^3$ in mitigating them. We suggest that the authors explore the possibility of assigning larger weights to the gradients of the few poisoned samples during training, which could strengthen their argument. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to compare the proposed method with white-box backdoor scanners and more advanced poison cleansers. Lastly, we encourage the authors to simplify the method pipeline and provide a more thorough study of hyperparameters, particularly the choice of $\gamma$, to enhance interpretability and practicality.
