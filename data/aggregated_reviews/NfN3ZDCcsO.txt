### Key Points
This paper presents a study on unsupervised keyphrase extraction, introducing the SAMRank algorithm that leverages attention matrices from pre-trained models like BERT and GPT to assess token importance. The experimental section demonstrates that SAMRank outperforms traditional embedding-based methods, validating its efficacy through comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets. The authors propose a novel approach that distinguishes itself from existing methods by utilizing self-attention maps to quantify candidate keyword significance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method shows promising results on three representative keyphrase extraction datasets.
- The motivation for using self-attention maps is well-articulated, making the paper easy to follow.
- The experimental results validate the effectiveness of SAMRank, demonstrating its superiority over embedding-based models.

Weaknesses:
- There is insufficient exploration regarding the selection of appropriate layers and heads of attention matrices.
- The technological novelty is somewhat limited, as some existing methods have already integrated transformer models with traditional unsupervised techniques.
- The evaluation lacks comparisons with the latest neural keyphrase generation models and additional datasets, such as KP20k and Krapivin.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the exploration of how to select appropriate layers and heads of attention matrices in their method. Additionally, consider investigating the differences in attention mechanisms between large-scale language models and smaller counterparts. It would also be beneficial to include comparisons with recent neural keyphrase generation models and to evaluate the proposed model on more datasets, such as KP20k and Krapivin. Furthermore, please provide detailed explanations regarding the performance limitations of the method and clarify the phrase boundaries in Section 3.5.
