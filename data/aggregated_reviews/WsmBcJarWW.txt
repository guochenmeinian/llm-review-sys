Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method that combines weighted AUC (WAUC) learning with cost-sensitive learning through a bi-level optimization framework. The authors aim to address class and cost distribution shifts without relying on prior information about these distributions. The proposed algorithm demonstrates high performance in cost-sensitive scenarios, supported by extensive experiments across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized, clearly outlining its goals and challenges.
- The proposed WAUC is robust against both class and cost distribution shifts, outperforming traditional AUC metrics.
- The theoretical analysis includes convergence rates for the WAUC estimation and the bi-level optimization.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation is marred by unclear notation and several typographical errors, particularly in Proposition 5.1 and related proofs.
- The complexity analysis of the proposed optimization method is insufficient.
- The method's performance does not demonstrate significant improvements over existing metrics in certain scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by reorganizing mathematical formulas and ensuring that definitions precede their usage. Additionally, addressing the unclear aspects of Proposition 5.1 and providing a detailed complexity analysis would enhance the paper's rigor. It would also be beneficial to include error bars in the experimental results and repeat experiments to report mean and standard deviation values. Finally, discussing the implications of varying costs in real-world applications would strengthen the practical relevance of the work.
