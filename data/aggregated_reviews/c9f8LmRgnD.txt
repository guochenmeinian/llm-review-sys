### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach, **Adversarial Style Augmentation (AdStyle)**, aimed at enhancing the robustness of fake news detectors against style-conversion attacks facilitated by large language models (LLMs). The authors propose generating adversarial style prompts tailored to the specific detector, thereby training it to recognize and withstand various textual style perturbations. The methodology involves evaluating a pool of style-conversion prompts to identify those that most effectively confuse the detector, ultimately leading to improved detection capabilities across multiple datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The topic is timely and significant, addressing the growing challenge of fake news detection.
- The paper is well-structured, clearly articulating the problem and contributions.
- The approach demonstrates superior performance over existing baselines across various datasets and attack scenarios, indicating its effectiveness and generalizability.
- The use of automated prompt engineering to generate adversarial prompts is innovative and enhances the augmentation process.

Weaknesses:
- The architecture and specific tasks of the detector are not clearly defined, raising questions about its binary classification capabilities.
- High false positive rates are concerning, as reliance solely on style for detecting fake news is risky; the paper does not adequately address how it ensures the accuracy of classifications.
- The methodology lacks clarity, with vague descriptions of prompt generation and selection criteria, making replication difficult.
- The evaluation metrics and their relevance, particularly the use of AUC, are not sufficiently justified.
- There is limited discussion on the real-world applicability of the results, particularly in noisy or manipulated data scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the detector's architecture and its classification tasks to provide a better understanding of its functionality. Additionally, addressing the high false positive rates by incorporating more robust validation methods would strengthen the paper. The authors should clarify the prompt generation process, including the criteria for selecting adversarial prompts and how these relate to the detector's performance. Furthermore, we suggest providing a more in-depth analysis of the generated prompts and their impact on the detector's learning process. Lastly, discussing the potential biases in LLMs and their implications for the generated prompts would enhance the ethical considerations of the work.
