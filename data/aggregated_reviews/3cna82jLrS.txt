### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for fake news detection using a heterogeneous subgraph transformer (HeteroSGT) that integrates textual features and structural information from a heterogeneous graph. The authors evaluate their model across five datasets, demonstrating improvements over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The approach includes detailed experiments, case studies, and an ablation study to assess model performance and limitations. Notably, the authors introduce random walk subgraph sampling to enhance positional encoding without additional computational costs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a timely issue in fake news detection and proposes a novel model that shows SOTA performance.
- Extensive experimentation, including ablation studies, supports the effectiveness of the proposed method.
- The model description is thorough, and a code repository enhances reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- The central premise regarding atypical graph structures lacks sufficient exploration, raising concerns about its applicability in various contexts, such as long-running propaganda campaigns.
- Key components, such as the use of LDA for topic determination, are outdated, and empirical testing of newer alternatives is recommended.
- The paper is considered incremental, primarily enhancing existing methods rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the exploration of the central premise by conducting an initial analysis and error analysis to demonstrate the model's robustness against misclassifying significant real news. Additionally, we suggest empirically testing newer topic modeling techniques, such as BERT or BERTopic, instead of LDA, and providing a clearer justification for the use of random walk-based methods in the methodology section. Finally, enhancing the baseline comparisons to include more SOTA methods, such as KAN and dEFEND, would strengthen the paper's contributions.
