Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Frequent Attribute Pattern Augmented Transformer (FAPAT), a transformer-based method that enhances session-based recommendation models by utilizing attribute patterns as supplementary information. FAPAT constructs attribute transition graphs, mines frequent attribute patterns, and matches these patterns to better capture user intents. Experiments on two public benchmarks and three industrial datasets demonstrate a noticeable performance improvement (averaging 4.5%) across all tests. The authors promise to release the code and datasets post-acceptance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction effectively outlines the problem and the high-level concept of the proposed method.
2. Table 1 in the Related Work section efficiently compares existing methods with the proposed approach.
3. The methodology section is clear and easy to follow.
4. The experiments are thorough, featuring a good number of baselines.

Weaknesses:
1. Some thought processes, such as the choice of gSpan and the selection of the twenty types of patterns in section 4.1.1, are not adequately explained.
2. The method is criticized for being overly complex, with limited performance improvements relative to simpler alternatives.
3. Important baselines, specifically SASRec and FDSA, are missing from the experiments, raising concerns about the comprehensiveness of the evaluation.
4. The motivations behind various model components are not clearly articulated, and the computational cost of the proposed method is not addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their thought processes, particularly regarding the choice of gSpan and the selection of patterns. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with the missing baselines SASRec and FDSA to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method. It would also be beneficial to conduct an efficiency analysis to address concerns about computational cost and latency, ensuring the method's applicability in real-time scenarios. Lastly, we encourage the authors to discuss more powerful sequence-based approaches and provide further insights into the design choices made in their methodology.
