Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents HyperRouter, a dynamic routing approach that generates router parameters through a fixed hypernetwork and trainable embeddings, addressing the tradeoff between fixed and trainable routers in Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) training. The authors claim that HyperRouter mitigates representation collapse and improves inference efficiency by achieving competitive performance with fewer experts. Empirical results demonstrate that HyperRouter outperforms existing methods in both pre-training and fine-tuning tasks across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- HyperRouter introduces a novel method that balances fixed and trainable routers, enhancing routing policies and alleviating representation collapse.
- The experimental results on a small-scale Transformer-XL show convincing performance improvements, particularly in pre-training tasks, where HyperRouter achieves similar performance with half the number of experts.
- Additional analyses, including inference FLOPs and routing visualization, strengthen the paper's claims.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments are limited to a single transformer architecture, raising questions about the generalizability of the results to larger and medium-scale models.
- There is insufficient analysis of communication overhead associated with varying numbers of experts, which obscures the understanding of performance gains.
- The rationale behind the decoupling of HyperRouter's embeddings from token representations lacks clarity and context.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the breadth of their experiments by evaluating HyperRouter on additional transformer architectures and larger models to provide a clearer picture of its performance in diverse settings. Additionally, we suggest including a comprehensive analysis of communication overhead to clarify how it impacts performance. Finally, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the reasoning behind the decoupling of embeddings from token representations to enhance reader understanding.
