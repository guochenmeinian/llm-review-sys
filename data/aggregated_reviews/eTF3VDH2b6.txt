Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Local Zeroth Order method for training spiking neural networks (SNNs), which fits arbitrary surrogate functions by sampling variables from a specific distribution. The authors demonstrate that their approach, which combines standard surrogate methods with zeroth-order estimation, outperforms existing methods on benchmark tasks, particularly in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy. The theoretical analysis provided is robust, and experiments validate the advantages of the proposed method, although primarily on small-scale datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The novel idea of fitting arbitrary surrogate functions through sampling is compelling.
2. The theoretical analysis regarding the zeroth-order function is profound and well-articulated.
3. Experimental results, especially on ResNet-19, highlight the method's advantages.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the method is limited, as it appears to be a combination of existing techniques.
2. The experiments are primarily conducted on small-scale datasets, raising concerns about scalability and generalization.
3. Marginal improvements in performance on larger datasets like ImageNet-100 suggest limited advancements over state-of-the-art methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental validation by including results on larger datasets, such as ImageNet-1K or additional DVS datasets, to better assess the scalability and generalization of the proposed method. Additionally, we suggest discussing the adaptivity of the zeroth-order method in more detail, particularly how the distribution for sampling can be selected during training. Furthermore, exploring the impact of varying the number of samples on both accuracy and computational efficiency could provide valuable insights into the trade-offs involved.
