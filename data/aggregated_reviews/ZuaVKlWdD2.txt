Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents BiDock, a novel framework for rigid protein docking that integrates sequence and structure information through bi-level optimization. The authors utilize an Evoformer-based model to predict a distance matrix and optimize the roto-translation using a gradient-based approach. BiDock is specifically trained for docking antibody chains and demonstrates improved performance across various protein complexes, particularly in challenging antibody-antigen interactions. The authors also propose an inference interface akin to AlphaFold2 due to challenges in releasing complete code. They address a misunderstanding regarding Eq. (12) and emphasize the model's access to ground truth during training, supported by theoretical derivations, comprehensive model presentation, and ablation study results. Despite concerns about the novelty and complexity of the approach, the authors believe their work offers valuable insights.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of multimodal protein representation enhances the accuracy of rigid protein docking predictions.
- The bi-level optimization formulation allows for joint optimization of docking poses and multimodal feature weights.
- Spectral initialization for gradient descent provides a meaningful improvement in performance.
- The introduction of two curated datasets from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) adds valuable resources for evaluating docking methods.
- Commitment to contributing to the AI4Science open-source community.
- Clear explanations addressing misunderstandings about the model's training process.
- Promising performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty claims regarding the use of sequence and structure information are overstated, as similar approaches exist in prior works.
- The loss function's dependence on the optimization variables is unclear, raising questions about the bi-level optimization's effectiveness.
- Several important related works are not discussed or compared, limiting the contextual understanding of BiDock's contributions.
- The paper lacks detailed information on the dataset curation process and the evaluation setup, which may affect reproducibility.
- The bi-level optimization approach is perceived as straightforward and lacking depth.
- Limited novelty in the proposed method, affecting its overall impact.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their novelty claims, particularly regarding the integration of sequence and structure information, by addressing existing methods. Additionally, we suggest providing a clearer explanation of the loss function's formulation and its relationship to the bi-level optimization process. The authors should also include a discussion of related works, such as DiffDock-PP and xTrimoDock, to enhance the contextual framework of their contributions. Furthermore, we recommend improving the depth of the bi-level optimization approach to address concerns about computational complexity. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the dataset curation process and provide more details on the evaluation setup to improve reproducibility and transparency.
