Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a spectral transformation (ST) framework aimed at addressing the dimensional collapse problem in self-supervised learning (SSL). The authors propose IterNorm with trace loss (INTL) as a method to modulate the spectrum of embeddings, enhancing performance on various SSL benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate that INTL achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks such as ImageNet classification and COCO object detection, while also being less sensitive to batch size.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper provides a theoretical foundation for the proposed spectral transformation, extending the commonly used whitening transformation to a more general form.
2. The experimental validation is robust, showing significant improvements over existing methods across multiple benchmarks.
3. The presentation is clear, effectively communicating the motivation and contributions of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
1. The comparison between the proposed method and baseline approaches is flawed due to the use of a larger projection head, which increases computational and memory costs, complicating fair evaluations.
2. The motivation for the IterNorm with trace loss is not clearly articulated, and the sensitivity of the method to batch size raises concerns about its practical applicability.
3. The paper lacks citations of relevant recent works that share similar methodologies, which diminishes the perceived novelty of the contribution.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind IterNorm with trace loss, explicitly stating the limitations of existing SSL methods. Additionally, we suggest including a fair comparison against baseline methods that utilize similar batch sizes and projection heads. It would also be beneficial to expand the experimental evaluation to include results from transformer architectures, given their prevalence in the field. Finally, we encourage the authors to cite relevant recent works that align with their approach to enhance the contextualization of their contributions.
