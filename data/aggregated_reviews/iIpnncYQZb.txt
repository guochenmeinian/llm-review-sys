### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Named Entity Recognition (NER) model designed to identify both formal and informal toponyms and spatial relationships in unstructured text from Airbnb listings. The authors develop a taxonomy of 21 toponymic categories and manually annotate 2,600 listings. They compare three fine-tuned transformer models, with the Conditional Random Field (CRF) model achieving the best F1 score. The model is applied to analyze the NYC Airbnb dataset concerning a gentrification index, revealing that the frequency of neighborhood name mentions correlates positively with gentrification, while references to other entities show an inverse correlation. The work highlights the sociological implications of gentrification, employing modern NLP techniques to enhance toponymic NER.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a relevant sociological topic, exploring gentrification in NYC through innovative NLP methods.
- It demonstrates a successful interdisciplinary approach, merging computational social science with linguistic analysis.
- The manual data collection and annotation process is thorough, and the paper is well-written and clear.

Weaknesses:
- The method's generalizability is limited as it is tested solely on New York City.
- Some methodological descriptions, particularly regarding spatial language resolution, are confusing and lack quantitative evaluation.
- The performance of the NER model on certain categories is notably low, raising concerns about its robustness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methods for resolving spatial language, ensuring that they provide a quantitative evaluation of this component. Additionally, we suggest conducting a broader analysis across multiple cities to enhance the generalizability of the findings. The authors should also clarify the correlation metrics used in their analysis and evaluate the performance of the lightweight toponym resolution method. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include a detailed explanation of the NER model's tagging scheme and the parameters used in their Kernel Density Estimation procedure. Lastly, we recommend comparing their models against existing approaches in toponym recognition and resolution to contextualize their contributions better.
