Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework addressing online experimentation with network interference, where a learner assigns actions to units over time to minimize regret. The authors propose a novel approach using discrete Fourier analysis to reformulate the problem as a linear bandit, allowing for the development of an explore-then-commit algorithm that achieves a high-probability regret bound of (T A^s)^(â…”) with logarithmic dependence on N. The study emphasizes the sparsity structure of interference, which significantly reduces the effective action space.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a novel formulation of the bandit-with-interference problem as a linear bandit using discrete Fourier analysis.
- The problem is well-motivated by practical applications, and the methods are original and mathematically elegant.
- The analysis is sound, and the algorithms are presented clearly, with thorough exposition of results.

Weaknesses:
- The exposition could be clearer regarding the per-subset basis for estimating effects, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with Boolean Fourier analysis.
- The algorithm design appears standard after the transformation to functional space, raising questions about the sufficiency of the contribution.
- There is a lack of real-world examples demonstrating the interplay between online experimentation and interference, and the implications of Assumption 2 are not thoroughly discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the exposition, particularly regarding the per-subset basis for estimating effects, to aid readers less familiar with Boolean Fourier analysis. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion on the practical implications of the Fourier analysis in this context, specifically what advantages it provides over previous methods. It would also be beneficial to incorporate real-world examples to illustrate the combination of online experimentation and interference. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore the potential for adapting their algorithm to incorporate specific network structures, as well as to clarify the implications of Assumption 2 regarding the upper bound s for all units.
