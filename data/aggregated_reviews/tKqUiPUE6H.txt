Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a deep ensemble model utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of aircraft engines. The authors aim to quantify uncertainty in predictions using deep ensembles, supported by a comprehensive evaluation of model performance through metrics such as Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Coefficient of Determination (RÂ²), and Negative Log Likelihood (NLL). The dataset employed is an open-source simulation from NASA, which models turbo engine behavior under various conditions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a thorough literature review on uncertainty quantification methods, particularly focusing on state-of-the-art Bayesian approximations.
- It introduces a novel approach to engine health monitoring, effectively addressing a critical issue in predictive maintenance.
- The LSTM model architecture is well-documented, and the use of open-source datasets is clearly explained.
- The focus on quantifying both Aleatoric and Epistemic uncertainties offers valuable insights into model confidence levels.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks citations of relevant literature on uncertainty quantification for RUL prediction, which could provide essential comparisons and context.
- There is insufficient detail on how predictive uncertainty is decomposed into its respective parts.
- The absence of real-world testing and baseline comparisons limits the practical applicability and effectiveness assessment of the proposed model.
- Limited discussion on hyperparameter optimization and the rationale behind their selection is noted, along with a lack of interpretability in model predictions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by including relevant works on uncertainty quantification for RUL prediction, such as those by Xu et al., Sankararaman and Goebel, and Xuan et al. Additionally, the authors should clarify the methodology for decomposing predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components. 

We suggest incorporating real-world testing to validate the model's performance and including baseline comparisons with existing methods to gauge its effectiveness. A more detailed discussion on hyperparameter optimization techniques and their impact on model performance would enhance the manuscript. Finally, addressing the interpretability of model predictions is crucial for practical applications, and we encourage the authors to explore this aspect further.
