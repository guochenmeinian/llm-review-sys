### Key Points
This paper explores the relationship between EEG and language, proposing a Multimodal Transformer Alignment Model (MTAM) that utilizes a dual-encoder with cross-alignment between EEG and language data. The authors employ canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and Wasserstein distance (WD) as alignment mechanisms, demonstrating the model's effectiveness across two downstream tasks. The authors also provide publicly available software for reproducibility.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is one of the first to investigate the connection between EEG and language using computational multimodal methods.
- The proposed MTAM model shows strong performance in downstream tasks, surpassing non-alignment methods.
- The availability of code enhances reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity in addressing fundamental questions about the alignment of discrete language data with continuous EEG signals and the inherent subjectivity of EEG data.
- The interpretation of results, particularly regarding the implications of EEG features, is insufficiently supported by statistical analysis.
- Methodological explanations are vague, particularly regarding the differences between model versions and the rationale for chosen alignment metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions by addressing the following high-level questions:
1. How do you explain the alignment between discrete language data and continuous EEG data?
2. How do you handle the subjectivity and variability inherent in EEG signals to extract consistent features?
3. Why were CCA and WD chosen as alignment mechanisms over alternatives like KL divergence or Euclidean distance?
4. How did you combine CCA and WD, and why is this explanation not included in the main paper?

Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more detailed discussion on the interpretation of EEG data, including how artifacts are managed and the rationale behind the reported near-100% accuracy. The authors should also clarify the differences among the model versions referenced in Table 1 and ensure that terminology, such as "connectivity," is clearly defined. Finally, the paper requires thorough proofreading to correct grammatical errors and undefined acronyms before submission.
