### Key Points
This paper presents a non-intrusive graph distributed backdoor attack (NI-GDBA) for Federated Graph Learning (FGL), which enables malicious clients to exploit natural backdoors in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) without data poisoning. The method utilizes clustering techniques for subgraph selection and adaptive perturbation for trigger generation, achieving high attack success rates (ASR) while maintaining task accuracy across various datasets. The authors address challenges in existing methods, such as model performance degradation and the need for numerous malicious clients.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of NI-GDBA is innovative, allowing for stealthy backdoor trigger generation without data poisoning.
- The method leverages graph theory for efficient node clustering, enhancing explainability.
- Extensive experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing methods.

Weaknesses:
- The ablation study shows effectiveness only on specific datasets, lacking broader evaluation.
- Insufficient comparisons with existing methods and unclear algorithm descriptions hinder clarity.
- Theoretical gaps exist regarding the concept of "Learning Natural Backdoor" and its implications.
- Limited discussion on the applicability of the method in heterogeneous environments and potential defenses.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the ablation study by evaluating the method on additional datasets to address its limitations. A more comprehensive comparison with existing methods is necessary to clarify the contributions of NI-GDBA. The authors should provide a detailed description of Algorithm 2, specifying whether the ranking refers to bottom-k or top-k selection. Additionally, we suggest including sensitivity analyses for parameters such as $\theta$ and $\beta$ to assess their impact on performance. Clarifying the motivation behind the choice of important nodes for trigger insertion and expanding the discussion on potential defenses against the attack would also enhance the paper's depth.
