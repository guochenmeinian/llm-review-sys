Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the theoretical foundations of multivariate distributional reinforcement learning (RL), focusing on convergence proofs under the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) distance. The authors propose a randomized dynamic programming method and introduce algorithms such as multivariate EWP-TD and signed-categorical-TD. They provide an upper bound on MMD concerning dimension \(d\) and conduct experiments primarily in a tabular MDP environment. Additionally, the paper includes a theoretical analysis of the EWP-TD method, addressing challenges associated with projections in higher dimensions. The authors clarify the implications of Theorem 3 regarding the number of particles required for achieving a specified error tolerance, \(\epsilon\), and compare their method to unprojected DP, demonstrating that their approach requires significantly fewer particles.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The convergence proof extending univariate dynamic programming (DP) to multivariate settings is technically sound, and the writing is rigorous.
- The paper is accessible to first-time readers, utilizing clear notations and excellent visualizations for the proposed algorithms.
- The theoretical contributions regarding categorical representation are novel and informative, matching results from univariate cases.
- The authors provide a convincing comparison with unprojected DP, enhancing the paper's clarity and impact.
- The response to reviewer queries demonstrates a thorough understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of their work.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution appears limited in scope, primarily investigating convergence under MMD, which seems incremental given existing literature.
- The organization of the paper is less concentrated, with abrupt shifts between topics that may obscure the paper's contribution.
- The experiments are limited to simple toy examples, lacking generality and practical relevance, which raises concerns about the applicability of the findings.
- The theoretical analysis of EWP-TD remains perceived as insufficient, particularly in comparison to Categorical-TD.
- The complexity of the projection in EWP-TD for dimensions greater than one poses challenges that are not fully addressed in the current analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for multivariate distributional RL by providing concrete examples and conducting more extensive experiments in realistic environments, such as Atari games or Mujoco. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the organization of the paper to ensure a more coherent flow between sections. Clarifying notations and definitions, especially in the categorical representation section, would also improve understanding. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis of EWP-TD to better match the depth provided for Categorical-TD. Expanding on the challenges associated with projections in higher dimensions and providing more comprehensive results for EWP-TD would strengthen the paper. Finally, incorporating the comparison with unprojected DP into the main text would enhance clarity and reinforce the paper's contributions.
