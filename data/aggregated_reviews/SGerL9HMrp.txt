### Key Points
This paper studies nonparametric contextual bandit problems with distributional shifts, introducing a new notion termed "experienced significant shifts." The authors develop algorithms that achieve minimax optimal regret without requiring knowledge of problem-dependent parameters. Additionally, the paper addresses the contextual bandits problem with changing Lipschitz reward functions, presenting both upper and lower bounds for minimax optimality. The authors propose an algorithm based on a hierarchical partition tree to discretize the context space.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of "experienced significant shifts" enhances the understanding of distribution shifts in contextual bandits.
- The algorithms developed achieve minimax optimal regret, closing existing gaps in the literature.
- The paper is well-organized, with clear explanations of key ideas and theoretical results.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks formal results for the generalizations mentioned, such as H\"older continuity.
- The algorithm's complexity may hinder understanding; simplifying the recursive structure could improve readability.
- There are no experimental results to validate the proposed algorithms, which is disappointing given the detailed algorithm description.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the algorithm by replacing Line 9 in Algorithm 2 with a while-loop to enhance readability. Additionally, we encourage the authors to provide formal statements for the generalizations mentioned and to elaborate on the oracle procedure in Definition 7, specifying what is known and unknown. Including experimental results would significantly strengthen the paper. Lastly, we suggest discussing the adaptivity issue in more depth, particularly in relation to existing literature on minimax rates and the assumptions made in this setting.
