Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents MPOT, a gradient-free optimization method for motion planning that utilizes the Sinkhorn step, a zero-order parallelizable update rule. The method is designed to optimize a batch of smooth trajectories with nonlinear costs, demonstrating improved planning speed and success rates across various tasks. The authors conduct empirical studies to validate the effectiveness of their approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses the critical problem of trajectory smoothing in motion planning, proposing a solid and novel method.
- The Sinkhorn step and MPOT are well-detailed, contributing significantly to the field.
- The writing is clear and the paper is well-organized, making it accessible.
- Empirical results indicate significant performance improvements.

Weaknesses:
- Benchmarking results primarily focus on settings where RRT*/I-RRT* perform well; exploring scenarios where RRT* fails could highlight additional advantages of MPOT.
- The authors only compare MPOT to GPMP2 in mobile manipulation experiments, neglecting other relevant baselines.
- The batch optimization approach requires sequences to share the same length, limiting flexibility in processing trajectories with varying waypoint counts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the benchmarking by including scenarios where RRT* fails to better illustrate the advantages of MPOT. Additionally, we suggest expanding the comparison to include other baseline methods alongside GPMP2 to strengthen the case for MPOT's effectiveness. Addressing the limitations of batch optimization regarding varying waypoint numbers would enhance the algorithm's flexibility. Furthermore, a more detailed discussion on the potential applications of the Sinkhorn step could significantly enrich the contributions of the paper.
