### Key Points
This paper investigates the performance of modern large language models (LLMs) on syllogisms involving morphologically negative words and step-by-step reasoning, particularly under lexical negation. The authors conduct a thorough evaluation across 31 models, revealing that model performance degrades with the introduction of fictional referents and mismatched negation in instructions. The findings indicate a lack of sufficient "pure reasoning" ability in LLMs, suggesting that their chain-of-thought (CoT) performance is influenced by multiple factors beyond the reasoning structure.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and presents a thorough evaluation of various models, providing a comprehensive understanding of LLM performance under different conditions.  
- The methods are sound, and the authors conducted numerous auxiliary experiments to ensure robustness.  
- The results highlight interesting differences in model behavior, particularly the varying performance across model families.

Weaknesses:  
- The averaging of results from different domains in the main text may obscure specific model behaviors.  
- Some aspects, such as the weight transitivity task, are not adequately mentioned in the main text, which could lead to a lack of awareness among readers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their results by using a single domain for Tables 2 and 3, while referring to the appendix for additional data. Additionally, consider presenting metrics beyond accuracy, such as the minimum of the F1 scores between classes, to better reflect model performance. It would also be beneficial to mention the weight transitivity task in the main text to ensure all readers are informed of the comprehensive work conducted.
