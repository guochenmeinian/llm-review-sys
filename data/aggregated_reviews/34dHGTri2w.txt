Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel parallel sampling method named "Follow Hamiltonian Leader" (FHL) that leverages zeroth-order information to tackle sampling challenges, particularly when first-order data is unreliable. The method enhances efficiency through a leader-guiding mechanism, allowing multiple replicas to operate at different energy levels. Experimental results indicate that FHL significantly improves exploration of target distributions and outperforms traditional techniques, especially in scenarios with corrupted gradients.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The innovative integration of zeroth and first-order information enhances sampling efficiency and quality.
2. The method demonstrates resilience against corrupted gradients, making it valuable in challenging scenarios.
3. Thorough experimental evaluations across various scenarios illustrate the method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. The complexity of the FHL method may increase implementation difficulty and computational resource demands.
2. There is a lack of quantitative experiments, such as evaluating FID and IS on datasets like CIFAR10, to substantiate the method's advantages.
3. The paper does not adequately address the scalability of the method to high-dimensional problems or large datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis to establish convergence properties and performance guarantees for the FHL method. Additionally, including quantitative evaluations on datasets with complex distributions, such as CIFAR10, would strengthen the paper. The authors should also explore the sensitivity of key hyperparameters, particularly the tension coefficient $\lambda$, and provide an ablation study to clarify its impact on performance. Finally, a discussion on the computational overhead compared to baseline methods would enhance the manuscript's comprehensiveness.
