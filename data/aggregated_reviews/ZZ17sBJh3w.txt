### Key Points
This paper presents the APDDv2 dataset, an enhanced resource for evaluating the aesthetics of artistic images, expanding upon its predecessor, APDDv1. The dataset includes 10,000 images and nearly 90,000 expert annotations, encompassing various artistic categories and multi-dimensional aesthetic attributes. The authors propose the ArtCLIP model, which demonstrates improved accuracy in aesthetic evaluations. The dataset's meticulous construction and expert involvement address significant gaps in artistic image analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset benefits from domain expert annotations, enhancing its quality.
- It provides a comprehensive categorization of art, allowing for nuanced analysis.
- The methodologies are clearly articulated, making the paper accessible.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a discussion on the variance in scores among different raters, which is crucial given the subjective nature of aesthetic evaluations.
- There is insufficient focus on the practical applications of the dataset and its potential real-world impact.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of variance in ratings among different raters to understand the consistency of evaluations better. Additionally, we suggest focusing more on the practical applications of the dataset and benchmarking it with a wider range of pre-trained Vision Language models. Addressing these aspects could significantly enhance the paper's impact and relevance in the field.
