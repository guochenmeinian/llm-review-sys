Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Adaptive-Interval Color Transformation (AICT) method for harmonizing high-resolution composite images. The authors propose a parameter network that predicts multiple curves as 3D LUTs for pixel-wise color transformation at low resolution. AICT enhances this by splitting each predicted 3D LUT into two and employing a global consistent weight learning method to predict image-level weights for each transformation. Experiments on datasets such as iHarmony4 and ccHarmony demonstrate promising quantitative results for AICT.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The originality of AICT is evident as it clearly differentiates itself from existing high-resolution image harmonization methods.
2. The proposed method is technically sound and complete, with convincing experimental settings and metrics.
3. Sufficient implementation details are provided for reproducibility.
4. Quantitative results indicate superior or comparable performance in harmonizing high-resolution and low-resolution composite images.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of using two 3D LUTs is limited and lacks necessary discussions and experimental verifications.
2. The paper does not adequately explain the "non-linearities" in color transformation, nor do the visual results illustrate significant advantages.
3. Claims regarding AICT's lightweight nature are contradicted by performance comparisons, as it runs slower than some existing methods.
4. The novelty of the "global consistent weight method" is not well-explained.
5. Clarity issues arise from vague descriptions of key contributions and insufficient discussions on the relationship between AICT and existing methods.
6. The paper's writing contains repeated sentences and redundant references, and some figures lack necessary context.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the novelty of the proposed 3D LUTs-based adaptive-interval color transformation, particularly in relation to existing methods. Additionally, the authors should clarify the "non-linearities" mentioned and provide visual results that substantiate the claimed advantages. We suggest that the authors tone down claims regarding AICT's computational efficiency based on performance comparisons. Furthermore, a more detailed discussion of the "global consistent weight method" is necessary to clarify its novelty. The authors should also address clarity issues by refining the writing, removing redundancies, and ensuring all figures are self-contained. Finally, we encourage the authors to conduct further experiments using the HAdobe5k dataset and include user studies to assess perceptual quality.
