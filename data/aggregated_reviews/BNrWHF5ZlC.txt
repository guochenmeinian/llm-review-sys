### Key Points
We note that the paper presents a medical image segmentation model optimized for CPU deployment, utilizing the EfficientViT-SAM architecture and dynamic quantization. The authors enhance grayscale images through a three-channel technique, which includes retaining the raw image, applying anisotropic diffusion, and histogram equalization. The model demonstrates improved performance metrics, including a 4.37% increase in dice score and a 2.85% increase in normalized surface dice compared to the baseline, while achieving faster inference speeds.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
- The model achieves a dice score of 88.54% and a normalized surface dice of 98.28%, outperforming the baseline.
- The preprocessing technique for grayscale images effectively enhances segmentation accuracy.
- Dynamic quantization significantly reduces inference time, reportedly by up to five times.

**Weaknesses:**
- An ablation study is needed to clarify the contributions of the three-channel sampling and dynamic quantization.
- The explanation of the three-channel preprocessing lacks detail, hindering reproducibility.
- The model struggles with bounding box prompts containing multiple regions, leading to segmentation inaccuracies.
- The reported NSD value of 98.28% appears unusually high compared to the public validation leaderboard, raising concerns about its accuracy.
- Missing details regarding model training and knowledge distillation reduce reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We suggest including a reference for each dataset in Table 1 to enhance clarity. Additionally, we recommend providing more detailed explanations of the three-channel preprocessing in the methods section to improve reproducibility. Clarifying the training process, particularly regarding knowledge distillation, and ensuring the validation set aligns with the official one would strengthen the paper's credibility. Finally, we encourage the authors to address the unexpected performance improvements from dynamic quantization and conduct an ablation study to better understand the contributions of each component to the final performance.
