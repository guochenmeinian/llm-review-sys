Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of the assumptions for biased Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and proposes a more general and weaker ABC assumption that encompasses existing assumptions. The authors provide a detailed comparison with the literature, aiming to unify the framework for biased SGD. They validate their theoretical findings through experimental results, demonstrating the effectiveness of their proposed assumptions in both convex and non-convex settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper effectively links various assumptions used in biased SGD literature and presents them clearly in Figure 1. It proposes a set of assumptions that can guarantee the same iteration complexity as unbiased SGD, which is valuable for researchers addressing new problems requiring biased SGD.

Weaknesses:  
The paper overlooks significant literature on biased SGD in broader contexts, such as stochastic compositional optimization and meta-learning, which diminishes the claim of being a comprehensive guide. The proposed ABC assumption's utility and validation remain unclear, and the paper's focus on iteration complexity neglects other important factors like sample size and computational costs. Additionally, the organization of the paper, particularly the lengthy appendix, complicates navigation and understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by incorporating and discussing relevant references on biased SGD methods beyond classical settings. Specifically, it would be insightful to compare the methodologies of biased gradient estimators from the literature. The authors should also clarify the practical implications and validation of the ABC assumption, addressing its potential limitations. Furthermore, we suggest reorganizing the paper to enhance readability, possibly by moving less critical results to the appendix and including more examples in the main body. Lastly, addressing the concerns regarding the clarity of Figure 1 and the overall presentation would strengthen the paper's impact.
