Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive framework for evaluating the decision-making behavior of large language models (LLMs) under uncertain contexts, utilizing behavioral economic theories. The authors investigate risk preferences, probability weighting, and loss aversion across three commercial LLMs: ChatGPT-4.0-Turbo, Claude-3-Opus, and Gemini-1.0-pro. The study also examines the influence of socio-demographic features on decision-making, revealing significant variations and potential biases. The authors conclude with a call for ethical standards in LLM decision-making.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel framework for evaluating LLMs' decision-making behavior, marking the first application of behavioral economics to LLMs without preset behavioral tendencies.
- It provides empirical evidence of LLMs' tendencies towards risk aversion and loss aversion, offering insights into their alignment with or divergence from human behavior.
- The investigation of socio-demographic influences on LLM behavior is crucial for understanding potential biases.

Weaknesses:
- The lack of human data limits the exploration of LLM versus human behavior at the parameter level, which could elucidate deeper similarities or differences.
- The authors rely solely on the TCN model for evaluation, which may not adequately capture the complexity of LLM behaviors. Multiple competing models should be proposed to enhance robustness and model evidence.
- The focus on three commercial LLMs may restrict the applicability of findings to open-source models, and comparisons with more transparent models could strengthen the contribution.
- The paper does not sufficiently analyze the causes behind observed variations in LLM behavior when demographic features are introduced.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the depth of their analysis by incorporating human data to compare LLM and human decision-making behaviors at the parameter level. Additionally, we suggest the authors explore multiple cognitive models to evaluate LLM behaviors, as this could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms. It would also be beneficial to include comparisons with open-source LLMs and investigate the relationship between model size and measured parameters. Lastly, a more detailed analysis of the potential causes of observed demographic variations in LLM behavior would enhance the paper's contributions.
