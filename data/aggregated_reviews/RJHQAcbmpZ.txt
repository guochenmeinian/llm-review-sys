### Key Points
This paper presents a unified view of high-dimensional Bayesian optimization (HDBO) for applications in biology and chemistry, particularly drug discovery. The authors provide a detailed taxonomy of current methods and introduce two open-source benchmark packages, poli and poli-benchmark, for consistent model comparison. They benchmark eight popular latent space BO methods on a small molecule task, contributing to the literature by organizing and categorizing various methods in a sub-field that lacks unifying concepts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and structured, providing a comprehensive taxonomy that aids navigation through the complex field of HDBO methods.  
- It introduces new thematic areas and examples, enhancing the existing literature.  
- The authors' code is professional, well-maintained, and demonstrates attention to detail in benchmarking.

Weaknesses:  
- The introduction of the poli and poli-baseline libraries is insufficient, lacking practical demonstration for benchmarking discrete sequence optimization tasks.  
- The benchmarking section feels underwhelming and appears as an afterthought, failing to provide sufficient insights or comparisons with existing libraries.  
- The choice of tasks for benchmarking is questionable, as they do not extend beyond previous works, and there is a lack of discussion on the limitations of the current approach.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction of the poli and poli-baseline libraries by detailing the baseline methods included, the specific tasks, the API, and practical usage for practitioners. Additionally, we suggest providing a more thorough comparison of the benchmarking methods, including insights into the benchmarking process and justifications for the chosen methods. It would be beneficial to introduce the problem being benchmarked more clearly and to consider benchmarking larger sequence lengths or different tasks, such as protein sequence design. Finally, enhancing the clarity of the societal impact discussion and ensuring all figures have appropriate axis labels would strengthen the paper.
