Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on generative knowledge graph completion, focusing on enhancing transformer-based models by incorporating neighborhood information from head nodes into queries. The authors demonstrate their findings on both transductive and inductive benchmarks, showing that the inclusion of neighborhood information improves performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for the study is clear and well-articulated.
- The results indicate that adding neighborhood information significantly aids model performance.
- The approach of using neighborhood information is intuitive and rational for knowledge graph completion tasks.

Weaknesses:
- Some background information is lacking, particularly regarding language models like T5 and KGT5, which may hinder understanding for less knowledgeable readers.
- The contribution is limited, as it represents a small extension of existing models, and the performance gains on ILPC datasets are modest.
- Certain experimental results appear underwhelming, particularly in the inductive setting, raising questions about the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the background section by including a brief introduction to language models, especially T5 and KGT5, in the appendix. Additionally, the authors should address the performance discrepancies noted, particularly why T5-SMALL PRE-TRAINED performs worse than non-pretrained models. It would also be beneficial to include more comparisons with existing transformer-based KGC models and to clarify the methodology regarding the selection of relevant neighbor triplets. Lastly, we suggest restructuring the paper to emphasize the main experimental takeaways more prominently.
