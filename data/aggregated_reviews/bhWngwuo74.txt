### Key Points
This paper presents FR-CSU, a federated recommendation framework designed to address the cold-start problem for users by facilitating knowledge transfer from warm clients while ensuring privacy. The authors propose innovative components such as user prototype networks and adaptive knowledge fusion mechanisms. The experiments conducted demonstrate that FR-CSU outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The cold-start problem in federated recommendation is a significant and timely research topic.
2. The paper is well-structured and easy to read, with clear identification of challenges faced by cold-start users.
3. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper's technical framework and experiments bear similarities to existing works, particularly in its reliance on a prototype network without sufficient clarification of unique contributions.
2. The coverage of FedRS methods in the experiments is limited, and only two datasets are utilized without adequate justification for their selection.
3. Some sections lack detail, particularly regarding the training processes of the user prototype network and the FFNs, which may hinder understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the technical contributions by explicitly detailing how the prototype network trained on warm users can effectively predict information for new users. Additionally, we suggest including a broader range of FedRS methods for comparison in the experiments and providing a more comprehensive description of the datasets used. It would also be beneficial to run experiments multiple times to ensure reliability and to analyze how different training configurations affect communication overhead. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore the impact of varying the parameter \( \gamma \) in the knowledge fusion mechanism and to include accuracy as an evaluation metric for the CTR task to enhance the comprehensiveness of the results.
