Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for registering 2D images and 3D point clouds, utilizing a three-branch architecture that processes 2D images, 3D point clouds, and 3D voxels. The fused features from 3D point clouds and voxels establish correspondences with 2D image features, employing a differentiable PnP solver for end-to-end training. Experiments on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing baseline methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The three-branch structure is a novel approach for this task, effectively enhancing registration performance.
2. The proposed method shows superior performance compared to existing methods in experimental settings.
3. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
1. The practical significance of the proposed work is questionable; the authors should clarify scenarios where this registration method is essential compared to traditional device calibration methods.
2. The ablation study has methodological issues, including differing experimental settings and insufficient analysis of component contributions to performance gains.
3. The authors did not mention the use of a validation set or the criteria for model selection during inference.
4. The role of RANSAC in improving registration performance for both the proposed and comparison methods is not explored.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the practical significance discussion by providing real-world scenarios where their registration method is necessary. Additionally, the authors should align the ablation study settings with the main experiments for consistency and stability, and conduct further analyses to clarify the contributions of individual components. It is also essential to specify whether a validation set is used and how the best model is selected for inference. Finally, the authors should explore the potential application of RANSAC in the comparison methods to enhance their performance.
