Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel optimization framework, Trace, based on Optimization with Trace Oracle (OPTO), which treats computational workflows as dynamic graphs. The authors propose OptoPrime, a general optimizer leveraging large language models (LLMs), and demonstrate its effectiveness across various tasks, including numerical optimization, traffic control, and robotic control. The results indicate that Trace outperforms traditional LLM-based optimizers like OPRO and offers a Python interface for seamless integration with PyTorch.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces an innovative approach by using execution traces instead of gradients, enabling optimization of non-differentiable workflows.
2. Trace is applicable to a wide range of tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to other LLM-based optimizers and comparable results to traditional gradient-based methods.
3. The clarity of writing and structure enhances understanding, making complex concepts accessible.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a comparison with "TEXTGRAD: Automatic Differentiation via Text," a concurrent work.
2. The narrative structure could be improved; the problem specification and algorithm should precede software details.
3. Limited scalability of OptoPrime is noted, particularly in handling numerous parameters or nodes that cannot be represented textually.
4. The experimental section shows limited improvement, with insignificant differences between Trace and OPRO.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the narrative structure by presenting the problem specification and algorithm before discussing the software details. Additionally, we suggest including a comparison with "TEXTGRAD" to strengthen the paper's contributions. To address scalability concerns, the authors should demonstrate how Trace can handle larger numbers of parameters and more complex workflows. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the definition of a trace and provide a more detailed analysis of the experimental results, particularly regarding the differences observed in the ablation studies.
