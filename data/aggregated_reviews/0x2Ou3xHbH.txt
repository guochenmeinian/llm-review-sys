Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into online learning in time-varying games, specifically focusing on the optimistic gradient descent (OGD) algorithm applied by all players. The authors derive results for two-player bilinear games, showing that the sum of squared duality gaps is bounded by \(O(1 + V_{\epsilon-NE} + V_A)\), which aligns with the best-known results in stationary game setups. They extend these findings to strongly convex-concave games and explore potential and general-sum game setups with guarantees on duality gaps and correlated equilibria gaps. The paper includes experimental validation of theoretical results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant problem, demonstrating that the classic OGD algorithm achieves favorable average duality-gap and equilibrium-related bounds with provable guarantees.
- Experimental results on time-varying potential and zero-sum games substantiate the theoretical NE gap bounds.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the paper is questionable, as it shares similarities with results from [60], including Lemma A.1 and Property A.3, which closely resemble findings in that work.
- The analysis appears to be an extension of [60] rather than a distinct contribution, particularly regarding the approximated NE path-length and the boundedness of second-order dynamics.
- The paper lacks sufficient clarity in some sections, particularly in defining key properties and comparing results with previous work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their exposition, especially in Section 1.1, by defining the MVI property and RVU bound more explicitly. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed discussion on the main technical challenges compared to [60] and clarify the relationship between the epsilon-NE path-length and \(W_T\). It would also be beneficial to include lower bounds to demonstrate the optimality of their results and to enhance the self-contained nature of the paper by providing more context for borrowed ideas from [60].
