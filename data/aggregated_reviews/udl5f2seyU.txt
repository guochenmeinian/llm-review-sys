### Key Points
This paper presents DIFAIR, a human-annotated dataset aimed at evaluating gender bias and knowledge in masked language models (MLMs). The authors argue that existing benchmarks inadequately assess debiased models, neglecting scenarios where gender knowledge is crucial. They introduce a new metric, GIS, to measure gender bias while evaluating how well models retain gender knowledge. The findings suggest that improvements in fairness may compromise gender knowledge, highlighting a significant gap between model and human performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The introduction of the DIFAIR dataset provides a valuable resource for evaluating gender bias in MLMs.  
- The proposed GIS metric offers a novel approach to measure gender bias and assess gender knowledge retention.  
- The analysis reveals important insights into the trade-off between bias reduction and gender knowledge preservation.

Weaknesses:  
- The performance of recent large language models is not evaluated, raising concerns about DIFAIR's applicability.  
- Reproducibility is questionable due to the lack of information on code and data availability.  
- The paper does not empirically compare DIFAIR with relevant datasets like CrowS-Pairs and StereoSet, nor does it compare the GIS metric with other bias evaluation metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including performance metrics for recently proposed large language models to establish DIFAIR's relevance. Additionally, we suggest making the code and dataset publicly available to enhance reproducibility. The authors should also consider comparing DIFAIR with existing datasets and the GIS metric with other bias evaluation metrics to strengthen their claims. Finally, providing mathematical equations for GNS and GIS separately, along with visualizations of vector embeddings, could further clarify the retention of gender knowledge in models.
