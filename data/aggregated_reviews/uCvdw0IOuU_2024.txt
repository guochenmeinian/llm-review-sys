Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method, DDL-CXR, that addresses the asynchronicity problem in multimodal clinical data, specifically between electronic health records (EHR) and chest X-ray (CXR) images. The authors propose using a latent diffusion model to generate up-to-date latent representations of CXR images based on previous X-ray data and EHR time series. The experiments conducted on MIMIC datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing methods in phenotype and mortality prediction tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is technically solid, with thorough experiments and a comparison against various baselines.
- The motivation for addressing asynchronicity in clinical data is compelling, and the proposed method shows consistent improvements.

Weaknesses:
- The clinical impact of the work is limited, as improvements are primarily noted when the time interval exceeds 36 hours, which may not align with best clinical practices.
- The methodology lacks clarity, particularly regarding the integration of EHR data and the attention mechanism.
- There is a need for expert validation of the model's efficacy, as current metrics may not fully capture its clinical relevance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and detail in the methodology section, particularly in describing the latent diffusion model and the integration of EHR data. Additionally, including an ablation study for reduced training data would provide insights into the model's sensitivity. We suggest that the authors incorporate expert evaluation by radiologists to assess generation quality, as this would enhance the modelâ€™s clinical applicability. Furthermore, addressing the asynchronicity explicitly in the contributions section would clarify the paper's focus. Lastly, including a patient cohort table in the appendix would provide essential context for the data used in the study.
