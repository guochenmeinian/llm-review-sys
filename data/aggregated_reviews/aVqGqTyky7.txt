### Key Points
This paper presents a distant supervision-based machine reading comprehension (MRC) method that combines contrastive learning with a confidence-aware sampling strategy for negative instances. The authors propose a modified loss function and confidence estimation formulas. Experimental results on NaturalQA and TrivialQA indicate that the proposed method is effective, outperforming both existing distant supervision methods and, under certain conditions, supervised methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses well-known issues in distant supervision, specifically the answer bias and context noise problems.
- The proposed method demonstrates solid experimental support and reports state-of-the-art results.
- The mechanism of debiasing and denoising is clearly described, and the confidence-aware contrastive loss is easy to understand.

Weaknesses:
- The term 'counterfactual' is used ambiguously, leading to confusion regarding its logical implications.
- There is a lack of detailed explanation regarding the model's deep mechanisms and the dynamic update of confidence scores.
- Inconsistent symbol usage may lead to confusion, and an overview of the workflow is needed for clarity.
- The paper lacks an ethics statement and contains minor typographical errors.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the term 'counterfactual' to align with its logical definition. Additionally, we suggest providing more detailed analysis and explanation of the model's mechanisms, particularly regarding the dynamic confidence score updates. Addressing the inconsistent symbol usage and including an overview of the workflow would enhance the paper's clarity. Finally, we advise the authors to add an ethics statement and correct any typographical errors, such as the one noted on Line 496.
