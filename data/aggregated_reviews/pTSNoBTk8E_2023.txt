Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DynaDojo, a benchmark platform for system identification in complex dynamical systems, which has been significantly enhanced with the addition of 20 systems, including 13 new real-world application-driven systems and 3 new PDE systems. It measures sample efficiency and generalization of algorithms across various classes of dynamical systems, providing a user-friendly API that supports multiple models and evaluation metrics. The platform emphasizes computational efficiency through resource-efficient training and parallel processing. The authors evaluate several baseline algorithms using DynaDojo, aiming to establish it as a comprehensive benchmarking tool for system identification. They have updated the GitHub documentation and demos for each system, improving accessibility for users, and incorporated models from existing libraries while providing a comparison with related benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
1. The paper introduces an extensible framework addressing the significant problem of system identification, applicable across various domains.
2. The addition of diverse systems enhances the platform's applicability to real-world scenarios.
3. It is well-organized, clearly highlighting DynaDojo's features that facilitate exploration of active learning algorithms, thus broadening the research landscape.
4. Improved documentation and demos facilitate user engagement and understanding.
5. Integration with existing models from notable libraries strengthens the platform's credibility.
6. The initial benchmarks and models provide a reasonable demonstration of the platform's benefits.

**Weaknesses:**
1. The platform inadequately addresses critical aspects of system identification, such as control input selection, sampling frequency, and noise considerations.
2. The explanation of different types of generalizations lacks technical detail and evaluation.
3. The comparison with existing benchmarks is insufficient, particularly regarding capabilities like active learning.
4. The platform currently supports only four classes of dynamical systems, limiting its applicability.
5. Some reviewers expressed concerns about the handling of PDEs, noting a lack of examples and potential implementation challenges.
6. The paper's writing could still be more compact for a machine learning audience.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the platform by addressing the following points:
1. Expand the scope of system identification to include aspects like control input selection, sampling frequency, and noise handling.
2. Provide a more detailed explanation of the types of generalizations and how the platform evaluates them.
3. Include a comparative analysis with existing benchmarks to clarify the advantages of DynaDojo.
4. Increase the number of supported dynamical system classes to enhance the platform's applicability and relevance.
5. Clarify the definition of "reliability of generated trajectories" and provide concrete examples of system complexity measures.
6. Illustrate how the platform can quantify the trade-off between sample efficiency and generalizability.
7. Consider incorporating optimal experimental design principles and providing examples demonstrating various objectives in system identification.
8. Improve the clarity and compactness of the writing to better suit a machine learning audience.
9. Provide more concrete examples of PDE implementations to address concerns raised about their handling.
10. Include relevant plots and results from the GitHub demos in the supplementary material to enhance the paper's comprehensiveness.
