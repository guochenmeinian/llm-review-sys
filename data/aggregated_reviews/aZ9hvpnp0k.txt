Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new data augmentation method called Anchor Data Augmentation (ADA) for regression datasets, leveraging concepts from Anchor Regression to generate augmented samples. The authors demonstrate that ADA can enhance performance in various regression models, particularly in over-parameterized settings. The method is empirically evaluated across multiple datasets, showing competitive results compared to existing methods like C-Mixup.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents a theoretically motivated augmentation approach.
- ADA is applicable to various regression models, including neural networks, and shows improved performance in low data regimes.
- The method is simple to implement, utilizing k-means clustering to generate anchor variables.

Weaknesses:
- The results do not show significant improvements over baselines in both low and high data regimes.
- The theoretical justification for the connection between ADA and Anchor Regression is unclear.
- The evaluation is limited to comparisons with C-Mixup, lacking broader context with other augmentation techniques.
- The paper introduces many hyperparameters without sufficient analysis on their impact or methods for tuning them.
- Statistical significance of results is not reported, making it difficult to assess the robustness of findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical explanation of how ADA relates to Anchor Regression and clarify the choice of hyperparameters. Additionally, the authors should broaden their comparisons to include a wider range of data augmentation methods and provide more detailed analyses of the results, including standard deviations. Exploring the application of ADA to other domains beyond housing datasets and addressing potential overfitting in homogeneous data scenarios would also enhance the paper's contributions. Finally, we suggest investigating the computational efficiency of ADA compared to other methods and considering automatic tuning of hyperparameters to simplify the implementation.
