Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the structural information in state sequences for reinforcement learning, proposing a Fourier transformation-based prediction method as an auxiliary task to enhance policy learning. The authors provide theoretical results demonstrating the existence of structural information and report experimental results on MuJoCo tasks that indicate the effectiveness of their method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The idea of predicting the Fourier spectrum is intriguing and may effectively extract hidden information in the time domain, representing a significant contribution.
- Experimental results show that the proposed auxiliary task improves policy learning for RL agents, particularly with SAC and PPO.

Weaknesses:
- There is a disconnect between the motivation and implementation; the algorithm (SPF) uses a parameterized prediction module rather than directly leveraging the Fourier domain.
- The method's ability to capture long-term information is questionable, as it only considers two adjacent states as inputs.
- The significance of Theorem 1 may be limited due to a potentially loose upper bound, and the implications of the l1 norm in Equation (3) are unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the connection between the motivation for using Fourier transformations and the implementation of the SPF algorithm. Additionally, the authors should address the method's capacity to capture long-term dependencies by considering a broader range of state inputs. We also suggest providing a more robust justification for the significance of Theorem 1 and clarifying the implications of the l1 norm in their analysis. Lastly, the authors should elaborate on the inherent structural information derived from the Fourier transform and discuss the limitations of their approach more comprehensively.
