Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on designing no-regret algorithms with adaptivity to sparsity, game-dependency, and Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) settings. The authors propose a new adaptive learning rate, termed Stability-Penalty-Adaptive (SPA), for Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL). They achieve the first $s$-agnostic regret bound in the adversarial regime and develop a Best-of-Both-Worlds algorithm with a sparsity-dependent regret bound. The analysis extends to partial monitoring scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces new improved regret bounds across various settings.
- It provides a clear comparison with previous work.
- The proposed SPA learning rate is technically sound and may have broader applications beyond the current study.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation is sometimes hard to follow due to the multitude of results.
- The design of SPA appears straightforward, limiting its novelty.
- The analysis of partial monitoring is relegated to the last half page, hindering insights into the main results.
- There are too many in-line equations, which may detract from clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing more context and discussion before diving into analyses. Specifically, it would be beneficial to explain the intuitive significance of $opt\prime_{q_t}(\eta_t)$ in capturing game difficulty. Additionally, we suggest including a comparison of regret bounds with $\Delta_{\min}$ and $L_2$ in Table 1, as this would enhance understanding of the results. Finally, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the implications of the learning rate's dependence on stability and penalty, potentially illustrating what would be lost if it depended solely on one of these factors.
