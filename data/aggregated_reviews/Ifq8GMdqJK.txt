Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new Rao-Blackwellized Predictor Test (RBPT) for conditional independence testing, emphasizing its robustness against model misspecification. The authors propose new approximations and bounds on testing errors due to bias in model-based tests, and they evaluate RBPT against existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in controlling Type-I error rates even under misspecification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and structured, providing substantial theoretical derivation of Type I error rates and power.
- It addresses a significant and underappreciated problem in conditional independence testing, particularly the impact of model misspecification.
- The innovative application of sufficient statistics and the Rao-Blackwell theorem is a notable contribution.
- Empirical evaluations, including simulations and real-data experiments, support the theoretical claims.

Weaknesses:
- The term "model misspecification" is redefined, which may confuse readers; alternative terms like "non-optimal training" could be clearer.
- The experimental validation is limited, relying heavily on a single toy example, which may not adequately demonstrate the method's robustness.
- Important details are relegated to the Appendix, which may hinder practical understanding.
- The paper lacks a thorough analysis of time complexity for the proposed methods compared to alternatives.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the term "model misspecification" by considering alternatives that may resonate better with readers. Additionally, we suggest expanding the empirical validation to include more diverse datasets and real-world applications, similar to those used in STFR. It would also be beneficial to provide detailed explanations of how the CatBoost regressor is adapted for RBPT and to clarify the variables in the real data experiments. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to refine the presentation by consolidating overlapping proofs and reducing technical jargon to enhance reader engagement.
