Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a proactive object detection wrapper, PrObeD, designed to enhance the performance of existing object detectors by generating a custom image-dependent template. The authors demonstrate that this method improves detection in both general object detection (GOD) and camouflaged object detection (COD) tasks. The experiments indicate consistent performance gains across various benchmarks, including COCO and specific COD datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed proactive object detection wrapper is flexible and applicable to various object detectors, including Faster R-CNN, YOLO, and DeTR.
- The method is novel, being the first to apply a proactive approach to object detection tasks, and shows significant improvements over baseline methods.
- Extensive experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Weaknesses:
- The performance gains for advanced object detectors like YOLOv5 and DeTR are marginal, raising questions about the method's effectiveness in these contexts.
- The rationale behind using a simple template generation process and its impact on performance is unclear, particularly for GOD tasks.
- The reported benchmark results for camouflaged object detection differ from those in existing literature, necessitating further validation and comparison.
- Certain experimental details, such as the frameworks used and baseline performance metrics, are inadequately specified.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind the template's design and its benefits for both GOD and COD tasks. Additionally, addressing the marginal performance gains in advanced detectors and providing a more comprehensive comparison with related works would strengthen the paper. We also suggest including more detailed experimental setups and clarifying the computational costs associated with the proposed method. Lastly, enhancing the abstract by defining unconventional terms and ensuring clarity in the presentation would improve readability.
