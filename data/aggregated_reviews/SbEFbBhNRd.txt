### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative approach, FreqBack, for backdoor attacks on time series classification (TSC) models, utilizing frequency domain analysis. The authors demonstrate that existing attacks often target unimportant frequencies, leading to unsatisfactory performance. By identifying and leveraging important frequencies, the proposed method achieves high precision and stealthiness in attacks. The empirical results indicate significant improvements in attack success rates (ASR) while maintaining clean accuracy. However, the paper lacks a comprehensive exploration of defenses tailored to time series models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The frequency domain analysis for backdoor attacks is a novel and impactful approach.
2. The method shows strong empirical performance across multiple datasets and models.
3. The findings address significant security challenges in real-world TSC applications.

Weaknesses:
1. The writing quality needs improvement, with unclear sections and excessive editorializing regarding dataset selection.
2. The description of the proposed method is insufficiently detailed, particularly in connecting core algorithms to key figures.
3. There is a limited discussion on computational efficiency and the generalization of defense mechanisms against the proposed attacks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing, particularly in sections detailing experimental settings and the description of poisoning. A formal definition of a backdoor attack should be included alongside Section 3.1. We suggest providing a more detailed explanation of the trigger generation process and its parameters. Additionally, the authors should justify the selection of datasets included in the results and clarify the exclusion of certain datasets from the main results table. Finally, a clearer discussion of the computational efficiency and scalability of FreqBack compared to other methods would strengthen the paper.
