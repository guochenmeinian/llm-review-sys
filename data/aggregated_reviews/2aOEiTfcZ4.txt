### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into representation collapse in vector quantization (VQ), identifying two main challenges: Tokens Collapse, where a few embeddings dominate token allocation, and Embeddings Collapse, resulting from insufficient encoder parameters. The authors propose effective solutions, including pretraining without VQ followed by fine-tuning with VQ to address Tokens Collapse, and increasing encoder capacity to mitigate Embeddings Collapse. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, such as CIFAR-10, validate the effectiveness of these approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper clearly identifies the causes of tokens and embeddings collapse and offers coherent, well-thought-out solutions.
2. Validation through both synthetic and real-world data enhances the credibility of the proposed solutions.

Weaknesses:
1. The exploration of solutions is somewhat limited; a broader range of alternatives or comparisons with other state-of-the-art techniques would provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
2. The reliance on pretraining without VQ may restrict flexibility; discussing generalization to scenarios where pretraining is not feasible is necessary.
3. Empirical results could benefit from a broader context regarding how these collapses affect various domains, such as NLP and audio processing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by exploring a combined approach to mitigate both Tokens Collapse and Embeddings Collapse, as these issues may occur simultaneously in practical applications. Additionally, a discussion on the computational overheads associated with increasing encoder capacity and the trade-offs between representation quality and computational demands would be valuable. Finally, an analysis of the computational costs when applying both solutions simultaneously would enhance the practical relevance of the paper, aiding practitioners in balancing performance and efficiency.
