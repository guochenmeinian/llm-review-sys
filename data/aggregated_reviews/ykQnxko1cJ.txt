Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CemiFace, a novel diffusion-based method for generating synthetic face images with controlled similarity to identity centers, enhancing face recognition (FR) model performance. The authors argue that semi-hard negative samples, which exhibit moderate similarity to the identity center, are essential for effective training. CemiFace introduces a similarity controlling factor (m) that regulates this similarity during the diffusion process. The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between sample similarity and FR performance, demonstrating that semi-hard samples with m near 0 yield the best accuracy. CemiFace shows significant improvements over existing methods, particularly on pose-sensitive datasets, and offers a promising solution to privacy concerns in face data collection.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Discovery of the importance of similarity control in synthetic face generation, which is a significant contribution to the synthetic dataset generation community.
- Unique integration of a similarity controlling factor (m) within the diffusion process, allowing fine-grained control over generated data distribution.
- Thorough analysis of the impact of different similarity levels on FR performance, validating the hypothesis regarding semi-hard samples.
- Rigorous experimental evaluation across various benchmark datasets, providing insights into the influence of different parameters on model performance.
- Robustness of CemiFace demonstrated through consistent superior results across varying training and inquiry data.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks an in-depth discussion on why certain similarity levels are more beneficial for training FR models, including a comparison of similarity with real datasets.
- Clarity issues regarding the method for determining GtR and the potential reliance on real inquiry images for generating synthetic data.
- Concerns about the reproducibility of the method due to unclear definitions of key functions and parameters.
- The organization of the paper could be improved for better clarity and understanding of contributions and technical details.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by providing a detailed analysis of why specific similarity levels enhance training effectiveness, including comparisons with real datasets. Additionally, clarifying the method for determining GtR and ensuring that the synthetic images remain uncorrelated with real images would strengthen the paper. We suggest including a complete pseudo-code of the proposed method and elaborating on Figure 3 for better comprehension. Addressing the clarity of equations and the role of parameters in the diffusion process will also enhance the paper's overall quality. Finally, reorganizing the manuscript for improved readability and coherence would benefit the audience.
