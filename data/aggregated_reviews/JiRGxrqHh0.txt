Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Federated Agent Cost Truthfulness (FACT), a mechanism designed to address the free-rider dilemma in federated learning. FACT promotes truthful reporting by agents and mitigates free-riding through a penalty system and a competitive environment, encouraging agent participation with improved performance compared to training alone. The empirical results indicate that FACT effectively reduces agent loss and prevents free-riding, even under untruthful conditions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The logical structure of the methodology is clear, effectively utilizing contract theory to prevent free-rider attacks in federated learning.
2. Most proposed theories and definitions are substantiated with proofs.
3. The addressed problem is critical, marking the first study of free-rider attacks in federated learning under active deception conditions.

Weaknesses:
1. Equations 10, 26, and 27 lack punctuation.
2. There are extra blank lines in several locations (lines 447, 452, 459, 475, 485, 496, and 514).
3. The introduction would benefit from a figure illustrating the proposed issues.
4. The experimental section is insufficient to thoroughly validate the effectiveness of the FACT mechanism, particularly regarding the additional communication overhead it introduces.
5. The organization of the experimental results is confusing; presenting overall model accuracy first, followed by ablation studies of various FACT components, would enhance clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including comparative results with other federated learning algorithms to substantiate the effectiveness of FACT. Additionally, clarifying the limitations regarding collusion among parties and addressing the computational overhead compared to traditional federated learning would strengthen the paper. We suggest including accuracy metrics alongside loss to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of model performance. Finally, we encourage the authors to clearly articulate the limitations of their mechanism, particularly regarding server-side incentives and trust issues among clients.
