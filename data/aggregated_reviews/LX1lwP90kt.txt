Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Gaussian Process Switching Linear Dynamical System (gpSLDS), a novel approach for modeling low-dimensional latent dynamics of neuronal populations. The authors propose a Gaussian process with a new Smoothly Switching Linear (SSL) kernel that captures complex nonlinear dynamics while enhancing interpretability. The methodology is validated through experiments on synthetic and real neuroscience data, demonstrating improved performance over traditional methods like rSLDS.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The gpSLDS introduces an innovative kernel function that effectively balances expressiveness and interpretability in analyzing neural dynamics.
- The methodology is well-developed, with a clear exposition and structure that guides the reader through the problem, model formulation, and experimental results.
- The paper provides convincing experimental results, including real data from animal experiments, and offers code for reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a comprehensive analysis of computational trade-offs between different methods, making it difficult to assess their relative performance.
- There is insufficient discussion of the limitations of the gpSLDS, particularly regarding scenarios where the model may underperform.
- Some presentation aspects could be improved, and further complexity analysis is needed, especially for long sequences.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of computational trade-offs by comparing gpSLDS with GP-RBF and rSLDS in terms of predictive performance relative to training time and budget. Additionally, consider adding another baseline method, such as LFADS, to strengthen the comparative analysis. A dedicated limitations section should be included to discuss specific scenarios where the model may fail or underperform. Finally, enhancing the clarity of certain figures and addressing minor presentation issues would further improve the paper's quality.
