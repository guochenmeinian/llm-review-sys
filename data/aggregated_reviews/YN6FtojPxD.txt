### Key Points
This paper presents an evaluation of the performance of large language models (LLMs) in machine translation (MT) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) across diverse dialects, focusing on correlations with socio-economic and linguistic metrics. The authors quantify performance disparities between major and minor dialects, revealing that linguistic similarity to well-resourced varieties significantly influences model performance, often more so than socio-economic factors. The study highlights the challenges of linguistic diversity in NLP and suggests pathways for enhancing dialectal NLP.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of dialectal performance in MT and ASR, addressing an important topic in NLP.
- The findings are relevant and have significant implications for future research in dialectal NLP.
- The experimental design is well-argued, and the paper is clearly written and organized.

Weaknesses:
- The paper does not significantly extend the understanding of the dialect gap beyond existing literature and lacks novel resources.
- The causal analysis section requires a more formalized statistical plan, as it primarily evaluates correlations without establishing direct causation.
- The title is misleading, as the paper focuses on correlations rather than causal relationships.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the formalization of the statistical analysis plan in the causal analysis section to justify the use of "causes across languages" in the title. Additionally, consider narrowing the focus to a smaller set of factors for a more thorough examination rather than covering a broad range superficially. We also suggest that the authors clarify the unexpected correlations and negative findings mentioned in the text, providing deeper analysis to enhance understanding. Finally, a more extensive literature review, particularly referencing existing works on dialects, would strengthen the contextualization of the study.
