### Key Points
This paper analyzes 3-way interactions for nouns in Mandarin Chinese, focusing on frequency, similarity, and co-occurrence with nominal classifiers. The authors propose that the classifier system reduces entropy for upcoming nouns, similar to gender systems in other languages. They find that high-similarity, low-frequency nouns share classifiers more often than high-frequency nouns, while low-similarity nouns exhibit the opposite trend. The study utilizes a corpus of 1M Mandarin sentences and employs fastText embeddings for similarity comparisons.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper presents a theoretically motivating analogy between nominal classifiers and gender systems, contributing to the understanding of communicative efficiency in language.  
- It provides a novel finding regarding the interaction between frequency and noun similarity, which is well-supported by empirical data.

Weaknesses:  
- The rationale for including various metrics (frequency, cosine similarity, co-occurrence) is unclear, and their interrelations may complicate result interpretation.  
- The methodology raises questions, such as the downsampling of unique nouns and the choice of similarity measures, which could affect the robustness of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their rationale for the chosen metrics and explore the implications of their interrelations on the results. Additionally, we suggest that the authors consider analyzing "count" and "mass" classifiers separately to enhance the scope of their findings. It would also be beneficial to train novel embeddings on the corpus with classifiers erased to mitigate potential biases in the similarity measures. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide clearer explanations for key concepts such as "communicative pressure" and to ensure consistency in terminology throughout the paper.
