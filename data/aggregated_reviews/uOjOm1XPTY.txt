### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of the impact of inference acceleration techniques on demographic biases in large language models (LLMs). The authors conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation across multiple metrics, revealing that these acceleration methods can significantly influence bias. The findings underscore the necessity for careful evaluation of models post-optimization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses an important and potentially overlooked issue regarding the relationship between efficient inference techniques and bias in LLMs.  
- It is well-written and easy to follow.  
- The evaluation is thorough, encompassing various inference techniques and dimensions of bias.  

Weaknesses:  
- The discussion on the characteristics of various state-of-the-art LLMs and specific inference acceleration strategies is limited, which is essential for understanding performance across bias metrics.  
- Sampling output only five times for non-greedy decoding may not adequately assess model robustness; a larger sample size is recommended for greater confidence in results.  
- The paper lacks a systematic qualitative and quantitative analysis of the reasons behind varying bias tendencies with different acceleration strategies, weakening the conclusions.  
- The evaluated LLMs are limited to LLaMA and Mistral models; incorporating a different style of model could enhance generalizability.  
- There is no proposed solution; a discussion of potential solutions or future directions based on findings would improve the work.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the characteristics of various LLMs and the specific inference acceleration strategies employed to enhance understanding of their performance. Increasing the sample size for output evaluation would provide more robust results. Additionally, a systematic analysis of the underlying reasons for bias variations with different acceleration strategies is necessary to strengthen the conclusions. Incorporating a broader range of LLMs would enhance the generalizability of the findings. Finally, we suggest adding a paragraph discussing potential solutions or future research directions based on the analysis results.
