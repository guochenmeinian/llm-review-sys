Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SureMap, a novel method for disaggregated evaluation aimed at improving performance estimation accuracy for machine learning models across various subpopulations. The authors propose transforming the problem into structured simultaneous Gaussian mean estimation, utilizing maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation and Steinâ€™s unbiased risk estimate (SURE) for parameter tuning. SureMap is evaluated across multiple domains, including automated speech recognition (ASR) and tabular census data, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods in both single-task and multi-task settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of SureMap addresses a critical issue in fairness and evaluation of AI systems, particularly in small subpopulations.
2. The method shows strong empirical results, outperforming previous estimation approaches by up to 50% across various datasets.
3. The paper is well-structured, with a clear theoretical foundation and comprehensive experiments, enhancing its clarity and significance.

Weaknesses:
1. The Gaussian assumption may lead to underperformance in heavy-tailed data scenarios, and the method's efficiency discussion requires expansion.
2. The practical implementation of SureMap may be complex, particularly regarding the coordinate descent algorithm for parameter tuning.
3. There is a lack of comparison to recent methods, such as GP-based approaches, and the scalability of SureMap in large-scale settings is not fully explored.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the efficiency discussion by detailing the complexity of SureMap compared to existing methods and reporting actual runtime. Additionally, the authors should analyze cases where SureMap performs worse than pooled estimation and clarify the pooled estimator notation in Equation 3. It would also be beneficial to explore non-Gaussian models, such as t-distributions, to better handle heavy-tailed performance data. Finally, providing more detailed pseudocode for the coordinate descent algorithm and examples of real-world applications would enhance the practical utility of SureMap.
