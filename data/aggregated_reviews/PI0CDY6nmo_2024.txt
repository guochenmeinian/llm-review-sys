Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on stochastic combinatorial semi-bandit problems, focusing on algorithms that adapt to covariance structures to optimize regret bounds. The authors propose two algorithms, OLS-UCB-C and COS-V, which utilize online covariance estimation. COS-V is noted for its computational efficiency and achieves a $T^{0.5}$ gap-free regret bound, marking a significant advancement in the field. The paper also discusses theoretical results, including gap-free variance-dependent upper bounds and corresponding lower bounds.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and presents new algorithms that enhance computational efficiency and regret bounds by adapting to covariance structures.  
- It provides the first gap-free regret bounds for combinatorial semi-bandits, extending the theoretical framework beyond independent rewards.  
- The comparison of regret rates and computational complexity among algorithms is clear.  

Weaknesses:  
- The log(T) term in the regret bound has a power of 3, which could be improved.  
- The online covariance matrix estimation approach is not novel.  
- There is a lack of empirical evaluation, which is a significant gap in the study.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the assumptions regarding the boundedness of rewards, as the current assumption may be too strong. Additionally, we suggest conducting empirical evaluations to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms against competitors. It would also be beneficial to provide a detailed justification for the design choices of the functions `f_t,δ` and `g_t,δ`, particularly regarding their increasing nature over time. Lastly, including error bars in future experiments would enhance the robustness of the results presented.
