Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Self-Healing Machine Learning (SHML) framework, which addresses performance degradation in machine learning models by autonomously diagnosing the causes and suggesting corrective actions. Unlike traditional methods, SHML focuses on understanding the reasons for model degradation through a structured pipeline that includes monitoring, diagnosis, adaptation, and testing. The authors formalize SHML as an optimization problem and introduce an algorithm (H-LLM) that utilizes large language models for diagnosis and adaptation, supported by empirical evaluations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The SHML framework offers a novel approach by diagnosing and addressing root causes of model degradation rather than relying on reason-agnostic methods.
2. The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation and demonstrates practical viability through empirical evaluations.
3. The organization and clarity of the paper are commendable, with well-structured explanations and effective use of figures and tables.

Weaknesses:
1. The empirical evaluation is limited to a simulated diabetes prediction task; broader experiments in diverse real-world environments are needed.
2. The comparison with existing concept drift adaptation methods lacks comprehensiveness, requiring a wider set of baseline comparisons.
3. The implementation details of H-LLM are insufficiently addressed, particularly regarding real-world deployment challenges.
4. The writing in some sections, particularly section 3, is convoluted, affecting readability and clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical evaluation by including a wider range of real-world environments beyond the simulated diabetes prediction task. Additionally, a more exhaustive comparison with existing concept drift adaptation methods would clarify SHML's advantages and limitations. We suggest providing detailed information on the implementation of H-LLM to address practical deployment challenges. Furthermore, enhancing the clarity of complex sections and ensuring that critical details are not relegated to the appendix would strengthen the paper's impact.
