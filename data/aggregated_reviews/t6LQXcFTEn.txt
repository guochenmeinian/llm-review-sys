Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents AudioMarkBench, a benchmark framework for evaluating the robustness of three state-of-the-art audio watermarking methods against 15 types of perturbations in no-box, white-box, and black-box settings. It introduces a new dataset, AudioMarkData, that encompasses various languages, genders, and age groups for evaluation. The findings reveal significant limitations in current audio watermarking techniques and highlight vulnerabilities and fairness issues across different demographic attributes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper conducts extensive experiments and provides a comprehensive evaluation of audio watermarking methods against various watermark-removal and forgery perturbations.
2. The introduction of AudioMarkData offers a valuable resource for future research in audio watermarking.
3. The evaluation uncovers vulnerabilities in current techniques and identifies fairness issues, emphasizing the need for more robust and fairness-aware methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The evaluation is limited to only three audio watermarking methods; a broader range should be considered for a more comprehensive assessment.
2. The dataset lacks diversity in language and age groups, which could affect the generalizability of the findings.
3. The observed disparity in robustness between genders raises questions about potential causes, which are not adequately addressed in the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including a wider range of audio watermarking methods and considering additional potential attacks to enhance the benchmark's applicability. The authors should also expand the dataset to include a more diverse representation of languages and age groups. Furthermore, we suggest providing insights into the causes of the fairness gap observed between genders and exploring the impact of audio inherent properties on watermarking effectiveness. Lastly, clarifying the evaluation of no-box, black-box, and white-box attacks, as well as detailing the augmentation used for adversarial training, would strengthen the paper.
