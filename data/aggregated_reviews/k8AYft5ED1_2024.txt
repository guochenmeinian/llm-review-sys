Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into Adversarial Collaborative Filtering (ACF) within recommender systems, emphasizing its efficacy and robustness against data poisoning attacks. The authors propose a novel method, PamaCF, that dynamically assigns perturbation magnitudes based on user embedding scales, supported by theoretical analyses and extensive experiments across various collaborative filtering (CF) backbones and attack methods. The findings suggest that ACF not only enhances robustness but also improves recommendation performance. The paper has received positive feedback from reviewers, recognizing its contributions to an important research problem, the introduction of a novel idea, sound theoretical results, rigorous mathematical proofs, and solid experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work addresses a significant issue in recommender systems—robustness against attacks—by providing novel theoretical insights into ACF's advantages over traditional CF.
- The authors offer rigorous mathematical proofs and extensive experimental evaluations, utilizing multiple datasets and various attack methods to validate their claims.
- The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations of theoretical concepts and methodologies, supplemented by effective use of figures and tables.
- It introduces an interesting and novel idea with reasonable motivation and sound theoretical results.
- The experimental evaluations are solid and convincing.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical analysis is limited to a dot-product-based loss function, which may not extend well to practical multi-item scenarios.
- The experiments are conducted using only two CF backbones (MF and LightGCN), which may weaken the generalizability of the results.
- There are concerns regarding the impractical assumptions made in the theoretical analysis, particularly regarding embedding initialization and loss functions that do not align with common practices in existing recommender systems.
- The presentation of experimental results is limited due to space constraints, focusing only on the most common choice of top \( k = 20 \).

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical framework by addressing the limitations of Corollary 1 and exploring extensions to multi-item scenarios. Additionally, incorporating more CF methods in the experimental evaluations would enhance the robustness of the findings. We also suggest providing more intuitive explanations for the theoretical results and ensuring that the experimental setup aligns with practical implementations, particularly regarding initialization and loss functions. Furthermore, we recommend improving the presentation of additional experimental results by including them in the Appendix of subsequent versions, as mentioned during the rebuttal period, to enhance clarity and provide a more comprehensive view of the findings. Finally, including results for various values of \( k \) in the evaluation metrics would provide a more comprehensive understanding of ACF's performance across different scenarios.
