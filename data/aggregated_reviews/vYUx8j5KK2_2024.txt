Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Cufit, a curriculum fine-tuning method aimed at enhancing medical image classification performance in the presence of noisy labels. The authors demonstrate that Cufit outperforms existing baselines across various medical datasets and also provides results on a non-medical dataset. The approach leverages linear probing for robustness against label noise and employs a clean sample selection strategy to improve classification accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Cufit demonstrates superior performance compared to other evaluated baselines.
2. The method is agnostic to model types (CNNs and ViTs) and applicable to both medical and natural images.
3. Cufit does not necessitate knowledge of certain hyperparameters required by other methods.
4. The authors have included results on non-medical images, broadening the method's applicability.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper suffers from poor writing quality, with numerous spelling and grammatical errors that hinder clarity.
2. There is a lack of detailed explanation regarding the Cufit algorithm; Section 6.1 fails to adequately describe how Cufit operates.
3. Previous work on PEFT in medical image analysis is not sufficiently cited, missing critical references.
4. The evaluation lacks a description of baseline methods, making it difficult for readers unfamiliar with these methods to understand Cufit’s distinctions.
5. The experiments should include the CheXPert dataset to assess Cufit’s performance in multi-label classification under noisy labels.
6. More datasets and PEFT methods, such as LoRA, should be incorporated to enhance the experiments.
7. The choice of the CIFAR dataset for natural image classification is questioned; more appropriate datasets should be considered.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the writing quality by thoroughly proofreading the manuscript to eliminate spelling and grammatical errors. Additionally, we suggest including a dedicated section that clearly explains the Cufit algorithm and its operational mechanics. It is crucial to cite relevant previous work on PEFT in medical image analysis and to provide definitions for baseline methods used in the evaluation. We also encourage the authors to include the CheXPert dataset in their experiments and to expand the range of datasets and PEFT methods, particularly LoRA, to strengthen their findings. Lastly, we advise reconsidering the use of the CIFAR dataset in favor of more suitable alternatives for natural image classification.
