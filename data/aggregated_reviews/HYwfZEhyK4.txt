Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a graph-based learnable multi-agent framework for visual geo-localization, termed smileGeo. The framework operates in multiple stages: Forwarding, Election (K: Answer agents; R: Reviewer), Review, and Discussion until a conclusion is reached. It introduces a dynamic learning strategy to optimize graph connections and proposes a new GeoGlobe dataset for evaluation. The authors claim that smileGeo outperforms existing single LVLMs and image retrieval methods through collaborative learning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The learnable graph-based communication strategy demonstrates empirical effectiveness, achieving better accuracy with lower average token costs.
- The method is scalable, as evidenced by performance metrics.
- The use of attention-based GNN for optimal connections and elections is well-justified.
- The framework's ability to search the internet enhances performance.

Weaknesses:
- Comparisons with baseline methods appear unfair, lacking clarity on evaluation setups and metrics.
- The geo-localization setting should be more clearly defined, particularly regarding its focus on worldwide city-level geo-localization.
- Limited applicability beyond landmark images and insufficient discussion of practical applications.
- The framework's reliance on closed-source LLMs raises cost-effectiveness concerns.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the geo-localization setting in the introduction to avoid confusion. Additionally, a direct comparison with worldwide geo-localization methods on a city-level setting would strengthen the paper's claims. The authors should also provide more qualitative results to illustrate the framework's performance and consider utilizing existing worldwide geo-localization datasets for comprehensive evaluation. Finally, addressing the framework's limitations and practical applications more thoroughly, particularly in real-time scenarios, would enhance its relevance.
