### Key Points
This paper presents a statistical survey of mentions of moral concepts in 92 research papers published from 2006 to 2023, proposing a summary of these concepts based on ancient and contemporary philosophy. The authors classify the papers into 13 categories and report a predominance of moral psychology concepts over moral philosophy concepts, alongside issues such as a bias towards English language processing and flaws in terminology definitions. The authors also recommend that researchers integrate fundamental moral philosophies, identify these concepts explicitly, and adhere to standard meanings to avoid confusion.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a comprehensive overview of NLP papers addressing morality and ties them to philosophical concepts, which has not been previously done.
- It raises important issues regarding the inconsistent use of moral terminology in NLP literature and highlights the lack of diversity in current studies.
- The recommendations are grounded in quantitative analysis.

Weaknesses:
- The number of surveyed papers is relatively low, which may limit the findings' generalizability.
- The survey may not adequately address the "missing context" problem, focusing primarily on word presence rather than broader contextual understanding.
- The framing of the paper may not effectively convey the bigger picture, making it difficult for readers to grasp key differences in terminology.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of terminology definitions and their implementation in future work, particularly by addressing how to achieve consistency in real-life applications. Additionally, we suggest reframing the presentation of results to provide a clearer overview of the bigger picture, possibly by first defining terms and then supporting these definitions with examples of correct and incorrect usage. Finally, we encourage the authors to consider a broader range of related terms, such as norms and beliefs, to enhance the comprehensiveness of their analysis.
