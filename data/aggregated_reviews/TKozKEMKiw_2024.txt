Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to constructing decision trees by framing the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The authors propose various test generation functions that balance search space coverage and size, applying dynamic programming to solve the MDP. Their method aims to create binary trees that minimize loss while maintaining interpretability through smaller tree sizes. The authors evaluate their approach against established methods like Quant-BnB and MurTree, although the novelty of the approach is questioned due to prior explorations of reinforcement learning in this domain.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and organized, making the methodology easy to understand.
- It addresses an important research direction, particularly in scaling decision tree construction for larger datasets.
- The experiments are thorough, utilizing appropriate baselines and a diverse range of datasets.
- The code and implementations of baselines are fully provided.

Weaknesses:
- The approach lacks sufficient novelty, as the construction of MDPs for decision trees is not new, and the reliance on Classification and Regression Trees (CART) for splitting criteria diminishes originality.
- The evaluated scenarios are not clearly articulated, and the algorithm has not been tested against well-known benchmarks, complicating performance assessment.
- The advantages of the proposed method over CART are not convincingly demonstrated, as both control tree size and depth, with CART being faster and simpler.
- The definition of actions generated by the tree is ambiguous, lacking clarity on whether they are discrete or continuous.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their approach by exploring more distinct test generation functions and clearly articulating the advantages of their method over CART. It is essential to conduct evaluations against well-known benchmarks to substantiate claims of performance and robustness. Additionally, clarifying the definition of actions generated by the tree and providing empirical validation on general reinforcement learning tasks would enhance the paper's contributions. Finally, addressing the interpretability of the trees produced, rather than just their complexity, is crucial for justifying the relevance of the proposed method.
