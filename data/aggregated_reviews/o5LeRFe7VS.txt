### Key Points
This paper presents a test-time augmentation (TTA) method aimed at addressing the variability in model outputs due to small changes in prompts within the factual probing task. The authors propose augmentations such as synonym substitution, back-translation, and stop word filtering to enhance model calibration and reduce sensitivity to prompt variations. They evaluate several pretrained language models, noting that TTA yields more significant benefits for smaller models and improves overall calibration.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem of prompt-induced variability in model outputs is significant and well-addressed.
- TTA is an interesting and generalizable method to enhance prompt effectiveness without requiring training.
- Experiments demonstrate improved model confidence and calibration, particularly for smaller language models.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the proposed augmentation method is questionable, as similar techniques have been previously reported.
- The introduction lacks critical details regarding configuration and results, hindering a full understanding of the methodology and performance.
- Larger models show diminishing returns from TTA, which raises concerns about the method's adaptability to these models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the configuration and results sections to enhance understanding of their methodology. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed explanation of the relationship between prompt variations and model outputs, particularly how TTA addresses this issue. It would also be beneficial to clarify the differences between their approach and existing methods, such as the one proposed in "Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought Reasoning in Language Models." Lastly, addressing the diminishing improvements observed in larger models could strengthen the paper's contributions.
