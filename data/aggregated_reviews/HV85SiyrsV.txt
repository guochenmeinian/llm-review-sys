Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an algorithm that learns an $\epsilon$-optimal policy with polynomial sample complexity through online interactions with a $q^\pi$-realizable MDP, addressing a significant open question in reinforcement learning. The authors demonstrate that $q^\pi$-realizability allows for the partitioning of states into those with small range and those that can be approximated by a linear MDP. The proposed SKIPPYELEANOR algorithm effectively distinguishes between these states while learning. Notably, the paper reveals that linear $q^\pi$ MDPs are more general than linear MDPs, as they can include states with low range that do not affect optimal policy learning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a novel solution to a long-standing question in reinforcement learning, demonstrating that $q^\pi$-realizable MDPs can be learned with polynomial samples.
- The identification of the relationship between $q^\pi$-realizability and linear MDPs is a significant conceptual advancement.
- The mathematical exposition is clear and structured, facilitating understanding of the core contributions.

Weaknesses:
- The algorithm's computational inefficiency is inadequately discussed, particularly regarding Optimization Problem 4.10, which should be addressed in a Limitations section.
- The presentation suffers from cluttered notation and deep definition dependencies, making it difficult to follow. The technical sections are overly complex, which detracts from the clarity of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the algorithm's computational inefficiency, specifically addressing the challenges posed by Optimization Problem 4.10 in a dedicated Limitations section. Additionally, we suggest simplifying the notation and reducing the complexity of definitions to enhance readability. Consider providing high-level explanations of key components and design choices within the main text, while relegating detailed technicalities to the appendix. Finally, including a Conclusion section and a comparative analysis in tabular form would strengthen the overall presentation and contextual understanding of the work.
