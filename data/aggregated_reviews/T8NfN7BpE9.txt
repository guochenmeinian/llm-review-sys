### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the use of client-side resources, particularly JavaScript libraries, in phishing websites compared to legitimate target websites. The analysis is based on a dataset of 7.1 million phishing URLs collected over 25 months, revealing that phishing sites utilize a more diverse range of JavaScript libraries, including some exclusive to phishing, such as Socket.IO. Additionally, it notes that phishing websites often employ older versions of these libraries, raising questions about their update practices.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper conducts a longitudinal study with extensive data collection, providing valuable insights into the characteristics of client-side JavaScript usage in phishing sites.
- It introduces novel findings regarding the diversity of JavaScript libraries and the methods used for analysis, such as phishing page clustering and HTML similarity matching.
- The dataset will be shared with the research community, promoting further research.

Weaknesses:
- The paper overclaims the dataset size, as only about 3 million phishing sites were effectively analyzed due to accessibility issues.
- There is a lack of clarity on how findings can be translated into actionable defense insights against phishing.
- The analysis does not sufficiently explore the source code used by phishers or the implications of using outdated libraries.
- The technical analysis is limited in scope, particularly regarding other client-side resources and the treatment of bundled libraries.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity in the abstract and introduction regarding the actual number of phishing sites analyzed to avoid misleading claims. Additionally, the authors should analyze phishing pages that handle 2FA to provide a more comprehensive understanding of their tactics. We suggest including a discussion on the implications of using older JavaScript libraries and how these findings can inform phishing detection strategies. Furthermore, a deeper analysis of the overlap between phishing and legitimate websites, including quantitative assessments, would enhance the paper's contributions. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify their recommendations for CDN providers regarding suspicious URLs to ensure practical applicability.
