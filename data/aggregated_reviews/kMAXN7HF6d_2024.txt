### Key Points
This paper presents a study of the online bipartite matching problem with a focus on class fairness, proposing the first randomized non-wasteful algorithm that guarantees $1/2$-approximate class envy-freeness (CEF), $1/2$-approximate class proportionality (CPROP), and $1/2$-approximate utilitarian social welfare (USW). The authors demonstrate that no randomized non-wasteful algorithm can achieve $\alpha$-CEF with $\alpha > 0.761$, and in the divisible case, no deterministic algorithm can exceed $0.67$-CEF. Additionally, the paper introduces the "price of fairness," illustrating the trade-off between fairness and efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a well-motivated problem and is well-structured and written.  
- It resolves a long-standing conjecture by developing a non-wasteful randomized algorithm that achieves non-trivial fairness guarantees.  
- The analysis of the algorithm and the introduction of the price of fairness are significant contributions, providing insights into the trade-offs between fairness and efficiency.  

Weaknesses:  
- The positive algorithmic contribution is limited, primarily relying on random allocation without clear improvements over prior work.  
- The relationship to existing literature, particularly regarding the novelty of the contributions, is not clearly articulated.  
- The paper lacks experimental results to demonstrate the algorithm's performance, and certain references are outdated or missing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the relationship between their work and prior studies, particularly "Class Fairness in Online Matching," to better highlight the novel contributions. Additionally, we suggest including experimental results to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Addressing minor issues, such as typos and unclear descriptions in the text, would enhance the overall quality of the paper. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide a more detailed discussion on the significance of the $1/2$-CEF guarantee in comparison to existing results.
