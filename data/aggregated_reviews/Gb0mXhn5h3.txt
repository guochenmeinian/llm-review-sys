### Key Points
This paper presents MiSO (Microstimulation Optimization), a closed-loop framework aimed at optimizing stimulation parameters to drive neural activity towards target states. The authors propose two main contributions: the use of latent space alignment to concatenate data across recording days, and the application of various neural network architectures, including CNNs, to predict the effects of stimulation patterns. The framework addresses the challenge of a large search space by leveraging these methods to enhance the effectiveness of brain stimulation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The manuscript is well-written and addresses a significant challenge in brain-computer interfaces (BCI) by guiding neural activity towards target states using a large number of stimulation patterns.
- The use of latent space alignment is an innovative approach that allows for the integration of data across different days, which is crucial for real-world applications.
- The experimental evaluation on a primate subject adds credibility to the proposed approach.

Weaknesses:
- The stimulation parameters' search space is not well-defined, and the modality for measuring brain responses is unspecified, leading to potential challenges.
- The limitations of the proposed method are weakly addressed, with insufficient clarity on scenarios where it may fail or the implications of the large number of stimulation configurations.
- The integration of CNNs into the closed-loop system is not fully realized, as the current setup relies on an epsilon-greedy algorithm rather than fully utilizing CNN predictions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the stimulation parameters' search space and specify the modality used for measuring brain responses. Additionally, the authors should address the limitations more thoroughly, particularly regarding the scenarios in which the method may fail and the implications of the large number of stimulation configurations. We suggest integrating the CNN more fully into the closed-loop system to enhance its predictive capabilities. Furthermore, providing examples of neural target patterns and discussing the challenges of scaling the approach to a higher number of electrodes would strengthen the manuscript. Lastly, the authors should consider exploring alternative latent space alignment methods and provide a broader outlook on the potential applications of their work beyond the current experimental context.
