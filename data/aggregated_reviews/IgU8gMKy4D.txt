Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to contrastive dimension reduction (CDR), focusing on determining whether unique submanifolds exist in foreground data compared to background data. The authors propose a hypothesis testing method to assess the existence of contrastive dimensions and an estimator for the number of contrastive principal components (PCs). The theoretical aspects of the estimator, including consistency and finite sample error bounds, are explored, supported by synthetic and real data analyses.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The manuscript introduces a hypothesis testing framework and an estimator for the number of PCs, contributing significantly to the CDR literature.
- It provides a mathematically rigorous formulation to quantify unique information in foreground data.
- The theoretical proof of consistency and error bounds for the estimator is well-articulated.
- Extensive real data analysis enhances the manuscript's credibility and applicability.
- The writing is clear and the organization is effective.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed hypothesis test lacks surprising elements and may not be justified adequately, particularly regarding the assumptions made.
- There is a discrepancy between p-values from permutation tests and the estimator, suggesting a need for further investigation.
- The simulation study appears simplistic and lacks repetitive iterations to assess stability.
- The practical implications of the proposed methods for downstream tasks are insufficiently discussed.
- Terminology used may be misleading, and the title does not accurately reflect the paper's focus.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification of the assumptions underlying the hypothesis test, particularly regarding $V_x \subset V_y$ under $H_0$. Additionally, conducting more extensive simulations with repeated iterations would enhance the robustness of the findings. Clarifying the practical applications of the proposed methods in selecting hyperparameters for downstream tasks is essential. We also suggest revising the terminology to avoid potential misinterpretations and reconsidering the title to better reflect the content. Finally, addressing the questions raised about the formulation's practicality and the necessity of the hypothesis test would strengthen the manuscript.
