### Key Points
This paper presents a study of sequential procurement auctions utilizing best and final offer (BAFO) strategies, where a buyer sequentially approaches sellers who can fix their prices. The authors demonstrate that these auctions can achieve efficient outcomes across various buyer valuation functions, although the final prices are influenced by the order of seller engagement. The analysis includes both sequential name-your-BAFO and descending BAFO auctions, characterizing subgame perfect equilibria to ensure no buyer can improve their utility through deviation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is mostly clear and engaging, with a well-motivated focus on non-substitutable goods.
- The theoretical results appear novel and contribute to the understanding of BAFO auctions.
- The related work section is brief yet comprehensive.

Weaknesses:
- The relevance of the paper to the Web Conference is questionable, as it lacks direct applications to advertising or online markets.
- Practical implications for buyers and sellers in adopting BAFO strategies are not clearly articulated.
- The paper contains numerous typos and lacks clarity in defining key concepts and auction settings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the relevance of the paper to the Web Conference by explicitly connecting the findings to online auction mechanisms or advertising contexts. Additionally, the authors should clarify the practical implications of BAFO strategies for both buyers and sellers, potentially including comparisons with other auction types. To enhance clarity, we suggest defining "BAFO" formally, providing a clear primer on the auction setting, and including a table of variables in the preliminaries. Addressing the identified typos and ensuring a coherent conclusion or summary of key takeaways would also strengthen the paper.
