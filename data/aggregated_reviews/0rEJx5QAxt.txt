Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents policy gradient methods utilizing stochastic gradient estimates from play trajectories to compute polynomial-time Stackelberg equilibria in convex-concave games, particularly in reach-avoid scenarios. The authors demonstrate through experiments the advantages of Stackelberg equilibria over simultaneous-move counterparts in these problems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper extends prior work by Goktas and Greenwald, filling a theoretical gap by providing polynomial-time guarantees with stochastic gradient estimates.
- It effectively motivates the problem and showcases practical applications, particularly in Section 5, which highlights the benefits of Stackelberg equilibria.
- The writing is clear, and the results are well-contextualized within existing literature.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution may be seen as incremental compared to prior works, particularly regarding the techniques used to transition from exact to stochastic gradient information.
- The clarity of the contribution section is lacking, and comparisons with recent first-order methods for Stackelberg games are absent.
- Several critical assumptions, such as the convexity and concavity of functions, raise questions about their practical feasibility and validation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the contribution section and include comparisons with recent works on first-order methods for Stackelberg games. Additionally, addressing the feasibility of the assumptions made, particularly regarding the concavity of action correspondences, would strengthen the paper. It would also be beneficial to expand the numerical setup and clarify the MDP framework, ensuring that the decision-making process of the leader and follower is well-defined. Lastly, we suggest introducing the notion of stochastic convexity, as it is quite non-standard and relevant to the discussion.
