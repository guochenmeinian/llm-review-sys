Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Domain-Aware Adapter (DA-Ada) designed for domain adaptive object detection (DAOD) using visual-language models (VLMs). DA-Ada comprises two main components: the Domain-Invariant Adapter (DIA), which learns domain-invariant features, and the Domain-Specific Adapter (DSA), which captures domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, a Visual-guided Textual Adapter (VTA) integrates cross-domain information into the textual encoder. Experimental results demonstrate that DA-Ada significantly outperforms existing methods across various DAOD benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method achieves substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art approaches.
2. The motivation for learning domain-specific features to enhance cross-domain performance is clearly articulated.
3. The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with comprehensive ablation studies supporting the findings.

Weaknesses:
1. Some claims lack sufficient justification, particularly regarding the effectiveness of low-dimensional features for domain adaptation.
2. Certain designs appear similar to existing works, raising questions about their novelty.
3. The method's applicability to more advanced detectors remains untested.
4. The writing and organization of the paper require refinement for clarity and coherence.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for claims regarding low-dimensional features and their relationship to domain invariance. Clarifying the differences between the Visual-guided Textual Adapter and existing techniques like CoCoop is essential. Additionally, providing evidence for the assumptions made about the domain-specific adapter's use of residual visual features would strengthen the paper. We suggest exploring the method's adaptability to advanced detectors such as DETR and CenterNet v2. Furthermore, enhancing the paper's organization, particularly in aligning method descriptions with figures, will improve readability. Lastly, including comparisons of computational speed and visualizations for failure cases would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method.
