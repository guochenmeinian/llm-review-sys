Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Exploratory Retrieval-Augmented Planning (ExRAP) framework, addressing the challenge of continual instruction following in dynamic environments. ExRAP integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with a temporal embodied knowledge graph (TEKG) to maintain environmental context and enhance planning efficiency. The framework employs a memory-augmented query evaluator and an exploration-integrated task planner, which balances exploration and exploitation to optimize task execution. Experiments demonstrate ExRAP's superior performance in integrated planning across various environments, although the scalability and applicability to real-world scenarios remain uncertain.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is among the first to address conditional embodied planning in dynamic environments.
- ExRAP effectively produces more efficient plans than baseline models, adapting to environmental changes through continual exploration.

Weaknesses:
- The method's reliance on in-context learning limits scalability, and an ablation study on the retrieval dataset size is needed to assess performance with larger contexts.
- While effective for simple parallel instructions, the framework's performance on long-term tasks requiring multiple steps is unclear, raising concerns about computational overhead.
- The applicability to real-world settings is questionable, particularly regarding scalability with increasing object numbers.
- The term "continual embodied instruction following" may be misleading, as instructions are provided simultaneously rather than requiring dynamic replanning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the term "continual embodied instruction following" by considering a more accurate description, such as "conditional embodied instruction following in dynamic environments." Additionally, conducting an ablation study on the size of the retrieval dataset would help demonstrate the method's scalability. It would also be beneficial to investigate the framework's performance on complex, long-term tasks and address the potential computational overhead associated with increased queries. Lastly, a discussion on the applicability of ExRAP in real-world scenarios, particularly regarding object scalability, should be included to strengthen the paper's contributions.
