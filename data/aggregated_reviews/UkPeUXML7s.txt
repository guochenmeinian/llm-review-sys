Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the approximate heavy-tailed behavior of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in local minima under practical conditions, demonstrating that the stationary distribution of offline SGD exhibits an approximate power-law distribution. The approximation error is linked to the convergence rate of the empirical distribution to the true data distribution in the Wasserstein metric. The authors contribute by proving nonasymptotic Wasserstein convergence bounds for offline to online SGD as data points increase, supported by experimental validation. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- **Originality**: The paper addresses the heavy-tailed behavior of SGD in finite data settings, providing a nonasymptotic Wasserstein convergence bound that connects offline and online SGD.
- **Quality**: Rigorous theoretical analysis and experimental verification bolster the claims made.
- **Clarity**: The writing is clear, with well-explained technical terms and helpful schematic illustrations.
- **Significance**: The findings have both theoretical and practical implications, with explicit bounds on the distance from a true heavy-tailed distribution.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks an evaluation method for estimating tail indices, particularly in relation to the step size $\eta$, batch size $b$, and their ratio $\eta/b$. Providing such a method would strengthen the work.
- The dependence of tail indices on the ratio $\eta/b$ is questioned, as previous literature suggests a modification that is linear in $b$. The authors should clarify this discrepancy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by providing an evaluation method for the estimated tail indices, even if approximate. Additionally, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the relationship between the tail indices predicted by their theorem and the explicit expressions found in the literature, particularly in light of the findings in Sec. 6.6 of Ref.[1]. Furthermore, including numerical results that quantify the difference between the experimental tail and a true power-law tail would enhance the paper's impact.
