Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies the hypothesis selection problem, aiming to select a distribution \( H_i \) from a set of candidate distributions \( \mathcal{H} \) such that \( ||H_i - P||_{TV} \leq \alpha \cdot \mathsf{OPT} + \epsilon \). The authors propose two algorithms: the first achieves an optimal approximation factor \( \alpha = 3 \) with a running time of \( \tilde{O}(n \cdot s / \epsilon) \), while the second achieves \( \alpha = 4 \) with a running time of \( \tilde{O}(n \cdot s) \). The paper emphasizes the algorithmic techniques involved and presents a clear overview of the first algorithm's structure.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper makes significant progress on a fundamental problem in hypothesis selection, introducing novel algorithms with improved runtime.
- The algorithms utilize clever ideas and new concepts, which may have future applications.
- The writing is generally clear, particularly in the proof overview, making the methods accessible to readers.

Weaknesses:
- The writing lacks polish and could benefit from clearer exposition, particularly regarding complex concepts like "semi-distances."
- The dependence of the first algorithm's complexity on learning parameters \( \epsilon \) and \( \delta \) is heavy, which could limit its practical applicability.
- The paper does not fully address the motivation for the problem or provide a review of prior techniques, which may help contextualize the work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation by refining the clarity and polish of the writing, particularly in sections discussing complex concepts. Additionally, we suggest including more applications or motivations for the problem in the introduction and providing a brief review of prior works to contextualize their contributions. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore ways to reduce the heavy dependence on \( \epsilon \) and \( \delta \) in the computational complexity of their algorithms.
