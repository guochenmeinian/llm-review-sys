### Key Points
This paper presents the first multilingual simplification corpus for the medical domain, named MULTICOCHRANE, which includes aligned sentence pairs in English, Spanish, French, and Farsi sourced from the Cochrane Library. The authors propose two subsets: MC-CLEAN, consisting of manually aligned technical abstracts, and MC-NOISY, a larger but noisier dataset created through automatic alignment. The study evaluates various pre-trained language models on text simplification across these languages, highlighting significant performance degradation in non-English texts and the challenges of translating simplifications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of MULTICOCHRANE advances multilingual medical text simplification.
- The dataset creation method, including both MC-CLEAN and MC-NOISY subsets, is innovative and valuable for future research.
- Systematic evaluation of simplification models provides insights into their performance across languages.
- Inclusion of human assessments alongside automatic evaluations enhances understanding of model effectiveness.
- The release of resources promotes further research in the field.

Weaknesses:
- Lack of experiments with language models specifically built for the medical domain.
- Insufficient justification for the chosen approach and the limitations of sentence-level simplification.
- Weak correlation between automatic metrics and human evaluations raises questions about the validity of the results.
- The uneven distribution of resources across languages may bias the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for their approach, particularly regarding the choice of sentence-level simplification and its limitations in the medical context. Additionally, we suggest exploring the simplify-and-translate approach for comparison and conducting experiments with language models specifically trained for the medical domain. Providing more detailed information about the experimental setup, including hyperparameters, would enhance reproducibility. Finally, addressing ethical concerns related to intellectual property and annotator compensation is essential for the integrity of the research.
