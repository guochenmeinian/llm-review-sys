### Key Points
This paper presents an evaluation of transfer learning using two networks on two datasets, focusing on accuracy comparisons for various tasks fine-tuned from proxy tasks. The authors provide clear formulas and experimental settings but lack novelty due to the use of pre-existing networks. The experiments assess accuracy across different sub-datasets, yet the evaluation of transfer learning is limited to accuracy metrics. The paper offers some insights into the structure of cognitive tasks, supported by figures.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The experimental validation is thorough, with substantial discussion on clinical and cognitive insights relevant to EEG applications.  
- The paper is well-structured, with clear presentation of formulas and experimental settings.  

Weaknesses:  
- The work lacks novelty as it compares already developed networks.  
- The evaluation is limited to accuracy, without considering other potential metrics.  
- Class prevalence statistics are not provided, raising questions about the appropriateness of balanced accuracy as a metric.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of the work by incorporating additional datasets for comparison and varying the settings on the proxy training tasks, such as adjusting the amount of training datasets and training epochs. Additionally, it would be beneficial to comment on the choice of balanced accuracy in the appendix or to provide a more detailed table of metrics to clarify its appropriateness for evaluating transfer learning efficacy.
