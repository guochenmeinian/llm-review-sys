### Key Points
This paper presents a study of restless multi-armed bandits (RMAB) with global rewards, addressing the limitation of traditional RMABs that assume separable rewards across arms. The authors propose the RMAB-G framework, introducing linear and Shapley-Whittle indices to handle non-separable global rewards. They establish approximation bounds for these indices and provide empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world data, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The RMAB-G model introduces a novel perspective on non-separable global rewards, expanding the existing literature on RMABs.
2. The proposed linear and Shapley-Whittle indices are theoretically grounded, with approximation bounds provided.
3. Comprehensive experimental evaluations showcase the performance of the proposed algorithms across various scenarios.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation for the RMAB-G framework, particularly its application to food rescue, lacks clarity and may seem forced.
2. Scalability concerns arise, as the proposed solutions may not perform well with a larger number of arms due to the computational complexity of calculating the Shapley index.
3. Some key concepts, such as indexability and the Whittle index, are assumed to be common knowledge, potentially alienating readers unfamiliar with these terms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for the RMAB-G framework, particularly in relation to its application in various scenarios beyond food rescue. Additionally, we suggest that the authors address scalability issues by providing insights into the computational complexity of their algorithms. It would also be beneficial to introduce key concepts more thoroughly to enhance accessibility for a broader audience. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore the implications of their theoretical results on adaptive approaches and discuss potential applications of their methods in non-monotonic and non-submodular reward settings.
