### Key Points
This paper presents a debiasing method for vision-language models in a multi-modality setting, proposing two techniques, ATE-D and TE-D, to mitigate biases by leveraging causally-driven information loss on biased features. The authors investigate bias from confounding factors within a causal graph and demonstrate that their methods enhance out-of-distribution performance across multiple datasets while maintaining in-distribution performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper utilizes causally-motivated information to learn confounder representations from biased features, offering a reasonable solution for debiasing multimodal models.
2. It is well-structured and presents good visual cases to describe the content.
3. The authors propose a sufficiency score to quantify reliance on spurious features.

Weaknesses:
1. Several sections lack clarity, such as the causal relationship in lines 262-266 and the bias considered in line 282.
2. The experimental section raises concerns, including unclear relationships between variables and insufficient comparisons with existing baselines.
3. The novelty of the proposed methods is questioned, as they appear to build on established concepts without sufficient proof of their advantages.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity in the explanation of causal relationships and biases, particularly in lines 262-266 and 282. Additionally, we suggest including more related works and comparing with established baselines to strengthen the experimental section. It would be beneficial to provide straightforward visualizations demonstrating how the proposed methods learn confounders. Furthermore, a discussion on the limitations of targeted data augmentation methods and their practical applications would enhance the paper's depth. Lastly, addressing the relationship between variables and confounders in latent representations should be clarified.
