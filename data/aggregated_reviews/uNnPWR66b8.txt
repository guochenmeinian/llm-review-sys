Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical analysis of two main score-based approaches: score-based causal discovery and score-based generative modeling. The authors provide sample complexity error bounds for score matching using ReLU neural networks and establish an upper bound on the error rate. Additionally, they derive a sample complexity bound for score estimation under specific assumptions, including the use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Lipschitz conditions on the score function.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work offers strong theoretical results and sufficient background for understanding the theoretical problems, including a comprehensive discussion of related work.
- The paper is significant in addressing sample complexity in score function estimation, relevant to both causal structure learning and score-based generative modeling.
- The clarity of presentation is commendable, with relevant notations defined and implications of theorems discussed.

Weaknesses:
- The relationship between score-based causal discovery and score-based generative modeling is unclear, and insights on their connection are lacking.
- The background section is excessively lengthy compared to the main content, which may detract from the focus on new material.
- There is a lack of empirical validation, such as experiments to corroborate the theoretical results, which could enhance the paper's impact.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the relationship between score-based causal discovery and score-based generative modeling by providing insights on shared techniques and their interconnections. Additionally, including a definition of covering number would enhance the self-containment of the work. For Assumption 2, the authors should provide more justification and a specific example demonstrating its practical relevance. Incorporating proof sketches could clarify the technical contributions and differentiate this work from previous studies. Lastly, we suggest conducting a small set of experiments to validate the theoretical results, which would significantly strengthen the paper.
