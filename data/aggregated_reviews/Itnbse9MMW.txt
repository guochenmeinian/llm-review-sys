Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a literature review comparing research on mental health conversational agents (CAs) in the computer science and medical fields. The authors highlight the disparity in focus between the two disciplines, with computer science emphasizing technical model aspects and medical research prioritizing user experience. The paper identifies a technological gap, noting that computer science employs more advanced models than those typically used in medical applications. The authors call for collaboration between the fields to address these issues.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and addresses integral issues in mental health conversational agents.  
- It provides a thorough overview of the research landscape and effectively summarizes the differing approaches of the two fields.  
- The authors make relevant recommendations to bridge the gap between computer science and medical research.

Weaknesses:  
- The recommendations for future interdisciplinary work are not sufficiently detailed.  
- The inclusion criteria for the literature review are not comprehensive enough, potentially omitting relevant research from other important venues.  
- The focus on specific technical approaches may limit the paper's appeal to a broader audience.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the inclusivity of their literature review by considering additional proceedings such as COLING, CHI, and INTERSPEECH, and expanding the keyword list to include "dialogue system." Additionally, we suggest that the authors place greater emphasis on collaborative efforts between the AI and medical fields, not only in conversational agents but also in peer and multi-party conversational analysis. Finally, we encourage the authors to address potential biases in their selection of papers to enhance the generalizability of their findings.
