### Key Points
This paper presents a solution to the issue of heterogeneous clients in federated learning by introducing two sampling strategies for spectral model sharding, which partitions model parameters into low-rank matrices using singular value decomposition (SVD). The first strategy generates unbiased estimators of the original weights, while the second minimizes the squared approximation error. Both strategies can be integrated into the federated learning loop, and empirical results indicate performance improvements across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper offers an innovative approach to sampling strategies for spectral model sharding, with closed-form solutions that enhance practical implementation. The methods do not necessitate additional computations on client devices, thereby improving efficiency. The incorporation of unbiased estimators and the consideration of client-specific sub-models set this work apart from previous heuristic designs, suggesting potential performance enhancements.

Weaknesses:  
Concerns arise from the reliance on SVD, which incurs significant computational costs, particularly with repeated decompositions after each communication round. The absence of a comparison with the FedHM method in the experimental section limits the understanding of the proposed strategies' strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, the analysis primarily focuses on pre-client update approximation errors, leaving post-client update performance unaddressed. The paper also lacks a convergence analysis, which would provide valuable insights into the proposed algorithm's effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the feasibility of their approach by exploring methods to mitigate the computational costs associated with SVD, such as utilizing approximations or reducing the frequency of SVD decompositions. Including a comparison with the FedHM method would enhance the comprehensiveness of the experimental results. Furthermore, we suggest adding a convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm to strengthen the paper and provide deeper insights into its performance. Lastly, addressing the collective estimator's limitations in heterogeneous settings would improve the practical applicability of the proposed strategies.
