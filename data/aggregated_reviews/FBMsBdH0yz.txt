Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents results on masked unique hard-attention transformers, classifying the languages recognized by these models using formal languages. Specifically, it introduces an auxiliary language called B-RASP to analyze these architectures, demonstrating that future-masked rightmost-hard attention transformers without positional embedding recognize exactly the star-free languages (Theorem 5), while non-strict masked hard-attention transformers without positional embedding recognize stutter-invariant star-free languages (Theorem 6). The authors establish equivalences between B-RASP and Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), showing that masked-hard attention transformers recognize the same languages as LTL with monadic predicates.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The results, particularly Theorems 5 and 6, contribute to understanding the expressive capabilities of transformer models from a formal languages perspective.  
- The technical proofs in the appendix are convincing and well-argued, allowing for verification.

Weaknesses:  
- The significance of the contributions may not be immediately apparent, as the transformer architectures considered are quite specific and tailored for these results.  
- The presentation is mixed; the first five pages focus heavily on preliminaries and B-RASP, which, while interesting, detracts from the main results. Theorems lack proof sketches or intuitive explanations in the main text.  
- Clarity issues arise from the use of a strict LTL version that may confuse non-expert readers, and some results, like those in Theorem 5, are difficult to understand without further clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation by providing proof sketches or intuitive explanations for the main theorems within the body of the paper. Additionally, including a dedicated section summarizing limitations would enhance clarity. It would also be beneficial to clarify the use of LTL with a strict until operator and to address the implications of the results and potential future work. Finally, consider revising the technical parts for better readability and ensuring that the connection between B-RASP and the main results is clearly articulated.
