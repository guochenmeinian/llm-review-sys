Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a joint valuation framework, 2D-OOB, for data attribution that identifies both sample and cell-level outliers, enhancing interpretability in data valuation. The authors propose that 2D-OOB is more efficient and model-agnostic compared to the 2D-Shapley model, utilizing a subset bagging approach with decision trees as weak learners. The framework also demonstrates the ability to localize backdoor triggers in data poisoning attacks, supported by comprehensive experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- The proposed method integrates random feature selection with data-OOB, addressing an underexplored problem and demonstrating computational efficiency.
- The improvement in backdoor trigger detection is promising, particularly in targeted contamination scenarios.
- An ablation study is provided to assess the impact of weak learner selection and feature subset ratios.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the proposed method is limited, as it appears to be a natural extension of existing frameworks (OOB and 2D-Shapley).
- The experiments lack clarity on whether classification labels change post-poisoning and do not adequately address the scalability of the method with larger images or high-dimensional data.
- The paper does not clearly differentiate its application on images compared to other model attribution methods.
- The distance regularization term in the utility function is not explained, and inconsistencies in the cell valuation size displayed in figures raise questions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding the impact of classification label changes after poisoning and provide a detailed analysis of the scalability of the proposed method on larger datasets. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clearly articulate the differences in application on images compared to other methods and explain the distance regularization term mentioned in the utility function. Finally, addressing the inconsistencies in cell valuation sizes in figures would enhance the paper's rigor.
