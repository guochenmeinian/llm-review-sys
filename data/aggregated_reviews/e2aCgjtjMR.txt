Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method to provide tight and computable bounds on the Equalized Odds (EOD) violation of classifiers when sensitive attributes are unknown. The authors propose a post-processing technique to achieve minimal worst-case EOD violations while maximizing prediction power. The work is validated through experiments on both synthetic and real datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem addressed is significant and relevant to the field of fair machine learning.
- The proposed solution is novel, technically sound, and offers theoretical guarantees for practitioners.
- The presentation is clear, particularly the informative related work section, and limitations are analyzed in detail.
- The method is simple, intuitive, and computationally inexpensive.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on Assumption 1 may limit the applicability of the approach, particularly in scenarios where proxy sensitive attributes are inaccurate.
- The evaluation is limited, with only one real-world example provided; additional examples are needed to demonstrate the method's effectiveness across various scenarios.
- The paper does not clarify how to extend the approach to non-binary sensitive attributes, which is crucial given the examples provided.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding Assumption 1, including its limitations and potential solutions. Additionally, we suggest adding more real-world examples to validate the method and demonstrate its effectiveness in different contexts. It would also be beneficial to include a subsection addressing how the results would change when the sensitive attribute is not binary. Finally, clarifying how the proposed post-processing method can be implemented in real-world scenarios would enhance the practical applicability of the work.
