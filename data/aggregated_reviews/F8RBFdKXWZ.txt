### Key Points
This paper presents InfoMAE, an innovative self-supervised learning framework for joint multimodal pretraining, specifically targeting real-world IoT applications such as Moving Object Detection (MOD) and Human Activity Recognition (HAR). The authors propose a solution that effectively addresses the challenges of multimodal data alignment and pretraining, particularly when multimodal pairs are limited. Evaluated on multiple datasets, InfoMAE demonstrates superior performance compared to existing contrastive learning frameworks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The integration of contrastive learning and Masked Autoencoders (MAE) into a unified framework shows promise for improving multimodal alignment in data-scarce scenarios.
2. The authors identify a critical need for effective multimodal self-supervised learning frameworks, contributing to a relevant research direction in AI.
3. Extensive experiments across various datasets validate the robustness and flexibility of InfoMAE, with performance metrics indicating significant improvements over previous methods.
4. The choice of datasets and the use of multiple evaluation metrics enhance the analysis, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed method.
5. The framework has substantial potential for practical applications in multimodal data scenarios.

Weaknesses:
1. The methodology lacks clarity in explaining the fusion of modality-specific features within the joint encoder-decoder architecture, which may hinder reader comprehension.
2. Limitations of the proposed approach are insufficiently discussed, particularly regarding performance under extreme data sparsity and the trade-offs between computational complexity and model performance.
3. The comparison with multimodal SSL baselines is limited, lacking a discussion of alternative joint multimodal pretraining methods outside of contrastive learning or MAE frameworks.
4. Data augmentation's role in multimodal pretraining is mentioned but not explored in detail, leaving potential insights unaddressed.
5. A discussion on the computational cost and scalability of InfoMAE is needed, especially given the substantial resources required for training.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- We recommend that the authors clarify the explanation of the encoder-decoder architecture, particularly regarding the fusion of shared and private representations.
- The authors should include a more thorough discussion of the model's limitations, especially concerning computational cost and data sparsity.
- We suggest providing more detailed comparisons with other joint multimodal pretraining approaches to enhance contextual understanding.
- The analysis of data augmentation's impact on model performance should be expanded to explore different strategies in more detail.
- We recommend discussing the scalability of the framework in real-world applications and its suitability for low-resource settings.
