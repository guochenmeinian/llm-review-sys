### Key Points
This paper presents conditions for AI personhood and discusses past works that measure these conditions, concluding that current AI systems should not be considered persons. The authors propose that discussions surrounding AI often overlook the potential for AI personhood, which is a significant aspect of the conversation. However, the motivation for grouping language and Theory of Mind lacks compelling justification, as personhood exists independently of the ability to speak. The paper reads more like an ethics discussion than a machine learning workshop contribution, raising questions about its fit for the venue.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The introduction provides a strong overview and relevant background.  
- The section on conditions for personhood is well organized and easy to follow.  
- The authors effectively cite cognitive science and machine learning literature, particularly in supporting claims about language models lacking Theory of Mind.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper does not contextualize its propositions with existing criteria for personhood, which would strengthen its arguments.  
- The reasoning lacks the concrete detail preferred in scientific discourse.  
- The discussion on RL fails to clarify that intentions and beliefs may be programmed by humans rather than being inherent to the agent.  
- The authors do not adequately address their posed questions regarding AI agency and should conclude that no contemporary solution meets the proposed conditions for personhood.  
- The conclusion hints at the consequences of recognizing AI as persons but lacks an explicit discussion of potential outcomes and future work needed in this area.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the contextualization of their propositions by including existing criteria for personhood. Additionally, they should clarify the distinction between programmed intentions and inherent agency in the discussion on RL. It would be beneficial to explicitly answer the posed questions regarding AI agency and conclude that current solutions do not meet the conditions for personhood. We also suggest expanding the conclusion to include a discussion of the potential consequences of AI personhood and outlining future work needed to evaluate AI capabilities in this context.
