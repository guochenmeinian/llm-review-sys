### Key Points
This paper presents the Contrastive Reading Model (Cream), a novel neural architecture aimed at enhancing the language-image understanding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the visual domain, particularly for text-rich images. The authors propose Cream to bridge the gap between vision and language understanding, facilitating the development of sophisticated Document Intelligence Assistants. Cream integrates vision and auxiliary encoders, utilizing a contrastive feature alignment technique to improve comprehension of language in visually situated contexts. The paper demonstrates Cream's compelling performance in visually-situated language understanding tasks and provides a codebase and datasets for reproducibility.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of the Contrastive Reading Model (Cream) significantly improves language-image understanding in the visual domain.
- The authors effectively address practical limitations of existing models, paving the way for advanced Document Intelligence Assistants.
- Comprehensive evaluations showcase Cream's strong performance across various tasks, reinforcing its effectiveness and practical applicability.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks an ablation study to clarify the quantitative contributions of each component, particularly regarding the contrastive learning technique.
- The model description, training objectives, and evaluation metrics are complex and difficult to understand, requiring multiple readings for clarity.
- Evaluation solely based on accuracy may not adequately reflect model performance, as it does not account for spurious correlations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the model description, training objectives, and evaluation metrics to enhance reader comprehension. Additionally, we suggest including an ablation study to elucidate the contributions of each component, particularly the contrastive learning technique. To address evaluation concerns, we advise exploring alternative metrics, such as mean rank on different question types or perplexity, to better assess model performance in visual question answering tasks.
