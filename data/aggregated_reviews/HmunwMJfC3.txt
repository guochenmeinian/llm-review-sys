### Key Points
This paper presents an efficient algorithm for minimizing network connectivity in large-scale graphs, addressing critical issues such as virus propagation suppression and information diffusion optimization. The authors introduce a surrogate matrix to approximate eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix, enabling faster calculations and demonstrating superior performance through extensive experiments across various networks, including Twitter and Facebook. The paper is well-structured, with clear language and logical flow, effectively connecting problem definition, algorithm design, and experimental validation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed algorithm exhibits linear scalability with respect to node count and is independent of edge density, making it suitable for dense networks.
- Rigorous proofs establish that the surrogate matrix eigenvalues approximate those of the residual adjacency matrix with predefined error bounds.
- Comprehensive evaluations indicate superior performance in minimizing connectivity metrics and computational time compared to existing methods.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a clear security context and threat model, failing to justify its application to web security.
- Experimental evaluations focus on general graph metrics that do not directly relate to security or privacy objectives.
- The selection of baseline methods is conservative, with the latest baseline from 2020, and the datasets used are sparse social networks rather than dense ones.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the abstract by defining k and n. Additionally, we suggest addressing the uncommon word divisions and ensuring consistent terminology, such as using "the Internet." The authors should clarify the reasoning behind the choice of baselines and consider including more recent methods. Furthermore, we advise incorporating security-related evaluations that measure resilience to specific threats and establishing a formalized threat model to articulate adversarial objectives. Lastly, we recommend using denser datasets to better support the claimed contributions.
