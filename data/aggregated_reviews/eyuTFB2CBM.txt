### Key Points
This paper presents a Knowledge Enhanced Prompt Learning approach for Chinese hypernym-hyponym extraction and introduces a new dataset constructed through a rule-based method verified by human annotators. The authors propose a framework that learns a unified representation of context and demonstrates improved performance over several baselines, including state-of-the-art models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The construction of a new hypernym dataset in Chinese is a significant contribution.
- The proposed framework shows effective performance improvements compared to existing methods.
- The experimental analysis is thorough and supports the claims made.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset construction lacks transparency regarding the specific rules and annotation guidelines.
- There are missing references that could enhance the literature context.
- Presentation issues, including unclear figures and tables, hinder understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the dataset construction process by detailing the specific rules and annotation guidelines used. Additionally, the authors should provide English translations for case studies in Tables 2 and 4 to enhance comprehension. We suggest proofreading the manuscript to address presentation issues, particularly in Figure 1 and throughout the text. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the framework's parameters and tensor shapes, as well as include comparisons with typical prompt approaches and existing hypernym detection methods to justify their architectural choices. Lastly, addressing the missing references would strengthen the paper's foundation.
