Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework for approximating Graph Diffusion Equations (GDEs) through local diffusion processes, significantly enhancing computational efficiency for large-scale graphs. The authors propose local solvers that leverage the localization properties of diffusion vectors, achieving substantial speed improvements—up to a hundred-fold—over traditional methods. The framework is applicable to various GDEs, including Personalized PageRank (PPR), Katz centrality, and the Heat kernel, and is designed to be parallelizable for GPU implementation. The paper also highlights the potential of these methods to improve local message-passing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a novel framework for localizing GDE computations is a significant contribution.
- The theoretical foundation is robust, demonstrating strong localization properties of diffusion vectors.
- Experimental results show significant acceleration over standard methods, validating the proposed local solvers.

Weaknesses:
- Precision limitations arise as performance gains diminish with higher precision requirements, potentially affecting applicability in precision-critical scenarios.
- Some methods, like LocalSOR, still rely on sequential updates, which may hinder parallel efficiency.
- The complexity of runtime analysis for methods like the Local Chebyshev method remains an open problem, suggesting a need for simplification or clearer explanations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the runtime complexity analysis, particularly regarding how graph structures impact the performance of local solvers. Additionally, the authors should provide a clear update rule for $\mathcal{S}_t$ in LocalGD and LocalCH, as its definition is currently lacking. It would also be beneficial to discuss the trade-offs between precision and computational efficiency more explicitly, and to clarify the conditions under which notable speedups occur, especially in relation to the bounds established in Theorem 3.3 and Corollary 3.6.
