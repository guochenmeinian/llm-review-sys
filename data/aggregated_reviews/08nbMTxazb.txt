Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents "Chicks4FreeID," the first publicly available dataset for chicken re-identification, containing 677 images of 50 hens, two roosters, and two ducks. The dataset includes 1270 meticulously hand-labeled cut-out crops and binary instance masks, aimed at advancing animal husbandry and welfare through AI-driven monitoring. The authors provide baseline models for re-identification using three approaches (MegaDescriptor, Swin Transformer, Vision Transformer), achieving high accuracy. The dataset is motivated by the need for automation in the domesticated chicken industry.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The first dataset dedicated to chicken re-identification, filling a significant gap in the field.
- High-quality instance masks and comprehensive documentation of data collection.
- The dataset can contribute to animal welfare through automated monitoring.

Weaknesses:
- Limited dataset size (677 images) and diversity of chicken breeds, potentially affecting generalizability.
- All images were collected on a single day, limiting longitudinal re-identification capabilities.
- The necessity and significance of chicken re-identification research have not been adequately justified.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the need to research chicken re-identification, addressing its significance despite the absence of publicly available datasets. Clarifying the terminology used for chickens, hens, and roosters is essential. Additionally, the authors should provide estimates of the breeds represented in the dataset and discuss the implications of using a single-day data collection approach. It would be beneficial to explore potential future research directions, especially in light of the high success rates already achieved. Lastly, addressing the ethical considerations more thoroughly, including obtaining formal approval from an ethics committee, would strengthen the paper.
