Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents UniFL, a unified framework aimed at enhancing diffusion models through feedback learning. The authors propose three key components: perceptual feedback learning, decoupled aesthetic feedback learning, and adversarial feedback learning, targeting visual quality, aesthetic appeal, and inference efficiency. UniFL operates as a two-stage training pipeline applicable to various models, demonstrating significant improvements in generation quality and speed through extensive experimental validation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The writing is commendable, with a well-structured format.
2. A large number of visualization experiments effectively illustrate the method's focus and effectiveness.
3. The proposed method is a plug-and-play solution that improves performance on both SD15 and SDXL.
4. The combination of feedback learning and diffusion models is well-motivated and clearly presented, supported by abundant pipeline figures and pseudocode.

Weaknesses:
1. Minor LaTeX formatting issues exist, such as inconsistent spacing before parentheses and incorrect quotes in the Appendix.
2. Hyper-parameter values, such as \alpha_d, are not explicitly stated.
3. The qualitative visualization comparison primarily justifies overall generation style, neglecting potential detail loss during inference speed-up.
4. The method's reliance on a limited selection of perceptual models may restrict its effectiveness, and performance is not significantly superior to existing methods.
5. There are inconsistencies in generated images, indicating potential overfitting.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of hyper-parameter specifications, including explicit values for parameters like \alpha_d. Additionally, we suggest providing further visual comparisons to demonstrate the model's ability to maintain detail during inference speed-up. The authors should also explore the impact of different aesthetics on generated images and consider comparing with SDXL-IR and SDXL-DPO in the Ablation on Acceleration Steps. Finally, addressing the inconsistencies in generated outputs and clarifying the methodology behind the hinge loss and prompt selection would enhance the paper's rigor.
