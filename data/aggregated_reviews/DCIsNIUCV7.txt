Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of learning in quantum games, specifically focusing on a variant of the matrix multiplicative weight (MMW) algorithm called 3MW. The authors propose that 3MW, which requires only zeroth-order gradient information, achieves an equilibrium convergence rate of O(T^{-1/4}) in N-player quantum games. Additionally, the paper discusses the algorithm's ability to converge to Nash equilibria under certain stability conditions and provides numerical simulations to support its findings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper addresses a significant question in quantum game learning by appropriately utilizing a bandit framework, which is suitable given the limitations of gradient information. The results on variational stability are noteworthy, presenting a broad last-iterate convergence result in N-player quantum games. The writing quality and structure of the paper are commendable, facilitating reader comprehension.

Weaknesses:  
The technical novelty of the methods employed is not clearly articulated, as many techniques resemble those from classical bandit settings. The claim regarding the tightness of regret bounds is misleading, as recent literature presents improved results. Furthermore, the dependence on dimensionality lacks a quantum speedup, which may limit the applicability of the proposed framework.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the technical contributions by explicitly distinguishing the novel aspects of their approach from classical methods. Additionally, it would be beneficial to address the discrepancies regarding regret bounds in the introduction and provide a more thorough discussion of the implications of dimensionality on the algorithm's performance. We also suggest that the authors elaborate on the necessity of the L-smooth assumption in quantum games and clarify the applications of bilinear quantum games to strengthen the paper's relevance. Finally, including more detailed numerical evidence to support claims about convergence rates would enhance the paper's robustness.
