### Key Points
This paper presents an MCMC-inspired method for sampling from the Thompson sampling distribution in Gaussian process bandits, aiming to enhance Bayesian optimization. The authors propose a novel approach that builds on the p* sampler of Ren and Sweet, demonstrating effectiveness in experiments. However, the paper lacks clarity in several critical areas, particularly regarding the stationary distribution of the Markov chain and its relation to Thompson sampling.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The method is straightforward to implement.  
- Empirical results show significant performance gains over existing approaches.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper does not analyze the stationary distribution of the Markov chain, leaving the justification for sampling from the Thompson sampling distribution unclear.  
- The interfacing of MTV with the proposed approach is poorly explained.  
- Claims of computational speed improvements over the p* sampler lack a reasonable comparison of computational effort.  
- The clarity regarding the "exactness" of the proposed sampling scheme is insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the algorithm by providing an analysis of the stationary distribution of the Markov chain to justify its sampling properties. Additionally, the authors should clarify the interfacing of MTV in section 3.3. A detailed comparison of computational efforts between the proposed method and the p* sampler is necessary to support claims of speed improvements. Furthermore, addressing the clarity of the "exactness" of the sampling scheme is essential. Minor revisions should include standardizing terminology, such as replacing "ex." with "for example," and reconsidering the use of "arm dimension" in the abstract. Lastly, it would be beneficial to start with an example where prior work can be implemented effectively.
