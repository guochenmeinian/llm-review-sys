Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an algorithm for controlling complex physical systems, specifically through the introduction of Diffusion Physical Systems Control (DiffPhyCon). The method employs diffusion models to generate near-optimal controllers for systems described by partial differential equations (PDEs), utilizing a learned generative energy function and a control objective. The authors propose a prior reweighting technique to enhance the sampling of control sequences. The paper includes extensive simulations on the 1D Burgers equation and 2D jellyfish movement control, demonstrating the method's performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem addressed is significant and well-motivated.
- The presentation is clear, and the methodology is well-illustrated.
- The paper provides detailed experimental results, including a benchmark dataset for jellyfish movement control.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed method does not convincingly demonstrate its effectiveness in high-dimensional and complex tasks, as both numerical examples are low-dimensional and their dynamics are not sufficiently complex.
- The contribution of the paper is unclear compared to similar work published in ICLR, raising concerns about novelty.
- The method relies on data generated by finite difference methods, which may limit its applicability due to the curse of dimensionality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their claims regarding the global optimization of long-term dynamics, particularly in relation to the open-loop nature of the control design. Additionally, we suggest revising the introduction to emphasize motion planning as the primary objective. To strengthen the paper, the authors should consider providing error analysis for the fluid dynamics simulation and clarify how the offline dataset is generated, including whether it encompasses optimal control trajectories. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore the potential for their algorithm to operate independently of classical methods for data generation.
