Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration-exploitation algorithm for contextual dynamic pricing, addressing the challenge of noisy buyer valuations. The authors propose a method to obtain unbiased estimates of the true valuation function and analyze its performance under linear and non-parametric valuation models. The algorithm achieves optimal regret bounds, specifically $O(T^{2/3})$ for the linear model and $O(T^{d+2\beta/d+3\beta})$ for the non-parametric model.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with adequate intuitions provided.  
- It introduces a novel framework for contextual dynamic pricing, leading to improved regret bounds in the linear case.  
- The theoretical results appear correct and are well-motivated from a practical perspective.  

Weaknesses:  
- The assumption of i.i.d. noise across contexts is a significant limitation.  
- The paper lacks experimental results, which would validate the proposed algorithms.  
- There are concerns regarding the similarity of the proposed algorithm to existing works, particularly the "Explore-then-UCB" algorithm, and the need for a detailed discussion on this similarity.  
- The assumption of Lipschitzness on the noise CDF may not be necessary, as indicated by prior work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the differences between their method and the "Explore-then-UCB" algorithm to clarify their contribution. Additionally, we suggest including a thorough experimental campaign to validate the efficiency of the algorithms. The authors should also address the necessity of the Lipschitz assumption and consider discussing the implications of the "Half-Lipschitz" nature of the pricing problem. Lastly, clarifying the significance of the green/red color coding in Table 1 and resolving margin issues would enhance the presentation.
