Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new privacy accounting method called estimate-verify-release (EVR), which converts an estimate of a privacy parameter into a formal privacy guarantee. The authors propose a Monte Carlo-based verifier for this paradigm, demonstrating its broad applicability and improved privacy-utility tradeoff compared to existing methods. The work includes empirical evaluations showing significant improvements, particularly in the large epsilon/small delta regime.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors introduce a clever technique for using composition privacy loss estimates, enhancing the accuracy of privacy bounds.
2. The analysis of the proposed method is detailed and accessible, with empirical tests across various settings.
3. The framework is broadly applicable, particularly to important differential privacy algorithms like DP-SGD.
4. The method outperforms existing accounting tools, such as CLT and FFT-based methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The improvement in epsilon for Gaussian mechanism composition is minimal (<1%) in empirical studies.
2. Some aspects of the new accountant's analysis lack rigor, particularly regarding the number of Monte Carlo samples and the nu parameter in Theorem 13.
3. The potential for the method to suffer from the curse of dimensionality when deriving privacy loss samples for general distributions remains unaddressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the rigor of the analysis and implementation of the accountant, particularly by providing a fully formal version for DP-SGD. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include more experiments to validate the robustness of the results shown in Figure 5 across different problem settings. We also suggest discussing the practical implications of the halting probability in the EVR framework more thoroughly. Finally, the authors should ensure that all figures are in vector format to enhance their clarity and professionalism.
