### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to multi-behavior sequential recommendation systems, addressing challenges related to long user behavior sequences and noise in recommendation data. The authors propose an Efficient Behavior Sequence Miner (EBM) that utilizes fast Fourier transform for efficient pattern capture, alongside a Behavior-Aware Denoising module comprising a Hard Noise Eliminator and a Soft Noise Filter. A noise-decoupling contrastive learning framework is also introduced to enhance model training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed method's superior performance compared to various baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The dual approach to noise-decoupling effectively addresses both hard and soft noise types.
2. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets show consistent improvements in prediction accuracy, with average gains of 5% to 8% over baselines.
3. The EBM module efficiently captures complex user behavior patterns while maintaining low computational cost.

Weaknesses:
1. The integration of multiple components complicates the assessment of individual contributions, particularly between the EBM and the denoising framework; an ablation study with EBM alone is recommended.
2. The categorization of noise into discrete and continuous types oversimplifies the complexities of real-world user behavior noise.
3. Implementation details, such as optimizer choice and negative sample count, are insufficiently detailed, hindering reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the model's rationale by providing insights into how different user behaviors reflect preferences for items. Additionally, specifying hyperparameter settings in the implementation details would enhance reproducibility. The authors should also consider addressing the performance discrepancies observed in baseline models, particularly the significant drop in ADT's performance compared to previous studies. Finally, we suggest including a comparison with the MB-CGCN model to provide broader context for the evaluation.
