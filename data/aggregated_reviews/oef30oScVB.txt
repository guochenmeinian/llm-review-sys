Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the effectiveness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on nodes with varying structural patterns in real-world graphs, proposing a method to identify reasons for performance disparities. The authors find that GNNs excel on homophilic nodes in homophilic graphs but struggle with heterophilic nodes. They analyze aggregated feature distance and homophily ratio differences between training and testing nodes, deriving a non-i.i.d. PAC-Bayesian generalization bound for GNNs. The paper also emphasizes the impact of these disparities on node-level classification tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper provides empirical and theoretical evidence, including rigorous analyses and a non-i.i.d. PAC-Bayesian generalization bound, enhancing its credibility.  
- It includes extensive real-world experiments demonstrating how homophily ratios and feature distances influence GNN performance, serving as a foundation for future GNN architecture design.  
- The structure and clarity of the presentation are commendable, making complex concepts accessible.

Weaknesses:  
- The writing requires improvement, with some sections needing more elaboration and clarity.  
- The classification of nodes into homophily and heterophily using a hard threshold oversimplifies the problem, potentially overlooking complexities in real-world scenarios.  
- The paper identifies performance disparities but does not propose solutions to address them.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the writing quality, focusing on clarity and grammatical accuracy. Additionally, we suggest elaborating on key definitions and concepts, such as the definition of heterophilic graphs and the implications of performance disparities. We encourage the authors to explore whether their conclusions hold when using a continuous homophily ratio instead of a hard threshold. Finally, we recommend providing insights into the effectiveness of deeper GNNs on minority nodes and discussing additional factors influencing performance beyond aggregation and homophily ratio differences.
