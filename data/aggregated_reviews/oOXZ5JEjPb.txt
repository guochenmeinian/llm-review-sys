Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a grammar-based activity segmentation method, introducing a grammar induction algorithm (KARI) and an improved parser (BEP) that enhances temporal action segmentation through context-free grammar with recursive rules. The proposed model demonstrates improvements over prior works in grammar induction and action segmentation, achieving good generalization and discrimination capabilities on benchmark datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The exploration of neural-symbolic representations is crucial, particularly given the limited application of such methods to real-world problems.
- The proposed grammar induction method shows improvements over existing works and could benefit future research.
- The writing is clear, and the method is easy to follow, with effective visualizations aiding understanding.
- The introduction of recursive rules is innovative, enhancing the identification of action repetitions.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments primarily compare against non-state-of-the-art baselines, limiting the justification of the proposed method's performance.
- The design of the grammar lacks clarity and justification, particularly in light of recent advances in language modeling.
- The notation used is error-prone and needs improvement for clarity, as it is critical to the grammar-based method's understanding.
- The evaluation is based on a relatively small benchmark, raising concerns about scalability and the computational cost of the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental comparisons by including results on more state-of-the-art benchmarks to strengthen the justification of their method's performance. Additionally, we suggest providing clearer explanations and visual representations of the grammar design to enhance reader understanding. The authors should also conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of each component of KARI and clarify the limitations of the proposed method regarding action types. Lastly, addressing the notation issues and ensuring all references are included will improve the overall presentation.
