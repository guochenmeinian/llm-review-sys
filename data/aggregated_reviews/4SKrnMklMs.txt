Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper reviews recent technologies in the Ethereum ecosystem, focusing on their potential to enhance the adoption of decentralized applications (DApps) beyond gaming and finance. The authors particularly examine rollups, which reduce fees by executing transactions off-chain, and account abstraction, which allows third parties to fund transactions. A case study is presented on the impact of optimistic rollups on transaction fees. However, the paper lacks a systematic comparison of different technologies and insufficiently argues that these technologies will increase adoption.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper effectively illuminates the state of ERC-4337 and its implications for transaction data flow in Ethereum, demonstrating a strong understanding of the complexities associated with account abstraction. The analysis of ERC-4337 and rollup sequencers in relation to accessibility is a significant contribution, reflecting ongoing developments in the field.

Weaknesses:  
The paper's focus is inconsistent, with the title largely unaddressed. It primarily investigates why smart contracts are not widely adopted, emphasizing transaction costs without leading to meaningful conclusions about the role of Layer 2 (L2) solutions. Additionally, while a case study on land registries is included, it lacks deployment details and a public link for testing the DApp.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the systematic comparison of technologies by presenting their potential, drawbacks, and maturity in a table format. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide the deployment address and code for the smart contract on Optimism, along with a public link for testing the DApp. Furthermore, including a paragraph explaining how transaction costs are partitioned between L1 and L2 on Optimism would enhance the methodological clarity of the paper.
