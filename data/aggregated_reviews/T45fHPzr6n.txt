### Key Points
This paper presents **REACT**, a framework aimed at addressing distribution shifts in threat detection systems through meta-learning and hypernetworks for rapid adaptation. REACT decomposes neural network weights into meta and adaptive components, fine-tuning adaptive weights using contextual insights and a small set of unlabeled data. The framework shows significant improvements in AUROC and AUPR scores compared to state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The novel decomposition of weights into meta and adaptive components enhances both generalization and adaptability.
- A convergence analysis provides mathematical guarantees for the linear model's performance.
- Extensive experiments across diverse datasets convincingly showcase REACT's superiority over existing methods.
- The framework's focus on few-shot, unlabeled data makes it applicable to real-world threat detection.
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning reduces computational costs while maintaining high performance.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a discussion on graph-based approaches relevant to modeling contextual relationships, which could enhance the paper's depth.
- Hyperparameter settings, such as learning rates and regularization parameters, are not thoroughly investigated, and a more detailed ablation study is needed.
- While adaptability is discussed, the trade-offs between adaptability and generalization under severe shifts are not analyzed in depth.
- The conclusion does not explicitly address future research directions, missing concrete scenarios and challenges.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on graph-based approaches in the related work section to enhance the paper's comprehensiveness. A more thorough investigation of hyperparameter settings through detailed ablation studies would strengthen the claims made. Additionally, we suggest providing an in-depth analysis of the trade-offs between adaptability and generalization under severe shifts. Finally, the authors should explicitly outline future research directions, including incorporating lightweight mechanisms for meta-model updates during inference and exploring prompt-based learning techniques for better contextual encoding.
