Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents LASE, a novel distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm designed to enhance altruistic cooperation in mixed-motive games through a gifting mechanism. LASE employs counterfactual reasoning to dynamically adjust reward allocations based on inferred social relationships, demonstrating its effectiveness in promoting group collaboration across various experiments. The authors claim contributions including a computational model of empathy, a decentralized algorithm balancing altruism and self-interest, and theoretical analysis of decision dynamics in iterated matrix games.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces an innovative combination of gifting mechanisms and counterfactual reasoning, well-grounded in developmental psychology theories of empathy.  
- It is clearly written and well-organized, with detailed methodology and experimental setups that enhance reproducibility.  
- Comprehensive experiments across various mixed-motive games substantiate the effectiveness of LASE in promoting cooperation and fairness.  
- The framework's fully decentralized nature is a notable advantage over centralized training methods.  

Weaknesses:  
- The method may be perceived as incremental, primarily combining existing techniques without sufficiently contrasting them with prior works.  
- There is a lack of detailed analysis regarding the individual contributions of the gifting mechanism and counterfactual reasoning, with no direct comparison or ablation study provided.  
- The complexity of the framework raises concerns about scalability, particularly as the number of agents increases.  
- Clarity issues exist in explaining how gifts are determined and the design choice for the counterfactual baseline.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of the paper by explicitly contrasting LASE with prior works. Additionally, conducting direct comparisons or ablation studies focusing on the gifting mechanism and counterfactual reasoning would clarify their individual contributions. To address scalability concerns, we suggest including results that test the method with a larger number of agents. Enhancing clarity on the gifting determination process and the counterfactual baseline design would also strengthen the paper. Finally, expanding the range of domains tested could further validate the approach.
