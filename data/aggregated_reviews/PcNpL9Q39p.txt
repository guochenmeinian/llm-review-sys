Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for Responsible AI (RAI) games, where a learner minimizes worst-case loss over predefined distributions, modeled as a zero-sum game against an adversary. The authors propose two algorithms to solve these games and conduct empirical analyses demonstrating their convergence and performance. The paper aims to address various aspects of responsible AI, including fairness and robustness, through a unified approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The topic of responsible AI is significant and timely.
- The theoretical results are supported by proofs in the appendix.
- Sections 2-4 provide a well-structured argument for the utility of the RAI framework.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed framework is overly simplistic and the experiments lack depth, making it challenging to connect theory with motivation.
- The clarity of the presentation is poor, hindering comprehension for a broader AI audience.
- The results are relatively weak, showing performance close to baselines, which does not align with claims of effectively solving RAI games.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper, particularly in the introduction and experimental sections, to better connect the theoretical framework with practical implications. Additionally, consider providing more detailed explanations of the experiments, including research questions, hypotheses, and a thorough analysis of results. Acknowledging alternative definitions of fairness and robustness would enhance the discussion. Finally, including confidence intervals in results tables would allow for better assessment of significance.
