### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical study on the applicability of data balancing for achieving fairness and robustness in machine learning. The authors propose conditions under which data balancing can yield invariant and optimal models, while also demonstrating scenarios where it may fail, particularly when combined with regularization strategies. The analysis includes the effects of data balancing on risk-invariant models and explores the relationship between fairness and robustness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers original insights into data balancing techniques, particularly regarding their failure modes.
- It empirically illustrates both the positive and negative impacts of data balancing, providing valuable contributions to the fields of fairness and robustness.
- The use of causal graphs to analyze data balancing effects is a notable methodological strength.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a clear synthesis of findings into guiding principles or a unified framework for data balancing, which diminishes its overall impact.
- It primarily focuses on negative results without offering constructive solutions, limiting its applicability.
- The presentation is vague in certain areas, and the methodology for determining the effectiveness of data balancing in real-world datasets is impractical.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the synthesis of their findings into clear principles or a unified framework for data balancing. Additionally, the authors should provide constructive solutions to the identified failure modes of data balancing. Clarifying vague sections and enhancing the systematic methodology for assessing data balancing in real-world scenarios would also strengthen the paper. Finally, addressing the relationship between fairness and robustness more explicitly could enhance the paper's coherence and relevance.
