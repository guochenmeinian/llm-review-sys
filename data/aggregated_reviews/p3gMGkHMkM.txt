Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Particle Variational Inference (PVI), a novel method for semi-implicit variational inference (SIVI) that optimizes the evidence lower bound (ELBO) using a particle approximation of an Euclidean–Wasserstein gradient flow without making parametric assumptions about the mixing distribution. The authors provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis and empirical comparisons demonstrating PVI's effectiveness against existing SIVI methods across various tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized, presenting complex concepts with clarity.
- PVI is innovative, grounded in solid theoretical foundations, and effectively implemented, showcasing real-world applicability.
- The theoretical analysis includes existence and uniqueness of solutions and propagation of chaos results, providing a rigorous basis for the practical algorithm.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental section is limited, lacking empirical demonstrations of expressiveness and optimization stability. Comparisons with existing methods do not adequately show PVI's advantages.
- The theoretical analysis for a modified gradient flow (with γ > 0) contrasts with the practical algorithm using γ = 0, though this is somewhat justified.
- Clarity in explaining the flexibility of PVI's variational approximation is lacking, particularly regarding the novelty of not optimizing a specific parametric form.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental validation by including a broader range of numerical experiments, particularly demonstrating the expressiveness of PVI and its optimization stability compared to other SIVI methods. Additionally, clarifying the relationship between the theoretical analysis and the practical implementation, especially regarding the choice of γ, would enhance understanding. We also suggest revising the explanations in Sections 2 and 3 to better articulate the novelty of PVI's approach and addressing the coherence issues noted in the writing.
