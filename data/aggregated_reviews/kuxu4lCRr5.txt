Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents pFedBreD, a framework designed to inject personalized prior knowledge into the global model in personalized federated learning (PFL) to address the incomplete information problem. The authors propose decoupling the personalized prior from the local objective function regularized by Bregman divergence and utilize Relaxed Mirror Descent (RMD) for prior extraction. The paper includes convergence analysis and extensive experimental results demonstrating the method's effectiveness across five datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and structured, providing a clear and comprehensive presentation of the problem and solution.
2. The theoretical examination and convergence analysis are detailed and well-supported.
3. Extensive experimental results validate the proposed method's effectiveness against various baseline algorithms.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation for the work is unclear, particularly regarding the shortcomings of existing PFL methods and the challenges of prior knowledge extraction.
2. Key components, such as the pFedBreD algorithm and Theorem 1, are not included in the main body, affecting the paper's self-sufficiency.
3. The writing requires improvement, particularly in clarity and the definition of acronyms, which may confuse readers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for their work by explicitly detailing the limitations of existing PFL methods and the challenges associated with prior knowledge extraction. Additionally, we suggest including the pFedBreD algorithm and Theorem 1 in the main body for completeness. The authors should also define acronyms such as **mh**, **lg**, and **meg** upon their first use to enhance readability. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the relationship between the methodology and framework sections and to provide a more intuitive explanation of the equations presented in Section 4. Lastly, addressing minor grammatical errors and ensuring that all references and figures are accessible would enhance the overall presentation.
