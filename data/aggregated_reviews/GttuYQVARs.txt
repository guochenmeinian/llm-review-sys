### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to ensuring differential privacy in cross-attention mechanisms within large generative models (LGMs). The authors develop a theoretical guarantee for (ε, δ)-differential privacy using polynomial kernel methods and innovative data structures like DP-TreeSoftmaxAdaptive, demonstrating robustness against adaptive queries. The motivation is clear, and the theoretical analysis is rigorous, marking a significant contribution to privacy protection in AI.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Innovativeness in applying differential privacy to cross-attention mechanisms, addressing critical privacy concerns in AI.
2. Rigorous mathematical proofs that ensure privacy and accuracy guarantees, including robustness to adaptive query attacks.
3. Relevance to current AI applications, particularly in protecting sensitive information in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and system prompts.

Weaknesses:
1. Lack of extensive real-world experiments or performance comparisons with existing privacy-preserving methods, limiting practical insights.
2. High memory and time complexity of the proposed solution may hinder scalability and efficiency in large-scale applications.
3. The method's specificity to cross-attention and RAG systems may restrict its applicability to other AI models or attention mechanisms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors conduct experiments on real datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in practical applications, including privacy protection effects and processing efficiency.
2. We suggest adding an analysis of practical scenarios for the proposed anonymization method, contextualizing it with the latest reference [1] and discussing related advantages and applicable scenarios.
3. We encourage the authors to explore additional optimization algorithms to reduce the time and space complexities of the algorithm, enhancing its suitability for practical applications.
