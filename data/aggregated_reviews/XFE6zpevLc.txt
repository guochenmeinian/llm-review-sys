Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a continuous-time optimization framework for convex objectives that simplifies the process of providing rate guarantees. The authors relax the challenging infinite-dimensional optimization problem (Exact PEP) using convexity and recast it in a dual form, focusing on verifying the positive definiteness of a PEP kernel. This approach parallels the discrete PEP kernel of Drori and Teboulle, with the authors demonstrating that the continuous PEP kernel can be derived as a limit of the discrete one. The method is applied to various accelerated ODE methods and considers multiple standard metrics, yielding rates consistent with state-of-the-art continuous-time guarantees.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The article is clearly presented, with numerous examples illustrating the method, particularly in the search for the Lagrange multiplier function $\Lambda$.
2. Certifying the correctness of the rate guarantee given the H-kernel and Lagrange multiplier is straightforward.
3. The article enhances existing rate guarantees and reproduces many well-known guarantees, clarifying the optimality of Lyapunov functional estimates.
4. The method systematically extends to provide convergence of gradients.

Weaknesses:
1. While the paper eliminates the need for a Lyapunov function, it introduces the challenge of constructing the Lagrange multiplier function $\Lambda$, which lacks a systematic approach.
2. The results lack experimental validation.
3. Verifying the positive semidefiniteness of the integral kernel poses implementation difficulties.
4. The intuition behind the PEP kernel is unclear, and the choices of multiplier functions $\Lambda$ and $\nu$ are complex.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the systematic approach for producing the Lagrange multiplier function $\Lambda$ and highlight its significance more prominently. Additionally, the authors should provide insights into the sharpness of the relaxation of the Exact PEP and explore its role further. We suggest including an outline of the computations mentioned in the paper and clarifying the proofs of Theorem 1 and Theorem 2. Addressing the potential for the supremum in inequalities to be infinite and ensuring consistency in terminology throughout the paper would enhance clarity. Finally, a more comprehensive literature review could be beneficial, potentially included in the appendix to save space.
