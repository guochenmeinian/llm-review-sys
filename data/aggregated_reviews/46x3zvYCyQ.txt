Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on nondifferentiable nonconvex locally constrained federated learning, including its bilevel and minimax variants. The authors provide error, iteration, and communication complexity analyses under assumptions of non-convexity and non-differentiability. They develop zero-order methods for these problems, utilizing a randomized smoothing approach, and present convergence guarantees alongside experimental evaluations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The reasoning behind the algorithm's development is clearly articulated.
- The experiments provide relevant comparisons with existing methods.
- The paper addresses a significant problem class and is well-written.

Weaknesses:
- The results of Theorems 1 and 2 lack discussion, which would clarify their significance and the existence of lower bounds in specific settings.
- The paper is dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with concepts like Moreau smoothing.
- The experiments are limited in scope, focusing on low-dimensional problems without comparisons to established baseline algorithms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding Theorems 1 and 2 to elucidate their significance and clarify the interpretation of various terms. It would be beneficial to define $\mathbb B$ and $I_X^\eta$ for clarity, and to reference relevant equations appropriately. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the presentation of tables and figures for better readability, including increasing font sizes and legends. The authors should also consider expanding their experimental evaluations to include higher-dimensional problems and comparisons with more federated optimization algorithms, such as SCAFFOLD and FedZO, to strengthen their findings.
