Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to framing various classification tasks as a single text alignment task, leveraging the concept of information alignment between two sets of sequences. The authors fine-tune a RoBERTa model on 5.9 million examples from 28 datasets, demonstrating that their text alignment-enhanced model achieves comparable or superior performance to larger language models like FLAN-T5 and GPT-3.5. The results indicate the effectiveness of this method across multiple tasks, including semantic comparison and factual consistency evaluation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The approach of using text alignment as a task-general interface is innovative and has the potential to produce effective models at smaller sizes.
2. The experiments are comprehensive, showing strong performance across various tasks.
3. The paper is well-written and presents clear findings that contribute to the field.

Weaknesses:
1. The evaluation is limited to tasks seen during alignment fine-tuning, raising questions about the generalizability of the model compared to multi-task fine-tuning.
2. The tasks included in training and evaluation are closely related to entailment, which may not fully demonstrate the model's capabilities on more diverse tasks.
3. The claim that smaller model sizes result from the alignment approach needs further validation through ablation studies comparing it to instruction-finetuned models on the same datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including tasks that were not part of the training set to better demonstrate the model's generalizability. Additionally, incorporating tasks that are further removed from entailment, such as POS tagging, could provide insights into the model's adaptability. We also suggest conducting ablation studies to clarify whether the smaller model sizes are indeed a result of the alignment approach or simply due to a narrower task scope. Finally, addressing the potential contamination of training and test sets through task clustering would strengthen the experimental setup and findings.
