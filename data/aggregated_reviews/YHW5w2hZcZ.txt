### Key Points
This paper presents the Multi-scenario Video Anomaly Event Extraction and Localization Task (M-VAE) and introduces Sherlock, a large language model for video anomaly detection. The proposed method aims to extract semantic information from videos, addressing challenges in combining global and local spatial features through a Global-local Spatial-enhanced MoE module and a Spatial Imbalance Regulator. The authors also construct a dataset that includes semantic and spatial information of abnormal video records, demonstrating the effectiveness of Sherlock to some extent.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed task is novel and practical, with potential applications in home security and online video content detection.
- The constructed dataset is significant for advancing research in this area.

Weaknesses:
- The method lacks novelty, resembling an engineering solution that integrates existing techniques without substantial innovation.
- The model's complexity may lead to high inference latency, affecting its practicality.
- Some techniques used are empirically driven and lack theoretical support.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing more detailed visualizations and examples to aid understanding, particularly regarding spatial information processing. Additionally, a more thorough comparison with existing datasets and tasks should be included to articulate the originality of the M-VAE task and dataset. The authors should also address the potential for overfitting due to increased model complexity and provide a detailed analysis of the training and inference times for each method. Furthermore, we suggest including a discussion on the computing resources required for practical implementation and the difficulties of integrating the model with existing monitoring systems. Lastly, a theoretical analysis supporting the loss used for balancing spatial information should be added, along with a clearer explanation of the features utilized in the model.
