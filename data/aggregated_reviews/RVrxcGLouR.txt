### Key Points
This paper presents MultiContrievers, initialized from various MultiBert checkpoints, to investigate how specific information, such as gender and occupation, is encoded in dense representations and the effectiveness of its extraction. The study compares the information captured by dense retriever systems and their underlying language models, utilizing 25 different MultiBert checkpoints and employing minimum description length as a probing tool. The findings indicate that MultiContrievers exhibit higher extractability than MultiBert, although their performance on tasks like NQ and MSMARCO does not correlate with extractability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well written and easy to understand, with a clear focus on research questions supported by in-depth experiments.
- It provides unique insights into the encoding of information in dense representations and is the first to analyze dense retriever vector representations.
- Extensive discussion and analysis of experimental results, with MultiContriever checkpoints potentially useful for future interpretability work.

Weaknesses:
- Experiments could benefit from exploring additional categories beyond gender and occupation for a more comprehensive assessment.
- The analysis may not hold for recent dense retrieval models, raising questions about the sensitivity of other models to initialization and shuffling.
- Figure 4 is too small and difficult to read, and the definition of 'allocational fairness' is unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental focus by including additional categories beyond gender and occupation. It would also be beneficial to address the applicability of their findings to recent dense retrieval models, potentially providing directions for future work on this topic. Additionally, we suggest enhancing Figure 4 for better readability and clarifying the definition of 'allocational fairness' in the text.
