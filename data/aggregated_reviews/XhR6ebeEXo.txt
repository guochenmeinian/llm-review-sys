### Key Points
This paper presents MeTaCo-XMT, a meta-task collector-based cross-lingual meta-transfer framework for data selection in meta-transfer learning. The authors propose a syntactic distance metric model that includes a syntactic encoder block based on pre-trained models and a distance metric block utilizing Word Moverâ€™s Distance. The experiments validate the framework on WikiAnn and TydiQA, demonstrating improved results compared to previous methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is intuitive and effective, with clear writing and comprehensive experiments supporting the claims.
- The framework emphasizes syntactic distance over semantic similarity, which is a novel contribution.
- The empirical results indicate that MeTaCo-XMT outperforms comparable frameworks.

Weaknesses:
- The analysis primarily focuses on NER tasks, lacking depth in other areas such as MRC.
- The presentation requires improvement, particularly in the clarity of results and the use of excessively small fonts in tables.
- There are inconsistencies in bibliography reference styles and various notational ambiguities that need clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis in Section 6 to include more in-depth discussions on MRC tasks. Additionally, enhancing the presentation of results, especially by addressing the small font sizes in tables, would significantly benefit clarity. We also suggest that the authors clarify the notations used in the paper, particularly for $x$, $x^d$, and $x^c$, to avoid confusion. Furthermore, releasing the code for replication purposes would enhance the reproducibility of the results. Lastly, consider exploring the application of the framework to other monolingual few-shot knowledge transfer tasks to broaden its applicability.
