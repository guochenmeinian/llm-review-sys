Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the mixture weight estimation problem within the context of Multi-source Multi-target Domain Adaptation (M2DA) and proposes a method for domain adaptation that optimizes to minimize the generalization bound. The authors formulate the mixture weight estimation as a compositional convex-concave minimax optimization problem and introduce a stochastic descent ascent algorithm to address it. They explore efficient empirical risk minimization (ERM) for multiple target domains in both offline and online settings. The paper emphasizes theoretical contributions, including convergence analysis of the proposed algorithms, and demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy on the Office dataset, achieving 91.25% accuracy on Amazon and 90% on Webcam. However, it lacks comprehensive empirical validation across various settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of the proposed optimization algorithm and addresses both offline and online settings.
- It identifies an important instance of a convex-nonconcave minimax problem, contributing to the broader optimization literature.
- The proposed methods are supported by provable guarantees, enhancing their theoretical rigor.
- Experimental results on the Office dataset show substantial performance gains, with the proposed method achieving high accuracy compared to average empirical risk minimization (ERM) and pure target training.

Weaknesses:
- The focus on theoretical analysis overshadows practical applications, as there are no experimental results to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in the context of mixture weight estimation.
- The connection between the mixture weight optimization and model weight prediction is weak, suggesting that these could be better addressed as separate papers.
- The complexity of the proposed methods may hinder their implementation for practitioners unfamiliar with advanced techniques.
- The current submission includes only partial results due to time constraints, limiting the comprehensiveness of the findings, and additional target settings and ResNet results are not yet provided.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical validation of their methods by including experiments on real datasets to demonstrate practical effectiveness, particularly for the mixture weight estimation problem. Additionally, clarifying the connection between the mixture weight optimization and model weight prediction could strengthen the paper's coherence. We suggest revising the presentation to focus more on the theoretical contributions relevant to the convex-nonconcave minimax problem while ensuring that sufficient experimental results are included in the main content. Furthermore, addressing the potential overfitting issues related to the bounds in Theorem 1 and discussing the influence of errors in weight estimation would enhance the robustness of the findings. Lastly, we recommend that the authors enhance the comprehensiveness of their results by including additional target settings and ResNet results in the revised version.
