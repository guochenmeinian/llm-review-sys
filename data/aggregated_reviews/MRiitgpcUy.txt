Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a bidirectional two-sample test that enhances sensitivity by addressing both positive and negative gaps between samples, based on Hotelling's statistic. The authors propose encoding direction information through mean differences, utilizing an adequate Mahalanobis kernel, and focusing on local inference to improve testing power compared to baseline methods. The test's applicability is emphasized in experimental design and observational studies, particularly when global differences are minimal but local differences are substantial. Additionally, the authors introduce a bi-directional hypothesis aimed at enhancing the sensitivity of two-sample tests by considering two discriminative directions, clarifying the lineage of concepts from prior works, including the non-directional hypothesis proposed by Kaiser (1960) and the one-directional hypothesis. They also introduce the "bi-directional masked p-value" to reflect local differences and improve multiple hypothesis testing power.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- **Originality**: The proposed test and bi-directional hypothesis introduce novel approaches to two-sample testing.  
- **Quality**: The authors demonstrate thorough efforts in delivering theorems and conducting extensive experiments to validate their test.  
- **Clarity**: The paper is generally clear in structure and writing, though there are areas for improvement.  
- **Significance**: The test has broad applications in various fields, particularly in identifying local significant differences.  
- The authors provide a clear lineage of the concepts discussed, referencing foundational works in the field.

Weaknesses:  
- **Tradeoff**: The paper does not adequately address the tradeoff between local differences and overall sample complexity, as the sample complexity for local tests is typically lower than for global tests.  
- **Clarity**: The region-splitting method lacks pictorial illustrations, making it difficult to understand. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a formal problem formulation section to clarify the null and alternative hypotheses.  
- **Design Elements**: The contributions of specific design elements (e.g., bi-directional p-values, tree partition) to the algorithm's performance are unclear, and certain assumptions in theorems are not well-explained. There is also ambiguity regarding the distinctiveness and utility of the "bi-directional masked p-value" outside this context.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by including pictorial illustrations of the region-splitting method and providing a formal problem formulation section. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the contributions of the design elements to the algorithm's performance, particularly regarding the necessity of bi-directional p-values, tree partition, and kernel design. Furthermore, addressing the tradeoff between local differences and sample complexity analytically would strengthen the paper. We also encourage the authors to ensure that the usefulness of the "bi-directional masked p-value" is articulated more clearly to enhance its perceived value beyond this work. Finally, we suggest considering renaming the "bi-directional hypothesis for testing" to better reflect its focus on custom rejection regions.
