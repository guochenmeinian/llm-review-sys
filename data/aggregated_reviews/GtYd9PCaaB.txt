Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the SR-CACO-2 dataset, a large-scale confocal microscopy dataset designed for super-resolution tasks, consisting of 9937 paired low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) images across three protein markers. The authors benchmark 15 state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, revealing that these models struggle to produce high-quality reconstructions. The dataset aims to facilitate the development of deep learning architectures for real-world applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The construction of a dataset specifically tailored for confocal fluorescence microscopy SISR is a significant contribution.
- The evaluation of SOTA methods provides valuable insights into their performance on real experimental data.
- The dataset is well-documented and accessible, enhancing its utility for the research community.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset's limited size and diversity, originating from only 22 tiles, may not adequately represent the variability needed for real biological experiments.
- The evaluation lacks comparisons with real-world SISR methods and conventional iterative solvers, which could provide a more comprehensive assessment.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors enhance the motivation behind the work by addressing the challenges of real-world super-resolution, particularly the degradation gap between synthetic and real-world kernels. Additionally, the authors should clarify the dataset's diversity and statistical information, potentially referencing the RealVSR dataset for insights. It would also be beneficial to explore the dataset's impact on downstream tasks and compare their findings with similar studies in the field. Finally, making the dataset truly open and publicly accessible without restrictions would significantly benefit the research community.
