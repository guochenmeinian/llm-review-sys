Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for accelerating the inference process in denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) by optimizing the balance between the number and complexity of sampling subproblems. The authors propose the Reverse Transition Kernel (RTK) framework, which allows for a more efficient decomposition of the denoising diffusion process, leveraging advanced sampling algorithms like the Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA) and Underdamped Langevin Dynamics (ULD). Theoretical convergence guarantees for these algorithms are provided, surpassing current state-of-the-art rates for diffusion inference.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed RTK framework enables a more efficient decomposition of the denoising diffusion process, improving convergence rates and providing robust theoretical guarantees.
- The paper presents a compelling argument for accelerating the inference of reverse SDE, which is more interesting than previous attempts using specialized SDE solvers.
- The theoretical analysis is detailed, addressing both SDE discretization errors and sampling errors from Metropolis-Hastings techniques.

Weaknesses:
- The manuscript lacks sufficient numerical evaluation to thoroughly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, particularly in comparison to existing inference methods.
- There are minor confounding statements and small mistakes in the writing, such as the confusing use of "Gaussian process" instead of "Gaussian approximation."
- The choice of step size is critical, and the paper does not provide a clear analysis of its impact on computational complexity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of terminology, particularly by replacing "Gaussian process" with "Gaussian approximation" where appropriate. Additionally, we suggest that the authors include the numerical experiments in the main body of the text to better demonstrate the effectiveness of their method. Clarifying the use of the $ \tilde{\mathcal{O}} $ notation and providing a more concrete analysis of the step size choice in terms of computational complexity would enhance the paper's clarity and generality. Finally, addressing the practical implications of the RTK framework for other generative models could broaden the paper's impact.
