### Key Points
This paper presents the DRP (Disentangled Relevance and Preference) framework, which addresses the collapsed modeling space issue in e-commerce search by disentangling user preferences from query-item relevance. The authors propose using Preference Editing and Dual-Level Adaptive Fusion to enhance behavior modeling. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate DRP's effectiveness in predictive accuracy and ranking tasks without relying on human-labeled data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a clear analysis of the collapsed modeling space issue using causal graphs and Venn diagrams.
- The proposed methods effectively disentangle relevance from preference and offer nuanced behavior modeling.
- Extensive experiments validate the framework's performance across different datasets, showcasing its robustness.
- The independence from human-labeled data enhances applicability to diverse e-commerce platforms.

Weaknesses:
- The mathematical descriptions of Preference Editing and Adaptive Fusion may be too dense for some readers.
- The selection of baselines for comparison is limited, lacking a broader spectrum of recent approaches.
- The paper does not quantify DRPâ€™s scalability or computational efficiency, which is crucial for real-time applications.
- Ethical implications regarding potential biases in recommendation systems are not addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors simplify or supplement the mathematical formulations with intuitive examples to aid understanding. Additionally, including a broader range of state-of-the-art models that tackle similar challenges would strengthen the paper. It is essential to report computational costs, training times, and inference latencies to assess DRP's feasibility in large-scale environments. Finally, discussing potential biases in the reconstructed modeling spaces and providing strategies to mitigate adverse impacts would enhance the paper's depth.
