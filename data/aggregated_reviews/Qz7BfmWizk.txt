### Key Points
This paper presents a formulation of goal-directed navigation as a Lie group operator search problem, proposing a 2-layer neural network that mimics the neural circuits of Drosophila responsible for such navigation. The authors argue that their framework connects group-theoretical perspectives with planning systems in artificial agents and biological circuits. They demonstrate the utility of their framework through a 1D rotation group of actions, suggesting that it is computationally simpler than traditional signal processing algorithms. Additionally, the paper extends the neural model to 2D scenarios, achieving motion planning in a 2D environment through the addition of four groups of neurons for directional targeting. The authors show that the model can infer velocities proportional to the differential firing of DN neurons along the north-south and east-west axes. They also address the challenge of reconciling translation symmetry with the non-uniform distribution of neurons on the stimulus manifold, proposing that symmetry breaking can help explain the effective functioning of the system despite this non-uniformity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The theoretical approach to motor planning is intriguing, with a plausible neural network implementation that aligns with Drosophila's navigation circuits.  
- The mathematical formulation appears sound, and the authors exhibit a strong grasp of the relevant tools.  
- The study is well-structured and connects group-theory principles to planning systems, providing a thorough introduction to the theoretical framework.  
- The extension to 2D scenarios is well-articulated, showing promise for motion planning applications.  
- The authors provide a thorough discussion of the implications of non-uniform neuron distribution, highlighting its relevance to biological systems.  
- The paper opens avenues for further exploration at the intersection of group symmetry and neural circuits.

Weaknesses:  
- The exposition quality is poor, making the paper difficult to read; design choices lack motivation, and results are presented confusingly.  
- The model's assumption that the motor system generates actions through translation and rotation is not well justified.  
- The numerical simulations are limited, providing insufficient detail to evaluate the correctness of the experiments.  
- The disconnect between the abstract introduction and the specific results on the 1D system raises questions about the generalizability of the framework.  
- The lack of figures for the 2D simulations limits comprehension of the results.  
- Concerns remain regarding the generalizability of the framework to various biological systems and its applicability to artificial agents.  
- The theoretical extensions required for non-uniform distributions are acknowledged but not fully resolved.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the exposition by better motivating design choices and providing clearer presentations of results. Specifically, justifying the assumption that the motor system generates actions through translation and rotation is essential. Additionally, we suggest expanding the description of numerical simulations to allow for a more thorough evaluation of their correctness. Addressing the limitations of the framework's applicability to higher-dimensional systems and non-uniform coding would also strengthen the paper. We further recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their framework's scope by explicitly stating its applicability to goal-directed navigation in 2D mazes in the introduction. Including figures of the 2D simulations in the appendix would enhance comprehension of the results. To address concerns about generalizability, we suggest the authors provide more concrete examples or case studies demonstrating the framework's application to different biological systems and artificial agents.
