Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DEVIL, a novel evaluation protocol for text-to-video (T2V) generation that emphasizes the dynamics of video content, which are often overlooked in existing metrics. The authors propose a set of dynamics scores based on multiple temporal granularities and create a benchmark of text prompts graded by dynamics levels. The study demonstrates that DEVIL achieves up to 90% consistency with human evaluations, indicating its potential to enhance T2V model assessments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of new dynamics metrics enhances the evaluation of T2V models, focusing on visual vividness and fidelity to text prompts.
2. A thorough comparative analysis with existing methods highlights their limitations in addressing video dynamics, showcasing the advantages of the proposed metrics.
3. The authors submitted their code, promoting reproducibility and innovation within the community.

Weaknesses:
1. Evaluating dynamics solely through images is challenging; providing real video examples with corresponding scores would improve assessment accuracy.
2. The segmentation method for calculating Inter-segment Dynamics Score is overly simplistic, potentially misaligning with actual semantic segments.
3. The computational efficiency of the proposed metrics is not adequately addressed, raising concerns about practical applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including real video examples alongside their corresponding dynamics scores to better illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed metrics. Additionally, a direct comparison between the proposed metrics and existing dynamics metrics, such as those in EvalCrafter, should be conducted. The authors should also refine the segmentation approach for the Inter-segment Dynamics Score to ensure it aligns more closely with semantic segments. Furthermore, addressing the computational efficiency of the proposed metrics in the camera-ready version would enhance understanding of their practical utility.
