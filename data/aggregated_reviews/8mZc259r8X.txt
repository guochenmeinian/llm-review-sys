### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of the interplay between learning theory and the branch-and-cut algorithm for solving mixed-integer programs (MIPs), focusing on cut selection. The authors propose a parameterization of cut-generating functions to minimize the number of branch-and-bound nodes created by the solver. They establish three criteria for selecting a cut-generating function: efficient computation of cutting planes, provable sample complexity bounds, and demonstration of superior performance compared to classical cuts. The authors prove sample complexity bounds for different settings and conduct numerical experiments comparing their cut-generating functions against classical GMI cuts, particularly in knapsack and partition problems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-structured and easy to read.  
- The provided code enables reproducibility of nearly all experiments.  

Weaknesses:  
- There is insufficient empirical evidence supporting strong claims about the Gomory and Johnson [2003] cut-generating functions, particularly regarding their performance compared to classical cuts.  
- The only classical baseline tested is GMI cuts, which limits the generalizability of the findings.  
- The instances used for experiments may not provide significant insights due to their simplicity and the specific settings employed.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical evidence supporting claims about the Gomory and Johnson [2003] cut-generating functions, ensuring that the performance comparisons are robust and include a wider range of classical cuts. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the generation of instances, particularly the distinction between the parameters used in their study and those in Chv√°tal's work. It would be beneficial to enhance the connection between the computational study and the theoretical aspects of the paper, particularly in Section 5. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide a more detailed discussion of limitations and potential future work stemming from their findings.
