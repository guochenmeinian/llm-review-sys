Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for detecting out-of-context (OOC) mis- and disinformation by utilizing a stance extraction network (SEN) that processes both textual and visual evidence. The authors propose a comprehensive approach that incorporates a support-refutation score based on co-occurrence relations of named entities, enhancing the interpretability and robustness of the method. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of this framework through rigorous empirical testing on the NewsCLIPpings dataset, showing a performance improvement of 3.2% over existing state-of-the-art techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a critical social issue related to online misinformation.
- The methodology is sound, with thorough analyses supporting the model's capabilities.
- The proposed framework effectively integrates multimodal evidence and provides interpretability.
- The inclusion of code for reproducibility is commendable.

Weaknesses:
- The writing is dense and at times difficult to follow.
- Some comparisons, particularly with the CLIP approach, are unclear and may misrepresent model performance.
- The explanation of the two-sample one-tail z-test is insufficient.
- The sampling method for training data lacks clarity, potentially affecting evaluation outcomes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing to enhance readability and understanding. Specifically, ensure that comparisons with existing models, such as CLIP, are accurately represented and clearly articulated. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed explanation of the two-sample one-tail z-test and clarifying the sampling methodology used for training data. Finally, we advise the authors to address the distinction between misinformation and disinformation more explicitly, potentially consolidating terminology for consistency.
