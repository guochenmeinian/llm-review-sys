### Key Points
This paper presents a novel problem of identifying the densest subgraph under specific constraints related to colored edges, defining variants that require at least, exactly, or at most h edges of a given color. The authors prove the NP-completeness of these problems and propose a linear-time constant-factor approximation algorithm for sparse graphs. The empirical evaluation demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness across various real-world networks, achieving high accuracy in solving instances of the proposed problems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a clearly defined new problem and provides a thorough theoretical analysis of its complexity.
- It presents several algorithmic solutions with a constant approximation factor.
- The empirical evaluation includes a detailed quantitative study across multiple datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The practical applicability of the proposed formulation compared to existing methods is unclear, with insufficient convincing examples.
- The approximation factor's performance in large graphs remains unexamined, necessitating theoretical exploration.
- Qualitative results are lacking; specific examples of interesting subgraphs identified by the method are not provided.
- The treatment of the "exactly h_i" and "at most h_i" problems is insufficiently detailed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the real-world applicability of their methods by providing concrete examples that demonstrate their relevance compared to existing approaches, such as multilayer graph formulations. Additionally, we suggest identifying the approximation factor or establishing an upper bound for it in large graphs. It would also be beneficial to include examples of interesting subgraphs identified by the proposed approach that are not captured by existing methods. Furthermore, the authors should enhance the discussion on the assumptions regarding everywhere sparse graphs and clarify the handling of multi-edge graphs in Section 4.3. Lastly, improving the presentation by standardizing abbreviations and increasing the font size of tables and figures would enhance readability.
