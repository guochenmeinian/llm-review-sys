### Key Points
This paper presents a decoding intervention framework aimed at enhancing the sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) approach for grammatical error correction (GEC). The authors propose using an external critic model to dynamically evaluate and influence the next token generated by the GEC model during decoding, investigating two types of critics: a pre-trained left-to-right language model and an incremental target-side grammatical error detector. The experiments conducted on English and Chinese GEC datasets demonstrate that this framework can significantly improve GEC model performance, achieving results competitive with state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed GEC model shows comparable performance to state-of-the-art models across all datasets.  
- The paper includes extensive ablative experiments that explore the effects of different model sizes and coefficients, adding depth to the study.  
- The implementation of the proposed interventions is well-documented and the paper is clearly written.  

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty of the approach is questionable, as the use of a language model as a critic has been previously explored.  
- The motivation behind the design of the lambda formula is unclear and requires further elaboration.  
- The dynamic coefficient may lead to a decline in precision and recall, raising concerns about robustness.  
- The improvement from gpt2-large to gpt2-xl is not significant, casting doubt on the benefits of stronger language models.  
- The added complexity of incorporating a critic may increase decoding time, and the practical utility of this approach remains uncertain.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind the lambda formula to enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest that the authors treat Beta as a static coefficient to improve consistency. To strengthen the paper's contribution, it would be beneficial to emphasize the novel aspects of the approach more clearly. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to conduct experiments comparing the performance of a larger GEC model against the proposed method to justify the practical value of adding a GED critic. Lastly, addressing the concerns regarding the model's inference speed and its implications for practical applications would be valuable.
