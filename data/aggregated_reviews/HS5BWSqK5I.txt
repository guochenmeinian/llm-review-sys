### Key Points
This paper presents a derivative-free optimization method called Cross-Task Prompt Tuning (CTPT) aimed at enhancing sample and computational efficiency in few-shot conversational emotion recognition. The authors propose leveraging sharable cross-task knowledge to improve learning performance, while maintaining low intrinsic dimensionality and requiring minimal optimization parameters. The manuscript claims to achieve recognition quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods, despite the challenges posed by the few-shot learning paradigm.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is derivative-free and requires few parameters to optimize.
- Extensive experimental results convincingly support the claimed contributions.
- The approach is training-efficient and achieves high recognition quality.

Weaknesses:
- The significance of emotional knowledge in the model remains unclear, raising questions about the model's performance.
- The abstract lacks convincing rationale for the choice of few-shot learning, given the abundance of conversational data.
- The motivation for the study is ambiguous and lacks sufficient theoretical support.
- The contribution of the paper is difficult to follow, particularly regarding its novelty in the few-shot learning context.
- Performance is reported to be inferior to zero-shot models like ChatGPT.
- Figure quality and the need for significance tests in experimental results are noted as areas for improvement.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the abstract by providing a more comprehensive justification for the choice of few-shot learning in the context of abundant conversational data. Additionally, the authors should clearly articulate the research objectives and significance in the introduction, supported by relevant literature. It is essential to explain the advantages of their approach compared to existing methods and to address the ambiguity surrounding the significance of emotional knowledge in the model. We also suggest enhancing the quality of figures and conducting significance tests for the experimental results to verify their reliability. Lastly, incorporating error analysis would strengthen the overall findings of the study.
