### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach using Processing-using-Commercial-DRAM (PuCD) to implement the POPCOUNT operation with high parallelism. The authors introduce the POPCNT3 operation, analogous to a full adder, producing a 2-bit result through MAX3 and MAX5 computations. They further decompose the generic POPCOUNT operation into multiple POPCNT3 operations, achieving impressive throughputs of up to 47TB/s on an FPGA, significantly surpassing the A100 GPU's 0.136TB/s for the POPCNT7 operation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed method is innovative and addresses the challenge of processing-in-memory accumulation effectively.  
- The authors demonstrate a substantial throughput improvement of 27-348x over the A100 GPU.  
- The paper is well-written, with clear illustrations that enhance reader understanding.  

Weaknesses:  
- The accumulation is limited to a subarray, raising questions about its applicability in broader contexts, such as machine learning.  
- Latency comparisons could be more accessible by providing familiar terms for those outside the field.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the implementation by exploring the integration of binary neural networks, where XNOR gates replace multiplications and accumulations utilize POPCOUNT. Additionally, consider addressing the importance of subarray accumulation in machine learning contexts and whether the proposed method can facilitate accumulation across multiple subarrays. Finally, we suggest providing latency comparisons in more familiar terms, such as the latency of adding two 32-bit or 16-bit precision numbers using the proposed method.
