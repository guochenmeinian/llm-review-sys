### Key Points
This paper presents an analytic exploration of visual deceptions in cryptocurrency wallets, detailing their mechanisms and detection methodologies. The authors identify approximately 24 million scam incidents, resulting in over 27 million USD in losses, and conduct a measurement study of the cryptocurrency scam ecosystem. The research focuses on three specific types of visual scams, including counterfeit token scams and function name scams, while proposing mitigation strategies based on their findings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a substantial measurement study with a large dataset of over 24 million scam incidents.
- It effectively categorizes various types of attacks and offers detailed insights into the visual scam ecosystem.
- The authors propose mitigation approaches based on their findings, contributing to the understanding of this emerging issue.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a clear definition of the threat model for each type of visual scam, particularly regarding the attack methods.
- There is insufficient analysis of potential false positives and false negatives in the detection techniques.
- The validation process for detected results is not convincing, with a small sample size and inadequate explanation of precision validation standards.
- Some sections, such as the description of 'combo forgery' detection and the campaign analysis, require further detail and clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the threat model by providing detailed descriptions of the attack methods for each scam type. Additionally, please include a discussion on the risk of false positives and negatives in the detection techniques, particularly for the counterfeit token scam and zero-transfer scam. A more rigorous validation process is necessary to enhance the credibility of the measurement study's findings.

Furthermore, we suggest elaborating on the criteria for selecting misleading function names and including a complete list of these names. Clarifying the rationale behind the exclusion of revenue estimations for counterfeit tokens and addressing presentation issues, such as the terms "phony effect" and "elusive semantics," will also improve the paper's clarity. Lastly, integrating references to relevant figures and providing a clearer methodology for scam type analysis will enhance the overall coherence of the paper.
