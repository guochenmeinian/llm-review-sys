Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new method within the Bayesian algorithm execution framework, specifically a scalable posterior sampling algorithm (PS-BAX). The authors propose that PS-BAX efficiently identifies a target set of points by computing the target set using a sampled function from a posterior of Gaussian processes and selecting the point with the highest posterior variance. The method shows superior computational efficiency compared to prior work, particularly INFO-BAX, and claims asymptotic consistency under the assumption of a stable target set. Additionally, PS-BAX samples points by maximizing entropy and is asserted to be significantly faster and more robust than the Info-BAX method published in 2021. The paper includes a clear comparison between these methods and combines theoretical proofs with benchmarks based on real-world problems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem addressed is significant and relevant.
- The proposed method demonstrates soundness and strong improvements in speed and sometimes accuracy against benchmarks.
- The paper is well-structured and validated through extensive experiments.
- The paper is clearly written and pleasant to read.
- The bibliographical work and contextualization are well-executed.
- A concise comparison between PS-BAX and Info-BAX highlights the advantages of the new method.
- The combination of theoretical proofs with practical benchmarks is commendable.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical justification, particularly regarding the consistency proof, is questioned, with concerns about the notation and assumptions made.
- The paper is seen as incremental over INFO-BAX, lacking rigorous development on its connection to that method.
- The algorithm's efficiency in high-dimensional scenarios is not convincingly demonstrated, and the choice of selecting points based on entropy may not be universally optimal.
- The paper lacks clarity in certain areas, including grammar issues and incomplete sentences.
- The relationship between PS-BAX and existing methods, such as uncertainty sampling and Thompson sampling, is not sufficiently elaborated.
- The necessity of a local optimization experiment on a single target function is questionable.
- Figure 2 could be clearer, and legends for the Y axis and explanations for acronyms like EI and LSE are missing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the theoretical justification, particularly in Theorem 1, by addressing the notation and assumptions more explicitly. Additionally, the authors should discuss more limitations of the method beyond its applicability to algorithms with a set of points as targets. It would be beneficial to justify the scalability of PS-BAX to high-dimensional problems with numerical experiments. Furthermore, consider providing more details on how PS-BAX can be parallelized, as the current description suggests sequential computation. Lastly, the authors should clarify the implications of the finiteness assumption in their results and explore its relevance in broader applications. We also recommend that the authors address grammar issues and incomplete sentences to enhance clarity. Specifically, they should clarify what is meant by "faster" in the context of PS-BAX and elaborate on its connections with existing methods, particularly uncertainty sampling and Thompson sampling. Additionally, we suggest reconsidering the necessity of the local optimization experiment and enhancing the clarity of Figure 2 by including legends on the Y axis and definitions for acronyms like EI and LSE.
