Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Channel Clustering Module (CCM), a novel approach designed to enhance time series forecasting models by dynamically clustering channels based on intrinsic similarities. CCM effectively balances individual channel treatment with essential cross-channel dependencies, leading to improved forecasting performance. The authors demonstrate CCM's adaptability across various time series models through extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets, showcasing its ability to facilitate zero-shot forecasting and improve interpretability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The originality of CCM lies in its innovative approach to channel clustering, addressing limitations of existing Channel-Independent (CI) and Channel-Dependent (CD) strategies.
- The experiments are well-designed, clearly presenting results that demonstrate CCM's effectiveness across different datasets and models.
- The paper is well-written, enhancing readability and understanding of the methodology and results.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks detailed discussions on the selection of similarity metrics and the impact of hyperparameters on performance.
- The computational efficiency of CCM, particularly in large-scale applications, is not thoroughly addressed, raising concerns about scalability and overhead.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the selection of similarity metrics and their impact on performance. Additionally, a more comprehensive analysis of the computational efficiency of CCM, particularly in large-scale applications, should be included. We also suggest providing the official code for reproducibility and conducting a hyperparameter analysis for the parameter Î² to demonstrate its impact on model performance. Furthermore, addressing the increased model complexity introduced by CCM, especially regarding the number of Feed Forward layers, would enhance the paper's clarity.
