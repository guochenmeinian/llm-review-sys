Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a semi-dual formulation of unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) for generative modeling, demonstrating its advantages through experiments on image datasets. The authors claim that their method exhibits outlier robustness, stability, and faster convergence compared to existing optimal transport methods. Theoretical upper bounds on divergences between marginals are also provided. Additionally, the authors propose a novel approach to generative modeling using optimal transport maps (OTM), emphasizing the advantages of OT-based models over traditional GANs, particularly in terms of stable convergence and reduced mode collapse. They address various technical aspects, including the implementation of the UOTM model, the definition of the cost function, and the proof of Theorem A4, which establishes strong duality under certain conditions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors have conducted extensive experiments, including comparisons with various methods and an ablation study, demonstrating promising practical results and theoretical advancements in generative modeling.
- The literature review is thorough, and the proposed UOTM shows promising results on standard datasets, indicating its potential as an efficient generative modeling method.
- The authors have effectively addressed previous concerns and clarified key theoretical results during the rebuttal process, strengthening the theoretical contributions and experimental rigor.

Weaknesses:
- The work appears to be a direct implementation of existing methods with no significant improvements, leading to an incremental contribution.
- Theoretical results, particularly Theorem 3.3 and the proof of Theorem A4, are questioned for correctness and lack mathematical rigor, raising concerns about the validity of the proposed algorithm.
- Some comparisons with existing models, such as OTM, lack clarity regarding the parameters used, making it difficult to assess fairness, and comparisons with certain relevant methods, such as [76], are missing.
- The clarity of experimental evaluations is insufficient, and there are unresolved questions regarding the definitions of variables in the cost function.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical rigor of their results, particularly by providing a more detailed justification for Theorem 3.3 and enhancing the proof of Theorem A4 to address the informal aspects noted in the reviews. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with unbalanced-based methods like [8] or [17] and clarifying the parameters used in comparisons with OTM to strengthen the discussion on robustness and fairness. The authors should also clarify the experimental setup, including the application of their method to generative modeling and the derivation of results in Table 1. Furthermore, adding a background section on first variations in functional spaces would provide readers with necessary context. Lastly, addressing minor presentation issues, such as improving figure captions, ensuring all figures are referenced in the text, and maintaining consistency in the descriptions of the Gaussian noise tensor and the images throughout the manuscript, would enhance the overall clarity of the paper.
