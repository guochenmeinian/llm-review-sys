### Key Points
This paper presents a study of smooth games, focusing on the convergence properties of no-regret dynamics in $(\lambda,\mu)$-smooth games and a framework for analyzing multi-player games with Lipschitz utility functions. The authors demonstrate that when the robust price of anarchy (rPoA) is lower bounded by $1-\epsilon$, and players utilize the optimistic gradient descent (OGD) algorithm, the best iterate converges to a $(\sqrt{\epsilon}/\sqrt{\delta n}, \delta)$ weak Nash equilibrium. They also show that under certain conditions, Clairvoyant Gradient Descent (CGD) can yield better social welfare guarantees. Additionally, the authors propose a method for players to determine their best response gaps and communicate this information to a central coordinator, facilitating the termination of the game process. The work connects smoothness arguments to the efficiency of Nash equilibria and the tractability of computing these equilibria, while also discussing the implications of truthfulness in reporting and the role of a central coordinator in decision-making.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides significant insights into the convergence of OGD in smooth games, establishing a solid contribution to the field.
- The results reveal an interesting phase transition in computational complexity related to equilibrium computation, particularly for games with PoA = 1.
- The authors effectively unify findings from two-player zero-sum games and offer new perspectives on the Minty property.
- The authors provide a clear mathematical framework for understanding the behavior of players in multi-player games.
- The proposed communication model is efficient, requiring only a single bit of information per player per iteration.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation behind studying games with $rPoA \geq 1-\epsilon$ is unclear, appearing more as a technical assumption than an interesting class of games.
- The trackability of rPoA is questioned, as its computation can be intractable for large player counts.
- Several notational issues exist, such as the use of superscripts that could be misleading and unclear definitions in Observation 3.3.
- The comparison between the authors' results and those of Roughgarden et al. lacks clarity, particularly regarding the distinction between best-iterate and time-average payoffs.
- The reliance on a central coordinator raises concerns about truthfulness in reporting, as players may have incentives to misreport their best response gaps.
- The model does not address the issue of exploitability in learning dynamics, which could be a significant oversight.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for the class of games with $rPoA \geq 1-\epsilon$ by providing examples of previously studied games or real applications that satisfy this condition. Additionally, clarifying the computational tractability of rPoA in large games would enhance the paper's impact. We suggest revising the notations for clarity, particularly replacing superscripts with clearer distinctions and ensuring consistent definitions throughout. Furthermore, an expanded discussion comparing the results with those of Roughgarden et al. would provide necessary context and strengthen the paper's contributions. We also recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the implications of truthfulness in their model, particularly regarding the incentives for players to misreport their gaps. Lastly, addressing the issue of exploitability more thoroughly would be beneficial, as this is a critical aspect of the learning dynamics in game theory.
