Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method to regularize the nuclear norm of the Jacobian of a function, particularly in the context of neural networks. The authors reference prior work to formulate nuclear norm regularization without SVD computation, leading to a novel result that the nuclear norm of the Jacobian \( Jf \) of a composite function \( f = g \circ h \) equals the average of the squared Frobenius norms of \( Jg \) and \( Jh \). This method is computationally efficient, validated against a known closed-form solution, and demonstrated in applications such as unsupervised denoising and representation learning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors’ key finding regarding the Jacobian of a composite function is original and significant.
- The paper is clear, well-written, and provides a good summary of background information.
- The authors effectively distinguish their contributions from prior art.
- Validation and application examples convincingly demonstrate the proposed method’s efficacy.
- The experiments appear reproducible.

Weaknesses:
- In the representation learning application, efficacy is shown on a single image; quantifying performance over a full dataset would be beneficial.
- The authors should address two references that compute nuclear norm without SVD, clarifying their relevance.
- Figure 1 lacks axis labels; the authors should confirm the axes correspond to input coordinates.
- The claim in Figure 3's caption should be moderated to "nearly identical" to avoid confusion.
- Subsection titles in Section 5 need clearer formatting to distinguish application examples from other content.
- The PSNR values in Table 1 are based on only 100 images; repeating the experiment with more images is recommended.
- The order of methods in Table 1 and Figure 4 should be consistent.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the representation learning application by quantifying performance across a complete test dataset. Additionally, please address the two references on nuclear norm computation without SVD in the manuscript. Confirm and explicitly state the axes in Figure 1 correspond to input coordinates. In Figure 3, consider revising the claim to "nearly identical" to align with the main text. We suggest reformatting subsection titles in Section 5 for clarity. Please repeat the PSNR experiment using a larger dataset and ensure the order of methods in Table 1 and Figure 4 matches.
