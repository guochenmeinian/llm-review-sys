Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a multi-objective Bayesian optimization approach for molecular generation using GFlowNets, specifically leveraging a hyper-network-based parameterization to incorporate preference weights. The authors propose a preference-based decomposition and utilize a hindsight-experience replay strategy to enhance sample efficiency. The hyper-network-based GFlowNet serves as an acquisition function optimizer to identify a diverse set of molecules along the empirical Pareto front.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant topic in multi-objective optimization for molecular design.
- Experimental results are strong, demonstrating the method's potential.
- The combination of existing techniques is original, with comprehensive benchmarks and an ablation study.
- The writing is generally clear, and the problem is well-contextualized.

Weaknesses:
- The distinction between this work and the Pareto GFlowNet is not clearly articulated.
- The training process and stability of the hyper-network remain unclear.
- The necessity of the surrogate model is not well justified; it is uncertain whether the GFlowNet can independently propose diverse candidates.
- The evaluation is limited to a single problem, and there is a lack of discussion on the impact of batch size on optimization performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how the hyper-network is trained and its stability. Additionally, it would be beneficial to explicitly discuss the role of the surrogate model and whether the GFlowNet can function independently. We suggest providing more diverse experimental evaluations across different benchmark problems to demonstrate the general applicability of the HN-GFN. Furthermore, a clearer explanation of the batch size choice and its implications on the optimization process would enhance the paper's robustness.
