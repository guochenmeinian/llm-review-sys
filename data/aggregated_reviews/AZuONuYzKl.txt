### Key Points
This paper presents HComP-Net, a novel deep learning algorithm designed to identify evolutionary traits common to species with shared ancestors. The authors propose new architectures and loss functions to mitigate over-specification issues prevalent in existing methods. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments and ablation studies, showing improvements in accuracy and generalizability to unseen species.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
+ The introduction of HComP-Net allows for hierarchical discovery of evolutionary traits, addressing limitations of current prototype-based methods.  
+ The combination of novel loss functions and a masking module enhances performance by excluding over-specific prototypes without sacrificing classification accuracy.  
+ The results indicate strong learning capabilities of HComP-Net, suggesting its potential utility in various domains.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks sufficient background information, which is necessary for readers unfamiliar with the problem context.  
- The framework's ability to handle "Convergent evolution" and similar cases is unclear; more discussion on this topic is needed.  
- The evaluation is limited to three datasets, raising concerns about scalability and generalizability to larger, more diverse datasets.  
- Comparisons with HPNet may not be fair due to differences in feature map resolutions, necessitating adjustments for a more equitable evaluation.  
- The effectiveness of the masking mechanism is not clearly illustrated in the figures, making it difficult to assess its impact.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the background section by including more related work to provide context for the proposed problem. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion on the framework's ability to address "Convergent evolution" and similar cases. To enhance the evaluation, we encourage the authors to test HComP-Net on larger datasets and to adjust HPNet to generate larger feature maps for a fairer comparison. Furthermore, we advise the authors to clarify the effectiveness of the masking mechanism in their visualizations and to address the minor language issues noted in the reviews.
