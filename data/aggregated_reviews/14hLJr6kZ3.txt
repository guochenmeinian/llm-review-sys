Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach called Prompt Gradient Alignment (PGA) for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). The authors formulate UDA as a multi-objective optimization problem, aligning gradients between source and target domains to mitigate conflicts. They introduce a regularization term that penalizes gradient norms to enhance generalization. The method is empirically validated across standard UDA benchmarks, demonstrating consistent improvements over existing prompt-based methods, and includes a theoretical generalization error bound.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized, with clear presentation and strong empirical results across multiple UDA benchmarks, showing substantial performance gains.
- The theoretical analysis, including a generalization bound, adds credibility to the proposed method.
- The method avoids complex Hessian calculations by using Taylor expansion approximations, which is a significant technical advancement.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed gradient manipulation lacks clear superiority over simpler methods like loss reweighting, especially in under-parameterized scenarios. The authors should provide theoretical or empirical validation for this.
- The backbone CLIP-ResNet-50 is considered weak; experiments with a CLIP-ViT model should be conducted.
- The paper does not adequately address the computational complexity and training time compared to baseline methods, which is crucial given the method's reliance on gradient manipulation.
- Some formulations are difficult to follow, and clarity could be improved by separating the loss function definitions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis to clarify why the proposed gradient manipulation is more effective than simpler methods like loss reweighting. Additionally, conducting experiments with a CLIP-ViT model would strengthen the findings. The authors should also provide a detailed comparison of computational complexity and training time against baseline methods. Furthermore, clarifying the loss function formulations and ensuring that all relevant related works are cited will enhance the paper's rigor and completeness.
