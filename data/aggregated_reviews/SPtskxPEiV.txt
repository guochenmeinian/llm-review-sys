### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the role of context in unsupervised methods for learning sentence representations, specifically through a dialog act classification task. The authors compare content-based and context-based sentence representations using a corpus of telephone conversations. Their findings indicate minimal benefits of context-based methods over content-based ones, while highlighting that increasing the dimensionality of sentence vectors enhances performance across all approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and provides a focused contribution that is original and well-discussed.  
- The experimental method is sound, and the study offers valuable insights into the influence of dimensionality on performance.  
- The results challenge common assumptions in the field, paving the way for further research.  

Weaknesses:  
- The empirical results are limited to a single task and corpus, which may restrict the generalizability of the findings.  
- There is a lack of qualitative analysis of predictions, and the paper does not explore the relationship between dimensionality and performance in depth.  
- The related works section is insufficient, missing references to state-of-the-art unsupervised sentence representation methods.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the scope of their empirical results by evaluating additional tasks, such as NLI, to enhance the paper's contributions. It would also be beneficial to include qualitative inspections of predicted dialog act assignments to identify patterns in what context-based methods capture compared to content-based methods. Additionally, we suggest revising the related works section to incorporate recent methods like SimCSE and DSE, and providing an analysis of the correlation matrix in Appendix A. Finally, clarifying the concept of 'teacher forcing' and correcting any typos would enhance the paper's clarity and presentation.
