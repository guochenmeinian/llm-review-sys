### Key Points
This paper presents the ACL OCL corpus, an open-source collection of 73K peer-reviewed publications from the ACL Anthology, which enhances existing resources by including metadata, PDF files, citation graphs, and structured full texts. The authors apply basic descriptive statistics to demonstrate the corpus's utility, identifying trends in research topics over time. Additionally, potential applications for future research are discussed.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The ACL OCL corpus is a significant advancement for the Computational Linguistics community, providing a valuable resource for topic classification and research trends.
- The structured data and metadata included enhance the corpus's usability for various research applications.
- The data extraction and curation methods are sound and thorough, with plans for ongoing maintenance and updates.

Weaknesses:
- The main contribution, the corpus itself, could have been presented in a shorter format, with other contributions appearing minor or ongoing.
- The corpus's reliance on the Parquet format may limit its accessibility to a broader corpus linguistics audience.
- The lack of comprehensive topic labels for all items raises concerns about the corpus's suitability for downstream applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the corpus's ongoing maintenance procedures to ensure its relevance over time. Additionally, consider expanding the list of contributions to include those mentioned during the rebuttal. Address the concerns regarding the choice of the Parquet format by providing alternative formats for broader accessibility. Clarify how tables are handled in the corpus and consider using terminology extraction tools for multi-word topics. Finally, ensure all inline citations are correctly formatted and address the grammatical issues noted in the reviews.
