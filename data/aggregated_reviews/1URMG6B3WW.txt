Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents two distinct contributions: the KrwEmd algorithm for hand abstraction in Texas Hold’em-style games and a detailed exploration of signal abstraction in ordered signal games. The authors propose that the KrwEmd algorithm integrates historical information through K-recall winrate features and earth mover’s distance, significantly outperforming existing methods like Ehs and PaEmd in exploitability while maintaining the same number of abstracted information sets. Additionally, the authors emphasize the importance of survival status and signal abstraction refinement in ordered signal games, asserting that the initial distribution over signals is crucial for understanding game dynamics. They clarify the interaction of the map \( \varsigma \) with the game tree and the structure of signals, and discuss the necessity of the parameter \( \gamma \) in distinguishing imperfect information games from sequential signaling games.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The integration of historical information via K-recall winrate features enhances the accuracy and reliability of hand abstraction.
2. KrwEmd shows significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods, indicating its practical value for real-world applications.
3. The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of signal abstraction and its mathematical underpinnings, effectively clarifying complex concepts.
4. The discussion on the relevance of survival status enhances the understanding of player payoffs in ordered signal games.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper's presentation is challenging, particularly for readers unfamiliar with poker AI, due to dense technical content and insufficient explanations of key concepts.
2. Scalability to more complex game scenarios is not adequately addressed, leaving questions about the algorithm's performance in diverse contexts.
3. Limited comparative analysis with existing methods makes it difficult to fully appreciate KrwEmd's unique advantages and limitations.
4. The definition of the game lacks clarity regarding the initial distribution of signals, and some explanations may confuse readers unfamiliar with poker rules.
5. The paper requires substantial rewriting to incorporate the reviewers' feedback, which may affect its clarity and coherence.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing a more accessible introduction to key concepts such as "imperfect recall abstraction" and "hand abstraction" for a broader audience. Including intuitive explanations, examples, or diagrams for the algorithms would enhance understanding. Additionally, a clearer contextualization of the contributions and practical implications of the results would be beneficial. 

We suggest including a dedicated limitations section that discusses potential computational challenges and the scope of the evaluation. Addressing questions regarding the scalability of KrwEmd to other game models and the sensitivity of the algorithm to hyperparameters would also strengthen the paper. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors clarify the role of the initial distribution in the game definition and incorporate detailed explanations from the rebuttal into the main text. Revising the definition of \( \Theta \) to include \( \gamma \) in a more integrated manner would avoid the need for an additional definition of the terminal signal set \( \tilde{\Theta} \). Lastly, simplifying the presentation of results and providing a glossary of technical terms would aid reader comprehension.
