Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents novel algorithms, FTPL-D and FTPL-D+, to address online learning with non-convex loss functions in dynamic environments. The authors extend the Follow the Perturbed Leader (FTPL) algorithm, providing theoretical regret analysis that demonstrates their methods' effectiveness. The results indicate that the non-convex dynamic regrets match those of convex cases, with guarantees of $O(V_T^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ dynamic regret and $O(\sqrt{\tau\log(T)})$ strongly-adaptive regret.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper fills a significant gap by extending the FTPL algorithm for non-convex and dynamic environments.
- It is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear descriptions of theoretical concepts and experimental setups.
- The algorithms achieve dynamic and adaptive regret simultaneously, which is a powerful contribution.

Weaknesses:
- The results are largely straightforward applications of existing analyses, lacking novelty in proof methods.
- The experimental setup is simplistic and does not explore more challenging tasks.
- The analysis of temporal variability does not adequately reflect the variability of the comparator sequence, focusing instead on loss sequence difficulty.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their contributions by clarifying which techniques are new compared to existing works. Additionally, the authors should consider including more complex experimental tasks to enhance the practical relevance of their findings. We also suggest addressing the limitations regarding the existence of an $(\alpha,\beta)$-approximate oracle and providing a more detailed discussion on the oracle's feasibility. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore the potential for high-probability results and to analyze the computational complexity of their algorithms more thoroughly.
