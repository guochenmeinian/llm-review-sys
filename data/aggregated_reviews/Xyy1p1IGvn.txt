### Key Points
This paper presents a unified solution for zero- and few-shot text classification by reformulating the assignment as a matching problem. The authors propose a matching model that leverages long, complex class descriptions, achieving strong performance across various datasets and few-shot settings. They extend the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) algorithm to enhance zero-shot learning performance. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of their approach, showing significant improvements over strong baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a timely and important problem with extensive experimentation across different datasets and few-shot regimes.  
- The proposed approach demonstrates strong zero-shot performance and scalability, surpassing baselines by 22.48% in the 10-shot setting.  
- The study is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear presentation of results.

Weaknesses:  
- The methods employed are well-known in the literature, with limited novelty beyond fine-tuning on few-shot datasets.  
- The paper could benefit from additional experiments exploring other zero-shot techniques and addressing the limitations of using long class descriptions, which are constrained by token limits.  
- The choice of macro average precision (AP) as a metric is unusual for zero-shot and few-shot tasks, and comparisons with recent zero-shot methods are lacking.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their contributions by incorporating comparisons with recent zero-shot methods from the literature, such as those by Schopf et al. (2022). Additionally, conducting further experiments with different zero-shot techniques, including inter-class correlations, would strengthen the validation of their approach. It would also be beneficial to explore the implications of the token length limitation on model performance and consider using averaged class accuracies to provide a clearer understanding of the model's effectiveness across seen and unseen classes. Finally, addressing the scalability of the matching model when dealing with hundreds of new classes would enhance the paper's robustness.
