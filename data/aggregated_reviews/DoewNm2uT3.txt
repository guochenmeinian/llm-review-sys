Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) method for solving robust routing problems under uncertain travel times using the min-max regret criterion. The authors propose a dual multi-head cross-attention mechanism to extract features from inputted uncertainty sets, demonstrating the efficacy of their approach through experiments on the robust Traveling Salesman Problem (RTSP) and Robust Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (RCVRP).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The authors have developed an innovative end-to-end neural model that effectively captures the features of robust routing problems.  
- Extensive experiments validate the approach's efficiency in handling robust routing across various scales with reduced computation time.  
- The paper is well-written, with a solid review of related works and a clear presentation of results.  

Weaknesses:  
- The algorithm lacks comparison with other existing neural combinatorial optimization methods.  
- Improvements made to the POMO network structure are unclear, raising questions about their impact on results.  
- The coding method for uncertain sets lacks innovation, and the paper does not provide access to the code or datasets for verification.  
- Minor writing issues, such as unclear definitions and small font sizes in tables, detract from clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison of their algorithm with existing neural combinatorial optimization works to better contextualize their contributions. Additionally, clarifying the improvements made to the POMO network structure and their effects on results would enhance the paper's rigor. We also suggest that the authors provide access to their code and datasets to facilitate verification of results. Lastly, addressing minor writing issues, such as clarifying definitions and adjusting font sizes in tables, would improve overall readability.
