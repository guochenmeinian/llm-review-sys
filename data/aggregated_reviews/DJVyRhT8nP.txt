### Key Points
This paper presents Human-Aware VLN, enhancing the real-world applicability of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) systems by incorporating dynamic human activities. The authors propose the HA3D simulator and the HA-R2R dataset, which integrate 3D human motion models and activity descriptions, bridging the gap between simulated environments and real-world scenarios. The methodology is detailed, particularly in the innovative use of egocentric action spaces and novel training strategies for the navigation agents, VLN-CM and VLN-DT.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper extends traditional VLN by incorporating dynamic human activities, addressing the gap between simulation and real-world scenarios, crucial for practical applications.
2. New evaluation metrics are introduced that consider human activities, providing a more accurate assessment of an agent's performance in real-world conditions.
3. Valuable insights and benchmarks for future research in embodied AI and Sim2Real transfer are provided.

Weaknesses:
1. The study is limited to indoor environments and does not consider more complex outdoor or mixed scenarios, nor does it cover dynamic situations involving multiple individuals simultaneously.
2. Some figures, such as Fig 3(c), Fig 4, and Fig 5, have fonts that are too small, making them difficult to read.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the HA3D and HA-R2R datasets by extending them to include outdoor scenarios, which would provide a more comprehensive training environment and enhance the agents' versatility. Additionally, we suggest increasing the font sizes in figures to improve clarity and readability, thereby enhancing the overall presentation and comprehension of the paper.
