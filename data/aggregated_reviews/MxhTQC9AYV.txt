### Key Points
This paper presents RealBehavior, a framework designed to understand the cognitive foundations of human-like behaviors in large language models (LLMs). The authors propose a psychometrically grounded approach, utilizing personality theories, particularly the Big Five personality traits, to evaluate LLM outputs. They introduce metrics for assessing the faithfulness of these evaluations, highlighting an imbalance across personality dimensions and analyzing the influence of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) on model behaviors.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and addresses a significant gap in understanding LLM behaviors through a psychometric lens.  
- The experimental design and organization are clear, with a strong connection established between personality assessments and human-like behaviors.  
- The analysis of findings is comprehensive, providing valuable insights into the evolution of LLMs and the implications of RLHF alignment.

Weaknesses:  
- The behavioral dataset is generated by LLMs, raising concerns about the reliability of evaluations conducted on other LLMs, as this creates a black box scenario.  
- The connection between personality dimensions and their relevance to downstream applications is inadequately explored, limiting practical insights for NLP practitioners.  
- The presentation may be challenging for those without a psychological background, necessitating clearer explanations of key concepts and terminologies.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset's reliability by incorporating human-generated scenarios to evaluate LLM behaviors more convincingly. Additionally, we suggest that the authors elaborate on the connection between personality dimensions and their applications, providing clearer guidance for practitioners on how to prioritize alignment objectives. Lastly, we encourage the authors to enhance the paper's accessibility by including more detailed explanations of psychological concepts and terminologies, particularly for non-expert readers.
