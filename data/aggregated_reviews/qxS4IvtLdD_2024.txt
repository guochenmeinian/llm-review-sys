### Key Points
This paper presents an inverse problem approach to reconstruct low-resolution blurred or obfuscated images using pre-trained generative models. The authors propose a plug-and-play framework with Conditional Conjugate Integrators, which simplifies sampling by projecting diffusion dynamics into a more manageable latent space. The method significantly reduces the number of sampling steps required for tasks like 4Ã— super-resolution on ImageNet, achieving high-quality results in as few as 5 steps. The paper provides rigorous mathematical formulations and demonstrates the method's effectiveness through experiments on various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of Conjugate Integrators for inverse problems is rigorously defined and proved.
- The proposed method drastically reduces the number of sampling steps compared to other approaches, achieving better reconstructed images than state-of-the-art methods.
- The paper is well-written, with a thorough literature review and robust theoretical foundations supporting the methodology.

Weaknesses:
- The paper is dense with equations and mathematical formulations, which may hinder understanding. Sections 2.3 and 3.4, along with numerical details, could be moved to the appendix to allow for more qualitative results and broader discussions.
- The reason for restricting the method to the $\Pi$GDM paradigm is unclear, and a more detailed computational comparison is needed as each iteration becomes more complex.
- The benefits of the proposed method in noisy and nonlinear inverse problem settings remain ambiguous, with limited quantitative results provided.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by moving dense mathematical sections to the appendix and including a figure to illustrate the method. Additionally, please clarify the rationale for the restriction to the $\Pi$GDM paradigm and provide a more detailed computational comparison of the iterations. It would also be beneficial to include quantitative results for noisy and nonlinear inverse problems, as well as explicitly stating all relevant settings in tables and figures. Finally, consider including an algorithmic box summarizing C-$\Pi$GFM and C-$\Pi$GDM for a concise overview of the method.
