Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel metric that integrates nearest-neighbor graphs and spectral methods to analyze high-dimensional point clouds through Vietoris-Rips filtrations and persistent homology. The authors demonstrate that their proposed distance effectively identifies significant topological features, validated through both synthetic examples and RNA-sequencing datasets. Additionally, the work addresses the challenges of persistent homology in noisy high-dimensional settings by introducing spectral and diffusion distances, supported by extensive numerical studies. Furthermore, the authors provide a code base for cycle matching in topological data analysis, specifically targeting the challenges posed by high-dimensional noise. They propose using cycle matching to identify topological features by matching cycles in persistence diagrams of original and resampled data. The results indicate that while cycle matching with Euclidean distances performs poorly, the use of diffusion distance shows improved performance, with higher maximal prevalences and consistent matching of the ground truth cycle across resamples.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses relevant problems in topological data analysis, particularly concerning high-dimensional data with low intrinsic dimensions.
- The experimental section is comprehensive, incorporating a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets, and is well-presented with minimal errors.
- The code base is user-friendly and facilitates proof-of-concept experiments.
- The exploration of diffusion distance demonstrates superior performance in identifying topological features compared to Euclidean distance.
- The paper acknowledges the limitations of cycle matching and provides a clear comparison with spectral methods.

Weaknesses:
- There is insufficient justification for the choice of the loop detection score as a comparative measure, and clarity is lacking regarding the specific score \( s_m \) used.
- The paper does not adequately discuss the limitations of the proposed methods, focusing primarily on their strengths without addressing potential shortcomings or comparisons to other recent approaches in the literature.
- Cycle matching is computationally expensive, with reported run times significantly slower than alternative methods.
- The approach struggles with the curse of dimensionality, leading to unreliable prevalence scores for true features.
- The findings indicate that the cycle matching method does not consistently identify the ground truth feature across varying noise levels.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of why the loop detection score is the appropriate metric for comparison, providing a clearer rationale for its use. Additionally, we suggest including a brief intuitive explanation of the proposed distance measure in Section 5 to enhance understanding. It would also be beneficial to explicitly discuss the limitations of the work in the main body of the paper, rather than relegating such discussions to the appendix. We further recommend that the authors improve the efficiency of the cycle matching algorithm to reduce run times, potentially by optimizing the implementation or exploring alternative computational strategies. Incorporating more extensive experiments with diffusion distance in the main text to highlight its advantages over Euclidean distance would also be beneficial. Finally, we encourage the authors to engage with recent literature more thoroughly, particularly regarding spectral methods in persistent homology, to strengthen the contextual relevance of their contributions and to address the limitations of cycle matching more thoroughly, especially regarding its performance in high-dimensional settings.
