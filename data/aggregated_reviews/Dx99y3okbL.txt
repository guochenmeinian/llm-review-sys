Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies the interaction between learnability and robust learnability in distribution learning, exploring how candidate distributions can be corrupted. The authors demonstrate an equivalence between learnability and a robust version where a contaminated distribution is added to the nominal distribution. They investigate the relationship between differential privacy (DP) and learnability, revealing that DP can imply learnability under certain contamination models but not others. Additionally, the paper examines sample compression schemes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper covers a wide range of settings related to distribution learnability, including additive and subtractive contamination, differential privacy, and sample compression.
- The technical quality is high, with sound proofs presented in the appendix.
- The paper is well-organized and generally easy to follow, with a thorough introduction.

Weaknesses:
- The writing lacks clarity, making it challenging for readers to grasp the technical results. The definitions are difficult to parse, particularly those in Definition 1.1, which could be condensed.
- There is insufficient motivation for the problem, limiting its appeal to a broader audience.
- The introduction is overly lengthy, delaying the presentation of the paper's contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing and presentation throughout the paper. Specifically, consider condensing the definitions in Definition 1.1 and providing examples or figures to illustrate them. Additionally, we suggest rewriting the introduction to better motivate the problem of distribution learning, summarize the main results without stating them, and clearly list the contributions by the end of the second page. Finally, clarify the terminology around "robust" versus "agnostic" learnability to avoid confusion.
