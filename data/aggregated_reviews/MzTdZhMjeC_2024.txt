Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel benchmark and approach for Multi-object Demand-driven Navigation (MO-DDN), where an agent must locate multiple objects based on complex user-specific demand instructions. The authors propose a coarse-to-fine exploration strategy that integrates an attribute model trained using CLIP features and a VQ-VAE loss. The method is evaluated on the HSSD dataset, demonstrating significant improvements over several baselines. Additionally, the paper discusses a method for segmenting blocks from a point cloud generated by a robot exploring an environment, where the robot does not initially know the number of blocks. The segmentation process is limited to already discovered points, and runtime examples are provided in Appendix A.3.1 to illustrate this. The authors express gratitude for the reviewers' feedback, which has enhanced the paper's readability and completeness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of MO-DDN addresses real-life complexities in demand-driven navigation, particularly in multi-object searches.
2. The coarse-to-fine exploration strategy effectively combines modular and end-to-end methods, optimizing performance.
3. The evaluation against multiple baselines shows significant improvements in success rates and navigation efficiency.
4. The attribute model's use of features trained with a discretized codebook and VQ-VAE loss is well-motivated.
5. The authors effectively addressed reviewers' concerns, leading to improved clarity and detail in the paper.
6. The inclusion of runtime examples in Appendix A.3.1 enhances understanding of the segmentation process.

Weaknesses:
1. The implementation complexity of the coarse-to-fine exploration strategy may hinder practical deployment.
2. Generalization to unseen environments is not extensively evaluated.
3. The assumption of fixed attribute numbers limits the model's flexibility.
4. The method's heavy reliance on pre-trained models like CLIP and GPT-4 may pose limitations in certain environments.
5. The paper provides limited discussion on potential limitations and challenges in various applications.
6. Some reviewers noted a lack of clarity in the writing of the method, which required further elaboration.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method section, particularly regarding the fine exploration policy and its training details. It would be beneficial to include a baseline evaluation of the pretrained CLIP features without attribute-based fine-tuning to establish effectiveness. Additionally, clarifying the distinction between basic and preferred solutions in the context of demand instructions would enhance understanding. We also suggest providing more examples of attribute features and addressing the scalability of the method with increasing complexity in demand instructions. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors incorporate detailed explanations in the main text rather than relegating important information to appendices, specifically clarifying the role of $r_b$ and $r_p$ in regulating preferences and highlighting the advantages of their flexibility for user adjustments. Lastly, the authors should provide more details on training end-to-end agents in fine exploration, including dataset features and training time, and include supplementary experiments in Table 1 to demonstrate the method's superiority.
