Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents $\epsilon$-softmax, a method designed to address label noise by modifying softmax outputs to approximate one-hot vectors with a controllable error $\epsilon$. The authors provide both theoretical and empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of this approach across various datasets and noise types. The method is characterized as simple, plug-and-play, and capable of being integrated with existing label-noise robust methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The writing is clear and the proposed method is theoretically sound, demonstrating robustness to label noise.
- Extensive experiments validate the method's effectiveness, showing superior performance compared to existing approaches.
- The method's plug-and-play nature enhances its practical applicability across different classifiers.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation behind the effectiveness of $\epsilon$-softmax requires further clarification.
- The performance improvements over competitor methods appear marginal and may not be statistically significant.
- There is a lack of detailed discussions on the theoretical advantages of $\epsilon$-softmax compared to other methods, such as temperature-dependent softmax and sparse regularization.
- The sensitivity of the method to hyperparameters, particularly $m$, $\alpha$, and $\beta$, needs more thorough investigation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the underlying reasons for the robustness of $\epsilon$-softmax, particularly how controlling the approximation error $\epsilon$ aids in handling label noise. Additionally, conducting statistical significance tests on the experimental results would strengthen the claims of performance improvement. It would be beneficial to include ablation studies on the hyperparameters and provide guidance on selecting $m$ for practical applications. Furthermore, a more detailed comparison with related methods, including temperature-dependent softmax and sparse regularization, should be included to highlight the advantages of $\epsilon$-softmax. Finally, addressing the axis labels in figures and ensuring rigorous definitions of mathematical notations will enhance the clarity and presentation of the paper.
