### Key Points
This paper presents a novel undetectable watermarking scheme for generative image models, effectively preventing detection by adversaries through adaptive queries. The authors utilize a pseudorandom error-correcting code to ensure both undetectability and robustness of the watermark. Experimental validation using Stable Diffusion confirms that the watermark maintains image quality and resists existing watermark removal techniques. The theoretical background is well-articulated, and the experiments strongly support the claims made.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- High overall quality of work with a well-stated theoretical background.  
- Clear and easy-to-follow writing.  
- Novel incorporation of PRC into watermarking, demonstrating significant performance gains in image quality, undetectability, and robustness.  
- Impressive undetectability as shown in Figure 1.  

Weaknesses:  
- Concerns regarding the specific Generate and Recover algorithms, particularly the potential impact of lower accuracy in the Recover algorithm.  
- Questions about the applicability of the method to different architectures.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the potential variability in the accuracy of the Recover algorithm and its implications on the overall effectiveness of the watermarking scheme. Additionally, we suggest exploring the applicability of the proposed method to different architectures to enhance its versatility.
