### Key Points
This paper investigates over-parametrized models in causal inference, focusing on high-dimensional linear regression and synthetic control estimators with numerous control units. The authors propose a tuning-free synthetic-control method and explore the prediction risk behaviors of these estimators, introducing a unified theoretical perspective on the "model-averaging property," as demonstrated in Propositions 1 and 4. They assert that complex models cannot perform worse than the average of simpler models, supported by high-level assumptions (MA and P). The findings provide insights into the "benign overfitting" phenomenon in causal inference and document the properties of the proposed method using a real-world dataset, suggesting practical relevance for applied researchers lacking strong priors on the significance of individual control units.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper offers a novel perspective on the double descent phenomenon in the interpolating regime, leveraging properties of predictive estimators.  
- The proposed tuning-free method is applicable in scenarios with many control units, enhancing its practical applicability.  
- The documentation of properties on a real-world dataset and the derivation of theoretical properties add depth to the analysis.  
- The effective combination of linear algebra and convex analysis elucidates the performance of complex models in high-dimensional causal estimators.  
- The discussion on the relationship to interpolating regression provides valuable context and enhances the clarity of the authors' focused approach.

Weaknesses:  
- The scope of applicability for the results may be limited, and a discussion on potential extensions and challenges would be beneficial.  
- Additional theoretical results are needed to clarify the lower-level conditions that ensure convex model-averaging leads to improved performance.  
- Additional comparisons to previous approaches would strengthen the paper's positioning, particularly regarding the limitations of existing results on double descent in synthetic control contexts.  
- The theoretical contributions could be complemented with more extensive numerical experiments to validate the assumptions and findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the expected scope of extensions, limitations, and potential challenges related to their findings. Additionally, providing comparisons to previous approaches would clarify the distinctive features of their techniques. We suggest incorporating a more extensive set of numerical experiments, such as an ablation study with synthetic datasets and experiments with real-world datasets, to empirically support their theoretical findings. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the novelty of Proposition 4 and its implications, as well as to address the bias analysis in the context of benign overfitting. Lastly, including additional theoretical results to elucidate the lower-level conditions necessary for convex model-averaging to enhance performance would strengthen the manuscript. A more thorough literature review on model averaging and its implications in causal inference would also enhance the paper's depth.
