Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of multi-unit auctions where a seller allocates $K$ identical items to bidders with quasi-linear valuations and decreasing marginal returns. Bidders submit bid vectors, and the seller uses uniform pricing based on the $K$-th or $(K+1)$-st highest bid. The authors efficiently compute an optimal bid vector in the offline setting, design low-regret algorithms for the online setting, and analyze equilibria to assess bidder collusion susceptibility. The work contributes to the literature on dynamic bidding strategies and has implications for real-world applications like CO2 emissions licensing.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper contributes significantly to the literature by focusing on dynamic bidding strategies rather than solely on the seller's perspective.
- The novel insight regarding the computation of optimum bidding strategies through maximum weight paths in a DAG is intriguing.
- The results and proofs are well articulated, and the model is well-motivated.

Weaknesses:
- The organization of the paper is problematic, particularly with the equilibrium analysis being buried in the introduction rather than presented in a dedicated section.
- The connection between the equilibrium analysis and the $T$-round setting is unclear, and the convergence of algorithms is not adequately addressed.
- The conclusion regarding the preference for the $K$-th price auction over the $(K+1)$-st price auction lacks clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization of the paper by creating a separate section for the equilibrium analysis to enhance clarity. Additionally, the authors should address the convergence of algorithms in the context of no-regret learning and clarify the rationale behind comparing the $K$-th and $(K+1)$-st price auctions. It would be beneficial to explore non-pure Nash equilibria for the $K$-th price auction to provide a more comprehensive analysis. Lastly, we suggest that the authors ensure consistency between the abstract and the content of the paper.
