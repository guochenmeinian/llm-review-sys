Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a deep-learning-based method for visualizing shared features in category-selective neurons, particularly in the macaque IT cortex, which respond to out-of-category stimuli. The authors propose using parallel backpropagation to identify visual features that drive neuron selectivity by modeling responses based on latent activations of a deep neural network. The method aims to enhance understanding of why certain non-category objects activate specific neurons, providing insights into neural coding and visual processing.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The method is original, innovative, and clearly presented, contributing valuable insights into IT neurophysiology.  
- The structure of the paper is well-organized, with a clear methodology and detailed explanations of the approach, including an original experimental component.  
- The work shows promise in advancing understanding of visual information processing in the brain.

Weaknesses:  
- The presentation of scientific results is somewhat anecdotal and lacks systematic analysis, limiting the significance of findings.  
- The method's dependency on the deep neural network's effectiveness raises concerns about generalizability to other categories and contexts.  
- The primary contribution relies on existing techniques rather than introducing new algorithms, which may disappoint readers seeking significant advancements in machine learning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the systematic presentation of scientific results to enhance the significance of their findings. Additionally, the authors should explore the applicability of their method to neurons in V4 and V1, as well as its potential for analyzing artificial deep networks. Clarifying the method's novel contributions compared to existing visualization techniques and addressing how it can be adapted for other semantic categories or brain regions would strengthen the paper. Finally, we suggest including a more comprehensive mathematical analysis of shared features beyond basic categorizations to deepen the insights provided.
