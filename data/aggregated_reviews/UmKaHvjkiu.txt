### Key Points
This paper presents a multi-step prompting method for closed-book long-form question answering (QA), which involves extracting presupposition statements from questions, generating feedback based on these presuppositions, and ultimately producing answers. Experiments conducted on three datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms a baseline few-shot approach, particularly in handling ambiguous questions and those with false presuppositions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is novel and effectively addresses both ambiguous and misleading questions.
- The approach of extracting presuppositions and generating answers based on them is technically sound.
- The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of experimental details.

Weaknesses:
- There is a lack of baseline comparisons beyond few-shot methods; specifically, the authors should consider comparing against the query refinement method and a step-by-step baseline.
- No ablation study is provided to analyze the necessity of the intermediate steps in the prompting process.
- Evaluation of the intermediate outputs (presuppositions, feedback, and actions) is missing, raising concerns about their accuracy and impact on final answer quality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including a comprehensive baseline comparison, particularly against the query refinement method and the step-by-step baseline. Additionally, conducting an ablation study to assess the necessity of each prompting step would enhance the understanding of the method's effectiveness. Furthermore, we suggest providing an evaluation of the generated presuppositions, feedback, and actions to clarify their accuracy and relevance to the final answer generation.
