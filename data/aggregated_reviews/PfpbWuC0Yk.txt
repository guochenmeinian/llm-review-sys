### Key Points
This paper presents an entropy-targeted active learning (ET-AL) framework aimed at mitigating data bias in material science by guiding the acquisition of new data to enhance the diversity of underrepresented crystal systems. The authors propose using Gaussian Processes (GP) for label fitting and emphasize the importance of their approach in addressing the significant issue of data bias.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written with clear motivation.
2. The ET-AL framework is computationally efficient and easy to understand.
3. The sample acquisition method using Gaussian Processes is effective and adaptable to other domains.

Weaknesses:
1. The superiority of the framework compared to adaptive data augmentation approaches (e.g., AutoAugment, CutMix) is not demonstrated.
2. The rationale for using Gaussian Processes to model output distribution is unclear; alternative methods like variational inference should be considered.
3. The comparison of the method is limited to Gradient Boosting (GB) and Random Forest (RF), raising concerns about generalization; performance against neural network-based approaches should be explored.
4. The criteria for selecting experts in the active learning process are not discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by demonstrating the superiority of the ET-AL framework over adaptive data augmentation methods. Additionally, the authors should clarify the motivation for using Gaussian Processes and consider discussing alternative modeling approaches such as variational inference. Expanding the comparison to include neural network-based methods would strengthen the evaluation of the framework's performance. Finally, we suggest that the authors elaborate on their criteria for selecting experts in the active learning process.
