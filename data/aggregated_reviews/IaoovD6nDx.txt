Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method called State-Wise Action Refined to investigate the causal relationship between actions and task rewards in reinforcement learning (RL). The authors address action space redundancy by introducing a causality-driven action space refinery and propose two algorithms, TD-SWAR and Dyn-SWAR, which identify task-related actions during temporal difference learning and through dynamic model prediction, respectively. The empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of these causality-aware RL agents across various continuous control tasks with redundant action spaces, supported by extensive experimental results and ablation studies. The authors emphasize the limitations of traditional causal discovery methods and highlight the need for a reparameterization trick to perform interventions effectively in complex environments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The authors propose a significant and interesting method for exploring causality in RL, which can enhance learning efficiency in tasks with redundant actions.  
- The overall presentation is clear, and the pipeline figure aids in understanding the methodology.  
- The integration of causality into action reduction is a meaningful contribution to improving sample efficiency in RL.  
- The authors effectively address prior reviewer concerns and provide a comprehensive summary of their technical contributions, including methodological improvements and empirical validation.  
- The introduction of the selector network as a unique intervention mechanism is innovative and addresses significant challenges in conventional methods.  

Weaknesses:  
- The technical description of the proposed approach is complicated, leading to a lack of clarity regarding its main technical contribution.  
- The paper contains grammar mistakes and lacks sentence flow, making it difficult to grasp the central contribution.  
- The proposed algorithms, TD-SWAR and Dyn-SWAR, lack sufficient experimental analysis support, and the experimental settings are limited in complexity.  
- Some reviewers express confusion regarding the necessity of causal terminology and its relation to existing causal inference theories, suggesting that the method may not need to be framed within a causal context.  
- There are inconsistencies in the terminology used regarding causal language, which may lead to confusion.  
- Some reviewers noted that the claims about the necessity of resettable environments for interventions and the inefficiency of applying interventions to each action dimension are misleading.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the technical description to better convey the main contributions of the paper. Addressing grammar issues and enhancing sentence flow will also aid comprehension. Additionally, we suggest providing more comprehensive experimental analysis, including comparisons with state-of-the-art RL algorithms and visualizations of learned causal structures. Clarifying the connection between the proposed methods and real-world applications, along with discussing the theoretical guarantees of the causal claims, would strengthen the paper significantly. We also recommend improving the clarity of the explanation regarding the monotonicity of selecting a larger N, possibly by providing empirical studies to support their claims. Consider reframing the presentation of the method to avoid potential confusion around causal terminology, as suggested by reviewers. It may be beneficial to clarify the relationship of the method to existing causal inference theories or to present it simply as an action selection method without causal implications. Lastly, we encourage the authors to ensure that all diagrams accurately represent the causal relationships discussed in the paper and to include experiments that demonstrate the degradation of performance without the action selection algorithm, as this would clearly illustrate the impact of their proposed method.
