### Key Points
This paper addresses the human-centered community detection problem within hybrid metaverse networks that incorporate AI entities. The authors propose CUSA, an innovative framework that employs AI-aware clustering techniques to enhance community integrity while prioritizing human connectivity. The study presents four strategies to synthesize these networks for empirical evaluation, demonstrating that CUSA outperforms traditional methods in forming human-centric communities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a novel scenario by studying community detection in metaverse settings that include AI entities.
2. It presents a compelling approach by considering AI entity nodes as reference points for community clustering.
3. The proposed CUSA framework shows significant technical innovation, incorporating a sophisticated AI node scoring mechanism and human-centric modifications to clustering algorithms.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a thorough discussion on related work in community detection involving AI-driven nodes, often referred to as Social bot studies.
2. The application scenarios for CUSA remain unclear, particularly regarding the role of AI nodes as prior knowledge.
3. Methodological gaps exist, including the absence of theoretical analysis for algorithm complexity and limited justification for key parameter choices.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on related work in community detection involving AI nodes to provide context for their contributions. Additionally, clarify the application scenarios for CUSA, specifically addressing whether users are aware they are interacting with AI nodes. We suggest providing a more detailed implementation of comparative methods to ensure fair evaluation and specifying the time and space complexity of the proposed method. Furthermore, the authors should elaborate on the rationale behind the chosen weights for edges and explore the impact of different AI-to-human ratios in their experimental evaluation. Lastly, we encourage the authors to validate their approach on real-world datasets containing human-AI interactions to enhance the credibility of their findings.
