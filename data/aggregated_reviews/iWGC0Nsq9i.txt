Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical investigation into the estimation of the unknown normalizing constant \( Z_1 \) of a given density \( p_1 = f_1 / Z_1 \) using bridge distributions. The authors propose a two-step estimator and demonstrate that the Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) loss is optimal for any number \( K \) of bridging distributions, challenging the optimality of importance sampling (IS). They show that with an infinite number of bridge distributions, the error can be polynomial rather than exponential, particularly for geometric paths. The paper also discusses the arithmetic path, which can yield an error independent of dimension when the normalizing constant is known. Furthermore, the authors analyze the optimality of the NCE estimator for a sequence of distributions and clarify that both the NCE and the reference estimator have the same mean squared error (MSE). They acknowledge the dependency of the arithmetic path's optimality on having an oracle for calculating \( Z \), complicating the sampling process.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The theoretical contributions are original and significant, providing insights into the optimality of NCE and the effects of annealed distributions.
- The empirical validation of results on toy examples supports the theoretical claims.
- The presentation is clear, with well-structured results and effective use of illustrations.
- The authors provide a clear response to reviewer comments, indicating a willingness to enhance the clarity of their arguments and propose specific modifications to improve the paper.

Weaknesses:
- Some related work is missing, particularly the overlap with previous findings in reference [1], which already establishes that NCE is a maximum likelihood estimator.
- The practical applicability of the results is questionable, as the assumption of perfect sampling is strong and may not hold in realistic scenarios.
- The proposed two-step estimator lacks numerical testing in realistic scenarios where MCMC sampling is necessary.
- The dependency on an oracle for \( Z \) in the arithmetic path may limit practical applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related work, particularly reference [1], to adequately credit prior findings on NCE and its maximum likelihood properties. Additionally, we suggest that the authors address the limitations of the perfect sampling assumption, especially regarding the arithmetic path's requirements for a stronger sample oracle. It would be beneficial to include more extensive empirical results on complex problems to demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed methods. We also recommend that the authors improve the robustness of their findings by conducting thorough tests of the two-step procedure using MCMC sampling to assess its performance against traditional methods. Finally, we encourage the authors to further clarify the implications of the oracle dependency in their discussion to enhance understanding of its computational challenges.
