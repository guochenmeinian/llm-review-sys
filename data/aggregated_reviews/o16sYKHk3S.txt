Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on causal discovery with unobserved causal variables, focusing on the identifiability of causal structures among latent variables through soft interventions. The authors propose a VAE-based generative model that recovers causal mechanisms from observational and interventional data, demonstrating promising results on a gene mutation dataset. The work builds on prior research, showing that under specific assumptions, the latent causal model can be recovered by identifying interventions targeting source nodes and removing them. Additionally, the authors introduce a novel approach to handling multi-node interventions, as detailed in Theorem 3 of Section 4.4, which allows for the prediction of multi-node interventional effects from single-node components. The paper provides identifiability proofs for latent causal models under general soft interventions, contrasting with prior studies that focus on hard interventions or specific model types.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors clearly outline the steps for identifying ancestral relationships and direct edges in a causal DAG, providing concrete examples for better understanding.
- Experimental results indicate the model's capability to learn causal mechanisms and generalize to unseen interventional data.
- The paper is well-organized and presents a clear theoretical framework supported by detailed proofs.
- The authors successfully demonstrate the ability to extrapolate multi-node interventional effects, which is crucial for real-world applications.
- The identifiability proofs presented are innovative, addressing a more complex scenario than previous works.
- The paper enhances theoretical robustness through comprehensive discussions on faithfulness assumptions.

Weaknesses:
- The discussion on interventional faithfulness is insufficient; it should clarify whether it implies that all causal variables are observed.
- Initial responses may have caused confusion regarding the handling of multi-node interventions, which required clarification.
- The validity of assumptions, particularly assumptions 2 and 3, needs further exploration in real-world contexts.
- The theoretical contribution is limited, primarily extending prior work without significant simplification of complex assumptions.
- The architecture's complexity and the lack of ablation studies make it unclear how each component contributes to the model's performance.
- The paper could benefit from further elaboration on the implications of the results in practical scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on interventional faithfulness to clarify its implications. Additionally, we encourage the authors to explore the validity of assumptions 2 and 3 in practical scenarios. It would strengthen the paper to include ablation studies to elucidate the contributions of individual components within the model architecture. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors provide comparisons with baseline models, such as a simple VAE, to contextualize their empirical results better. Lastly, we recommend improving clarity regarding the handling of multi-node interventions to prevent confusion and providing more detailed discussions on the practical implications of their findings, particularly in real-world applications involving combinatorial perturbations.
