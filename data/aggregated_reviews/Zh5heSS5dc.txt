### Key Points
This paper presents a course designed to teach students about AI in structural biology, targeting individuals with both computational and biological backgrounds. The authors emphasize hands-on experience with modern AI models and aim to equip students with tools for understanding future developments in AI research. The course structure is well-organized, with a focus on bridging the gap between computational and biological disciplines, and includes practical activities to enhance students' capabilities in implementing these systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The course offers a valuable experience for students, effectively presenting its structure and content.  
- There is a strong emphasis on interaction with data, fostering an understanding of protein and molecular structures.  
- The website is user-friendly and well-organized, enhancing accessibility.  

Weaknesses:  
- The course outline, while reasonable, may appear forced at times, and the provided website lacks sufficient materials.  
- There is concern regarding the scope of the course, particularly the limited time allocated to ML fundamentals, which could disadvantage students with primarily biological backgrounds.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the course by defining a clearer scope and potentially requiring a basic mathematical background as a prerequisite, such as a course in probability, statistics, or linear algebra. Alternatively, consider reducing the technical content in later units to focus more on the general applicability of the methods.
