Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper explores code switching (CS) in speech translation, focusing on two main challenges: translating CS speech into a third language and handling streaming settings. The authors provide baseline results for both offline and streaming models, extending existing datasets with annotations for a third language. The paper is well-written and contributes valuable baselines for CS research through extensive experimentation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and detailed enough for reproducibility.
- The experiments on streaming speech translation are engaging, particularly the metrics tradeoff and k-analysis sections, which serve as a good introduction for readers.
- Results on the proximity of CS words effectively highlight issues relevant to both streaming and offline settings.

Weaknesses:
- The authors mention using LSTMs in the decoder but lack details on their preliminary findings regarding this choice. They should investigate if similar observations exist in related works.
- The performance degradation associated with prefix-sampling is not discussed, raising questions about its inclusion in the paper.
- Limited information on the quality of the new target datasets is provided, lacking metrics like inter-annotator agreement.
- The paper does not explain why models performed better on Spanish datasets compared to German, nor does it include examples of good and suboptimal translations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the LSTM decoder by providing more details on its advantages based on preliminary investigations. Additionally, we suggest including an analysis of the performance differences between Spanish and German datasets to enhance understanding. It would also be beneficial to provide specific examples of translations, illustrating both successful and unsuccessful outputs, along with explanations of the factors influencing their quality. Lastly, we urge the authors to address quality control measures for the translated datasets and consider conducting ablation experiments to assess the impact of different tasks on performance.
