Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents PromptIR, a prompt-based learning approach for all-in-one image restoration that encodes degradation-specific information to dynamically guide the restoration network. The authors demonstrate its effectiveness through experimental evaluations on image denoising, deraining, and dehazing, achieving state-of-the-art results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method offers a generic and efficient plugin module with lightweight prompts applicable to various degradation types without prior corruption information.
2. It achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple image restoration tasks.
3. The paper is well-organized and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks discussions on limitations, such as sensitivity to the number of prompts and performance on combined degradation types.
2. There is insufficient visualization of the learned prompts and an explanation of their functionality.
3. Comparisons regarding model complexity, including runtime and parameter count, are missing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the limitations of the proposed method, particularly regarding the sensitivity of results to the number of prompts and the performance on multiple degradation types. Additionally, we suggest including visualizations of the learned prompts and clarifying their roles. Furthermore, comparisons on model complexity, including runtime and parameter numbers, should be incorporated to provide a clearer understanding of the method's efficiency.
