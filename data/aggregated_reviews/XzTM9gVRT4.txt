### Key Points
This paper presents a study of mean estimation and density estimation under functional local differential privacy (FLDP), deriving minimax rates and optimal estimation procedures. The authors propose algorithms that achieve these rates and provide empirical evidence of improved privacy-utility tradeoffs compared to existing methods enforcing local differential privacy (LDP). The results include analogues to Le Cam's and Assouad's bounds, and the authors emphasize the significance of the tradeoff function in determining minimax risk.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The work is timely and relevant, addressing minimax estimation rates for FLDP, a recently introduced concept that has garnered attention.  
- The mathematical results are thorough, with clear derivations and practical algorithms that match the theoretical rates.  
- The paper is well-written, providing helpful background and interpretations that enhance accessibility for non-experts.  

Weaknesses:  
- Key concepts such as epsilon-LDP and local FDP are not formally defined, which may hinder reader comprehension.  
- The dependence of results on the privacy level $\mu$ is not explicitly stated in the rates, leading to an incomplete comparison with epsilon-LDP.  
- Some theoretical results lack sufficient interpretation, particularly regarding the general bounds and the role of the parameter $\kappa$ in the lower bounds.  
- The experimental section is sparse, and the paper primarily focuses on theoretical aspects without adequately addressing practical implications or comparisons with other recent algorithms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of key concepts by formally defining epsilon-LDP and local FDP within the paper. Additionally, the authors should explicitly include the privacy level $\mu$ in the rates to enhance the comparison with epsilon-LDP. Further interpretation of the general versions of Le Cam's and Assouad's bounds would be beneficial, particularly regarding when the lower bound is expected to be non-negative. We also suggest providing more context for the parameter $\kappa$ and its relationship with the tradeoff function $f$. Lastly, expanding the experimental section to include comparisons with other recent local DP algorithms would strengthen the paper's practical relevance.
