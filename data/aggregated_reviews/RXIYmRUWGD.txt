Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new unsupervised Chinese word segmentation (UCWS) model that integrates segmentation signals from an unsupervised segmental language model with a pre-trained BERT classifier using pseudo-labels. The authors propose that this method reduces training time while achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple UCWS tasks. The experimental results are comprehensive, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with clear motivation and methodology.
- The proposed method achieves SOTA performance on eight UCWS tasks while reducing training time.
- The experimental results are solid and provide reasonable analysis.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the proposed method is limited compared to Li et al. (2023), as it primarily involves fine-tuning BERT on pseudo-labels from a previous UCWS model.
- The rationale behind the effectiveness of the heuristic is unclear, particularly regarding the role of early stopping.
- The experimental setup raises concerns about the use of test set data during training, which could bias results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the novelty of their approach in relation to existing work, particularly Li et al. (2023). Additionally, we suggest conducting further analysis on the performance variations without early stopping to clarify its impact. It would also be beneficial to include a systematic analysis of segmentation failures and to explore the method's applicability to colloquial texts. Finally, we advise the authors to clearly label which methods utilize raw test data in Table 1 to enhance understanding of the experimental design.
