### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to multimodal hallucination detection by framing it as a sequence labeling task, which allows for the localization of hallucinated spans in responses. The authors propose a scalable pre-training method that generates synthetic data by replacing grounded phrases with hallucinated tokens, addressing data scarcity in hallucination detection. The experimental design is well-organized, demonstrating the model's performance across various conditions and providing insights into sample efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The innovative framing of hallucination detection as a sequence labeling task effectively addresses localization.
- The scalable pre-training approach using corrupted grounding data enhances sample efficiency and mitigates the need for costly human annotations.
- The experiments are methodically structured, offering a comprehensive assessment of the model's robustness.

Weaknesses:
- Noise in the pre-training data could be better managed; simple noise reduction methods like filtering through visual entailment models could improve results.
- The analysis of hallucinated phrases in the pre-training data lacks depth, particularly concerning relationships, attributes, or actions.
- Limited evaluation on M-Hal Detect does not encompass the diversity of real-world hallucinations.
- The reliance on synthetic data introduces potential inaccuracies, which may affect generalizability.
- The paper lacks a comparison with other baseline models for hallucination detection, which could validate the proposed method's effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the management of noise in the pre-training data by employing noise reduction techniques, such as filtering through visual entailment models. Additionally, we suggest conducting a detailed analysis of the nature of hallucinated phrases generated during pre-training to ensure that various types of hallucinations are adequately represented. Including human evaluation of the synthetically generated corrupted grounding data would enhance the reliability of the findings. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to compare their approach with other state-of-the-art LVLMs to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of their method's performance. Lastly, a more in-depth discussion on the trade-offs between pre-training with corrupted data and traditional methods would strengthen the paper.
