### Key Points
This paper presents CROWN, a framework aimed at addressing three significant challenges in personalized news recommendations: understanding diverse intents of news articles, differentiating user preferences post-read, and mitigating the cold-start problem for new users. The authors propose a combination of category-guided intent disentanglement, consistency-based news representation, and GNN-enhanced hybrid user representation. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that CROWN outperforms twelve state-of-the-art models across various metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with effective illustrations and a structured methodology.
- It introduces innovative concepts such as consistency-based representation and category prediction as an auxiliary task, enhancing intent disentanglement.
- The extensive experiments validate the framework's effectiveness and robustness across datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The paper employs complex terminology and dense sections, which may hinder reader comprehension.
- There is insufficient exploration of how intent disentanglement directly impacts user experience and recommendation quality.
- The GNN application lacks novelty, and the exploration of the cold-start problem is not sufficiently detailed.
- The evaluation does not adequately address potential limitations of the proposed model or the implications of title deception in recommendations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by providing clear definitions of "intent disentanglement" and "disentangled embeddings" in the Introduction. Additionally, the authors should include examples illustrating how considering the intent of news articles can enhance recommendations. It would be beneficial to discuss the specific limitations of the model and scenarios where it may underperform compared to other methods. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors clarify the necessity of incorporating subcategory information in the category prediction task and explore whether a dynamic approach to determining the number of intents for each article might be more effective. Lastly, we encourage the authors to consider the impact of title deception on recommendation performance and to provide a high-level description of the system design to enhance understanding.
