Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of the Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) technique to Riemannian manifolds, proposing a new optimization framework called Riemannian SAM. The authors provide a convergence analysis and empirical results demonstrating the method's efficiency. The paper aims to leverage the unique geometric properties of Riemannian spaces to enhance optimization performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors propose a general framework derived from first principles, making the paper accessible and providing sufficient background.
- Algorithm 1 is well-structured and aligns with the SAM framework.
- The convergence analysis reassures readers that Riemannian SAM performs comparably to Euclidean SAM.
- The extension of SAM to Riemannian manifolds is both natural and meaningful, with theoretical guarantees for convergence.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for why Riemannian optimization requires SAM is insufficiently addressed, particularly for problems solvable in both spaces.
- Limited new insights or proof techniques are presented, as the adaptation to the Riemannian regime closely follows existing Euclidean methods.
- The presentation is at times high-level and unclear, lacking detailed explanations and figures that could enhance understanding.
- The experimental section assumes familiarity with associated techniques, making the paper less self-contained.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for Riemannian optimization's need for SAM, providing theoretical explanations for the advantages of the proposed method. Additionally, we suggest including more detailed explanations of Algorithm 1 and its components, as well as incorporating figures to clarify complex concepts. The authors should also consider reporting average performance metrics and cross-validation results to strengthen the empirical analysis. Finally, addressing the clarity of the presentation and ensuring that the paper is self-contained will enhance its accessibility to a broader audience.
