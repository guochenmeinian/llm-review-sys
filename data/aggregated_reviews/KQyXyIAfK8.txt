Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework called SOC that effectively utilizes video-level visual-linguistic alignment to enhance referring video object segmentation (RVOS). The authors propose a semantic-assisted object cluster approach that integrates video content and textual guidance for unified temporal modeling and cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SOC outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements in performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The SOC framework shows superior performance on various benchmarks, clearly outperforming existing methods.
2. The paper provides a well-structured description of the SOC framework and its experimental results, making it easy to follow.
3. The introduction of visual-linguistic contrastive learning offers valuable semantic supervision for the task.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the approach appears limited, as the multi-modal fusion model primarily employs common multi-head cross-attention mechanisms.
2. The complexity of the method makes it difficult to discern the main contributions, particularly regarding the modules presented in Figure 1.
3. There is a lack of ablation studies on hyper-parameters, and the effectiveness of the Semantic Integration Module (SIM) is not experimentally validated.
4. The reliance on the quality of text descriptions for the visual-linguistic contrastive learning module may limit its effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity in the presentation of the SOC framework, particularly in Figure 1, to better highlight the essential components. Additionally, we suggest conducting ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the SIM and exploring alternative clustering methods for object grouping. The authors should also consider including detailed discussions on the impact of hyper-parameters and the potential integration of the video-level object clustering module within the temporal encoding process to enhance inference speed. Finally, addressing the limitations related to the quality of text descriptions and the complexity of the model would strengthen the overall contribution of the paper.
