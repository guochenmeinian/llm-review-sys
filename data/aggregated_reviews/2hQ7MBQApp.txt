Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of the minimizers of the loss surface in deep matrix factorization, focusing on those with minimal trace of the Hessian, a measure of flatness favored by SGD. The authors demonstrate that for matrix sensing under the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), the parameters exhibiting the least flatness correspond to matrices that approximately minimize the nuclear norm, leading to faster generalization guarantees compared to minimizing the Frobenius norm. Additionally, the paper provides a closed-form expression for the minimal Hessian trace with a single linear measurement.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The description of flatness bias is novel, and some results are unexpected.
- The writing is clear, thorough, and the proofs are easy to follow.
- The paper establishes a significant connection between flatness (minimal Hessian trace) and generalization in deep matrix factorizations.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on the trace of the Hessian as the appropriate measure of flatness for SGD is not universally accepted, as GD may use the largest eigenvalue instead, suggesting a different implicit bias.
- The lack of empirical experiments to validate the described bias for SGD and related methods limits the motivation for the theoretical assumptions.
- The restrictive assumptions, such as the RIP condition and the focus on interpolators with exactly minimal Hessian trace, may limit the applicability of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of assumptions, particularly regarding the RIP condition, by explicitly stating it before relevant theorems. Additionally, consider extending the generalization results to interpolators with approximately minimal Hessian trace, and explore the inductive bias of minimizing the Hessian trace for non-interpolating linear mappings. Incorporating empirical experiments to validate the theoretical findings would strengthen the paper's contributions and address concerns about practical significance. Lastly, we suggest clarifying the terminology used, such as "end-to-end parameters," to ensure it aligns with standard usage in the literature.
