Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to Transformer architecture by introducing the Blockwise Parallel Transformer (BPT), which merges blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward networks to address memory inefficiencies. The authors demonstrate that BPT significantly reduces memory requirements, allowing for training on sequences 8 to 64 times longer than vanilla Transformers and 2 to 4 times longer than previous memory-efficient models like FlashAttention. Empirical experiments validate the method's effectiveness in both language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The BPT method is well-motivated and straightforward, addressing a critical issue in Transformer architectures.
- The paper is well-structured and presents a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance across various tasks.
- The approach enables significant memory savings while maintaining or improving performance, which is crucial for training long-context models.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution over FlashAttention is limited, and the novelty of the proposed method is not highly significant.
- The paper lacks a comprehensive analysis of performance metrics such as perplexity, making it difficult to assess the BPT's effectiveness compared to other models.
- Some parts of the implementation remain unclear, particularly regarding the necessity of retaining output vectors for backpropagation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the implementation details, particularly regarding hardware and software requirements for BPT. Additionally, we suggest conducting a more thorough evaluation of the model's performance on language modeling tasks to provide a clearer comparison with existing methods. Addressing the questions raised about the memory costs associated with FFN layers and the necessity of stop_gradient in the implementation would also enhance the paper's rigor.
