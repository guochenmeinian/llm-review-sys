Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the use of emergent languages (EL) combined with count-based approaches to enhance exploration in sparse reward reinforcement learning (RL) settings. The authors propose a method leveraging emergent communication protocols as an auxiliary reward in navigation tasks, demonstrating that certain emergent communication games can effectively address exploration challenges. The Compactness Ambiguity Metric (CAM) is introduced to evaluate the performance of emergent languages compared to natural languages, with experimental results indicating potential improvements in exploration capabilities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The novelty of the approach is a significant strength, as emergent languages in RL are underexplored.
- The definition of the Compactness Ambiguity Metric (CAM) is valuable for comparing emergent and natural languages.
- The experimental results in simple Minigrid environments suggest the method's potential to enhance exploration.

Weaknesses:
- Presentation issues hinder readability, such as the use of bright colors on a white background and poorly labeled figures.
- Clarity is lacking in several explanations, particularly regarding the interpretation of figures and the properties of the emergent language.
- The evaluation is limited in terms of environments and baselines tested, with insufficient detail on differences from related works.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation by addressing aesthetic issues and ensuring figures are clearly labeled and easy to interpret. Additionally, we suggest enhancing clarity by simplifying explanations and providing more insights into the learned representations, such as sentence length and the number of unique utterances. Expanding the evaluation to include more environments and baselines would strengthen the paper, and a clearer comparison with existing methods should be included. Lastly, we advise that the authors consider restructuring the introduction of key concepts like EReLELA and CAM for better accessibility to a broader audience.
