Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Newton-Cotes Graph Neural Networks (NC), a time-continuous extension of Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs). The authors analyze the predictive variance of NC under Gaussian assumptions and demonstrate through numerical experiments that NC-formulated EGNNs outperform baseline EGNNs. The paper also introduces a new objective and regularization loss for higher-order features, providing theoretical guarantees for variance reduction with increased NC formula degree.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is clear and generalizable to other GNN classes beyond Equivariant GNNs.
- The paper is well-written, with effective visualizations and supplementary material enhancing understanding.
- The proposed architecture effectively tackles complex problems in particle systems, showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed method is a special case of a larger GNN class, yet lacks comparison with this class and with competitive baseline methods like Graph Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (GDEs).
- The components of NC(k)+ that enhance performance remain unclear without additional ablation studies.
- The analysis of prediction errors for intermediate velocities could be more in-depth, particularly regarding fluctuations during training.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the manuscript by including a comparison of the proposed NC method with GDE models to clarify its advantages. Additionally, conducting ablation studies to identify which components of NC(k)+ contribute to performance improvements would strengthen the analysis. We also suggest providing clearer insights into the training dynamics, particularly regarding the fluctuations in prediction errors and the derivation of coefficients for the Newton-Cotes formula. Lastly, addressing the limitations of the method in the context of existing literature on multi-step predictions would enhance the paper's contribution.
