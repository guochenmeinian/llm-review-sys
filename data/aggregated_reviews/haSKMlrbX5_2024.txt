Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on aligning samples from large language models (LLMs) with human preferences using best-of-$n$ (BoN) sampling methods. The authors propose BoNBoN alignment to mimic the sample distribution of BoN without generating $n$ samples, achieving a high win-rate while minimally altering off-target behavior. Theoretical results indicate that the best-of-n sampling distribution is optimal regarding the trade-off between win rate and KL divergence. Experiments demonstrate that BoNBoN outperforms other methods like SFT, DPO, and IPO in dialog generation and text summarization tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with clear notations and a sufficient literature review.
- It provides a concise introduction to RLHF and DPO, establishing a solid theoretical foundation for the proposed methods.
- The experimental results support the claim that BoNBoN achieves a better win-rate versus KL divergence trade-off compared to existing approaches.

Weaknesses:
- The analysis lacks clarity, making it difficult for some readers to follow.
- The paper does not adequately address how to handle contradictory human preference ratings, limiting its applicability.
- Certain proofs, particularly in Theorem 1, require modification for mathematical accuracy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the analysis to make it more accessible to a broader audience. Additionally, it would be beneficial to explicitly discuss how BoNBoN can reflect multiple aspects of real-world preferences, such as the balance between helpfulness and harmfulness. The authors should also clarify the distinction between their work and existing literature, particularly regarding the originality of their ideas. Lastly, we suggest revising the proof of Theorem 1 to include all coefficients explicitly and ensure mathematical correctness.
