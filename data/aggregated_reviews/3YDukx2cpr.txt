Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Graph Segment Training (GST) method aimed at predicting properties of large graphs by segmenting them into subgraphs. The authors propose a memory-efficient training approach that utilizes a historical embedding table to manage subgraph representations and mitigate staleness through a dropout mechanism. The efficacy of GST and its variant GST+EFD is demonstrated through extensive experiments on multiple large-scale datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The idea of partitioning large graphs for property prediction is innovative and valuable to the graph community.
- Each component of the GST architecture, including the historical embedding table and stale embedding dropout, contributes uniquely to the learning process.
- The theoretical analysis supports the benefits of the proposed methods, which outperform traditional full graph training in terms of efficiency.
- The paper is well-written, with clear and organized content.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments focus solely on GST and its variants, lacking comparisons with other large graph training techniques.
- There is insufficient discussion on how to handle inter-segmentation training, particularly regarding link prediction between nodes from different segments.
- The limitations and potential societal impacts of the proposed method are not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including comparisons with other large graph training techniques, such as GraphSage, to evaluate the effectiveness of GST more comprehensively. Additionally, a discussion on how to manage inter-segmentation training and the implications of potential privacy risks associated with large-scale graph processing should be included. Furthermore, consider addressing the questions raised regarding the handling of connecting edges between segments and the rationale behind the loss calculations in Eq. 2.
