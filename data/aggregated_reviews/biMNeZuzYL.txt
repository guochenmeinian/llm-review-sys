### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach called Chain-of-Factors for matching paper submissions to reviewers, integrating semantic, topic, and citation factors through instruction-tuning of language models. The authors propose a unified model that aims to enhance the accuracy and scalability of reviewer assignments in academic contexts. The study includes experiments on four datasets, one of which is newly contributed by the authors, demonstrating the model's effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a rigorous methodology with comprehensive experimental validation and strong comparisons to existing methods.
- It introduces a new dataset, enhancing the research community's resources.
- The integration of multiple factors into a cohesive framework improves the precision of paper-reviewer matching.
- The approach addresses scalability issues relevant to large academic conferences.

Weaknesses:
- The problem definition lacks clarity regarding the core goal of assessing relevance, particularly concerning the role of the number of papers a potential reviewer has.
- The benchmark datasets used are outdated, raising questions about their representativeness.
- The complexity of the model and reliance on high-quality data may limit broader applicability and scalability.
- Sections discussing the model's components are not well-placed, focusing too narrowly on smaller parts without presenting the bigger picture.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the problem definition to better reflect the core goal of assessing relevance. Additionally, consider expanding Section 2.2 to provide a more comprehensive overview of related work, potentially at the expense of Section 5. The authors should also clarify the annotation process for the KDD dataset and address the missing values in Table 2. Furthermore, we suggest testing the model with more recent datasets to ensure relevance to current trends in paper submissions. Lastly, providing access to the code and datasets would greatly benefit the research community.
