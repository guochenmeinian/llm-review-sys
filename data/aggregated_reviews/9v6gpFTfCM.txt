Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the communication costs associated with unbiased compression in distributed optimization. The authors provide theoretical formulations demonstrating that unbiased compression alone does not necessarily reduce total communication costs (TCC). They establish that if compressors are also independent, the TCC can be significantly decreased. Additionally, the authors refine the analysis of the ADIANA algorithm, proving lower bounds on convergence complexity and validating their findings through simulations. The authors also discuss unbiased compressors, acknowledging that no finite-bit unbiased compressor can operate over the entire real space. They propose a refined definition for unbiased compressors, emphasizing that valid input values must be bounded and non-zero inputs must be bounded away from zero, asserting that this definition is justified in practice and does not affect the theoretical results of their work.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper identifies a critical gap in existing literature regarding the independence of compressors, providing a systematic analysis with theoretical proofs.
2. The consideration of total communication cost, factoring in both per-round costs and the number of rounds, offers a more comprehensive perspective than previous works.
3. The authors provide a novel and well-supported theoretical analysis that contributes significantly to the field.
4. The refined definition of unbiased compressors clarifies existing confusion and aligns with practical applications in machine computations.

Weaknesses:
1. The writing is dense with notation, which may hinder understanding for readers less familiar with the topic. There is a lack of clear examples or intuitions regarding the importance of independence.
2. The choice of ADIANA for analysis feels abrupt, and the authors should provide more context on why this algorithm was selected.
3. The initial definition of unbiased compressors may have caused confusion among reviewers, indicating a need for clearer communication of concepts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their writing by reducing the heavy notation and incorporating intuitive examples to illustrate the significance of independence in compressors. Additionally, it would be beneficial to provide a rationale for selecting ADIANA for analysis, perhaps by discussing the properties that make certain algorithms more likely to approach the lower bound. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the initial definition of unbiased compressors to prevent confusion and ensure that all aspects of the paper are consistent with the newly proposed definition throughout the revision process. Addressing the concerns regarding the unbiased compressor and its implications on communication costs, as raised by reviewers, would enhance the paper's robustness.
