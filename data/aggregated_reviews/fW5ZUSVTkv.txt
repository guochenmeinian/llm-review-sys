Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Domain-Aware Detection Head with Prompt Tuning (DA-Pro) framework for domain adaptive object detection (DAOD). The authors propose a vision-language model (VLM)-based backbone to extract generalized features and a domain-aware detection head utilizing domain-invariant and domain-specific tokens, along with class labels and domain-related textual descriptions. The method is evaluated across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The idea is well-expressed and reasonable, addressing an important research problem in domain adaptation.
2. The generalized semantic knowledge aids in effective prompt tuning.
3. The proposed method shows favorable performance compared to non-VLM-based DAOD methods and a VLM-based baseline.
4. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with helpful figures.

Weaknesses:
1. Methodological details are unclear, particularly regarding the training of the box head and the adaptation process for regression tasks.
2. The novelty of the work is somewhat limited, as it appears to be a straightforward extension of previous methods.
3. Evaluation is conducted on a limited set of datasets, primarily related to cityscapes, and lacks diversity in domain shifts.
4. The baseline method's details are insufficiently explained, hindering fair comparison.
5. The impact of pseudo labels and the uncertainty associated with them is not adequately discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding the methodology, specifically how the box head is trained and the adaptation process for regression tasks. Additionally, expanding the evaluation to include a wider variety of datasets, such as PASCAL VOC and Watercolor2k, would strengthen the paper's claims. It is also advisable to provide a clearer description of the baseline method's architecture and its differences from the proposed approach. Finally, discussing the role of uncertainty in pseudo labels and including error bar plots in the results would enhance the robustness of the findings.
