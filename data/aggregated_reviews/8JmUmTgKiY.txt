Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to generative adversarial networks (GANs) by generalizing the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) distance to multidimensional spaces and proposing the Kolmogorov-Smirnov GAN (KSGAN), which minimizes this distance to align generated and target distributions. The authors provide theoretical results and experimental evidence demonstrating KSGAN's stability during training, resistance to mode dropping, and tolerance to hyperparameter variations. However, the motivation for using the KS distance over existing methods like the Jensen-Shannon divergence and Wasserstein distance is not clearly articulated.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The idea of generalizing the KS distance to multidimensional spaces is innovative and well-executed.
- The paper is well-presented, with clear writing and supportive theoretical analysis.
- The experimental results indicate some advantages in stability and resistance to mode dropping.

Weaknesses:
- There is skepticism regarding the theoretical aspects, with unclear advantages of KS distance over existing metrics.
- The experimental setup is limited, primarily comparing KSGAN with vanilla GAN and WGAN on basic datasets, lacking evaluations on larger-scale datasets or advanced frameworks like StyleGAN.
- The results are underwhelming, with performance not significantly surpassing that of established models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical justification for the use of KS distance, clearly articulating its advantages over other distances. Additionally, we suggest expanding the experimental evaluation to include comparisons with state-of-the-art models like StyleGAN on larger datasets to demonstrate the practical applicability of KSGAN. Finally, the authors should consider validating their claims with targeted experiments that explore the benefits of the KS distance in various contexts, rather than focusing solely on mathematical formulations.
