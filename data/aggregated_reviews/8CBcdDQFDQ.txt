Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method named Stratified Prediction-Powered Inference (StratePPI), which leverages data stratification to enhance prediction-powered inference (PPI) by providing tighter confidence intervals compared to unstratified approaches. The authors demonstrate that appropriate stratification and sample allocation can yield substantial improvements in confidence interval estimation, supported by experimental results on both simulated and real datasets. The method also addresses evaluation bias from autoraters by aligning them with human annotations, identifying that performance varies across example groups.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The introduction of data stratification strategies to improve PPI is novel and well-articulated.  
2. The empirical evaluations across multiple datasets effectively showcase the advantages of StratePPI over existing methods.  
3. The paper is well-written and accessible, even for readers less familiar with the subdomain.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The paper lacks detailed guidance on effective data stratification methods, which is crucial for the application of StratePPI.  
2. There is confusion regarding the definitions of target outputs in the context of QA, leading to potential misunderstandings of the methodology.  
3. The evaluation datasets used are not widely recognized, and the practical benefits of the method remain unclear, raising questions about its comparative accuracy versus existing methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definitions used in the paper, particularly regarding the target outputs to avoid confusion. Additionally, we suggest including more widely used evaluation datasets to enhance the impact of the findings. It would also be beneficial for the authors to provide a more detailed explanation of the practical benefits of StratePPI, particularly how it improves accuracy in confidence interval estimation compared to traditional methods. Finally, we encourage the authors to include the results of language model evaluations in the main paper rather than relegating them to the appendix.
