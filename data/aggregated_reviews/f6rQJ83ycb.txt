Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DRIFT, a novel framework for unsupervised 3D object location detection from LIDAR data in autonomous driving contexts. The authors propose a method that enhances the MODEST baseline by integrating heuristics for assessing objectness likelihood, utilized as rewards in a reinforcement learning framework. Evaluations on the LYFT and Ithaca benchmarks indicate that DRIFT achieves superior performance and training efficiency compared to the MODEST baseline. The framework is described as simple yet effective, demonstrating its novelty through various ablation studies. The authors acknowledge the potential to expand their reward and exploration functions to incorporate additional modes of information, such as language, in future works. They emphasize the strategic use of domain knowledge for hyperparameter selection, allowing for scalability in unsupervised learning without requiring extensive human involvement.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and effectively tackles the under-explored issue of unsupervised 3D object detection, demonstrating potential real-world applications.
- The logical grounding of the proposed method, particularly the use of shape, size, and location priors to assess objectness likelihood, aligns with human intuition and supports a feedback loop for performance improvement.
- Significant performance improvements are reported, with DRIFT outperforming MODEST despite training for only 30 epochs.
- The integration of domain knowledge for hyperparameter tuning enhances scalability.
- The authors are open to future expansions of their method, indicating a forward-thinking approach.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks context within the established objectness literature, which could have provided valuable insights and techniques relevant to the authors' objectives.
- The derivation and selection process for the shape templates (priors, prototypes) is unclear, necessitating further explanation.
- The investigation of cross-dataset generalization from LYFT to Ithaca is missing, which would enhance understanding of the method's robustness across different driving scenes.
- The reliance on heuristics raises concerns about their effectiveness, particularly for pedestrian detection, suggesting a need for more sophisticated designs.
- There is a lack of exploration of how to incorporate language into the current framework, which may limit its applicability.
- The current reward formulation is noted as simple, suggesting potential for further sophistication.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify from the outset that their goal is to identify generic object regions rather than categorization, as the term "Object Discovery" may confuse readers expecting a semantic categorization component. Additionally, providing a detailed explanation of how the shape templates were generated would strengthen the paper. Investigating cross-dataset generalization would also be beneficial to assess the robustness of the method. We suggest exploring more advanced heuristics to improve performance on challenging categories, such as pedestrians. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the discussion on how to incorporate language into their reward and exploration functions, as this could enhance the framework's applicability. Exploring more sophisticated reward formulations could further strengthen the method's effectiveness.
