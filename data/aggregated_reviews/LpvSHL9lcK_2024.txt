Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents implicitly rewired message-passing neural networks (IPR-MPNNs) to overcome limitations in traditional message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs), specifically addressing issues of under-reaching and over-squashing. The authors propose a method that integrates implicit probabilistic graph rewiring by introducing a small number of virtual nodes, enabling long-distance message propagation without incurring the quadratic complexity associated with graph transformers. The authors acknowledge the quadratic worst-case complexity of their model, which is only quadratic in the number of virtual nodes and not necessarily in the number of original nodes. They argue that their method effectively mitigates information bottlenecks through a hierarchical, heterogeneous message-passing scheme, demonstrating competitive performance with fewer virtual nodes. Empirical results indicate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets, particularly in molecular and heterophilic contexts, supported by robust comparisons with various rewiring methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of implicit probabilistic graph rewiring via virtual nodes is a novel contribution that addresses traditional MPNN limitations without the high computational cost of graph transformers.
- The authors provide a theoretical analysis showing that IPR-MPNNs exceed the expressive capacity of standard MPNNs, typically limited by the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm.
- The probabilistic layer effectively reduces information bottlenecks, allowing for efficient long-range information passing.
- Empirical results are robust, showing improvements in runtime and memory usage compared to existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The related work section lacks structure and detail, failing to adequately discuss significant contributions from prior research on oversquashing and graph rewiring.
- The novelty of the method is questioned, as it combines previously proposed concepts of virtual nodes and probabilistic message passing without sufficient justification of its unique contributions.
- The theoretical claims regarding alleviating over-smoothing and over-squashing are primarily based on empirical analysis without direct theoretical proof.
- The paper does not thoroughly connect how virtual nodes mitigate oversquashing and does not address the limitations of virtual nodes in this context.
- The methodology is primarily empirical, with theoretical contributions lacking depth and clarity regarding their relevance to the problem of oversquashing.
- The paper lacks comprehensive comparisons with certain relevant works, particularly [ARZ22], [GR24], and [SN24], which could strengthen the discussion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section by providing a more structured and detailed discussion of significant prior research, particularly focusing on limitations related to oversquashing and the contributions of existing rewiring methods. Additionally, the authors should clarify the novelty of their approach, explicitly stating how it advances the field beyond existing concepts of virtual nodes and probabilistic message passing.

We suggest that the authors conduct a more thorough theoretical analysis of how their method addresses oversquashing, potentially referencing works such as Southern 2024 and Geisler 2024 for insights. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to include experiments on node-level tasks to demonstrate the applicability of IPR-MPNNs in contexts requiring long-range interactions.

We also recommend that the authors improve the discussion of connections with [GR24] and [SN24], emphasizing both similarities and differences. Additionally, we suggest lowering claims about solving over-smoothing and over-squashing, framing them as results of empirical work rather than definitive conclusions. Incorporating a measurement based on Dirichlet Energy could provide further insights into the model's performance regarding over-smoothing. Lastly, including the number of virtual nodes as a fraction of the total number of nodes would enhance the understanding of scaling in the results.
