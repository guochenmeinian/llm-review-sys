Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Doubly Robust Augmented Transfer (DRaT) algorithm, an innovative extension of hindsight-based transfer methods that addresses both reward mismatches and discrepancies in transition dynamics. The authors provide a theoretical analysis establishing the optimality of their interval-based approximation, the Doubly Robust Augmented Estimator (DRaE), for calculating optimal importance sampling weights. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that DRaT outperforms traditional hindsight-based methods, particularly in sparse-reward MuJoCo tasks with varying reward structures and dynamics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The study addresses a critical yet underexplored aspect of transfer learning, emphasizing the importance of calculating optimal dynamics importance weights.  
- It presents a solid theoretical foundation and an innovative interval-based approximation method, ensuring reliability and efficacy.  
- The comprehensive empirical evaluation across diverse scenarios showcases substantial improvements over all baselines, affirming the algorithm's effectiveness and robustness.  

Weaknesses:  
- The computational overhead associated with calculating the doubly robust estimate and training the dynamics network is a notable drawback. A comparison of wall-clock time for each method would provide insights into performance versus computational costs.  
- The paper lacks details regarding the number of seeds used for evaluation, which is essential for reliable assessment in meta-RL.  
- The authors do not discuss potential strategies or optimizations to enhance computational efficiency, which would be valuable given the method's overhead.  
- Missing details about the meta-RL setting in experiments, including the range of environment parameters and differences in reward functions, limit the clarity of the evaluation.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental setup by providing details on the number of seeds used for evaluation and the specific ranges of environment parameters. Additionally, we suggest including a comparison of wall-clock times for each method to better assess computational efficiency. It would also be beneficial to discuss any strategies or optimizations considered to enhance computational efficiency without compromising effectiveness. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide a more extensive evaluation, potentially using the MetaWorld benchmark, to rigorously test the DRaT method across a wider range of scenarios.
