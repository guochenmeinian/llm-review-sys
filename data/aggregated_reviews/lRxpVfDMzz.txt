Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents eXtensible Prompt (X-Prompt), a novel technique that instructs a Language Model (LM) using an extensible vocabulary of imaginary words, designed to enhance the expressiveness of prompts beyond natural language. The authors propose context-augmented learning (CAL) to facilitate the learning of these imaginary words, aiming for robustness in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Through various experiments, the authors evaluate X-Prompt's effectiveness in styled text generation and style transfer, demonstrating both quantitative and qualitative advantages over traditional soft prompt methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of X-Prompt as an extension of soft prompt methods offers notable flexibility and adaptability, particularly for OOD examples.
2. The context-augmented learning methodology effectively generates additional training examples, showcasing versatility across prompt learning experiments.
3. The paper is well-structured and includes informative diagrams and examples that enhance comprehension.
4. Comprehensive evaluation methods, including quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments, provide a thorough analysis of the proposed approach.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks novelty, primarily extending existing soft prompt solutions without significant new contributions, which may not meet the standards for a NeurIPS submission.
2. The experimental scope is limited to style transfer tasks; broader evaluations across various tasks would better demonstrate the method's versatility.
3. Concerns regarding model performance and content faithfulness arise, as X-Prompt's content scores are lower than natural language prompts, indicating potential issues in generating appropriate content.
4. The absence of sufficient baseline comparisons, particularly with natural language instructions, undermines the robustness of the evaluation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their contribution by framing their work as a deeper exploration of the interaction between text and soft prompts, incorporating relevant literature to support their claims. Expanding the experimental scope to include a wider range of tasks, similar to the prefix-tuning approach, would further showcase the versatility of X-Prompt. Additionally, we suggest including more robust baseline comparisons with natural language prompts to strengthen the evaluation of X-Prompt's performance. Finally, addressing concerns regarding content faithfulness and providing more detailed explanations of the prompt engineering process would enhance the clarity and impact of the paper.
