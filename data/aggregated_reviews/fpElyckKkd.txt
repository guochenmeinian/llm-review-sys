Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel end-to-end distance learning method aimed at enhancing downstream prediction tasks through the selection of geometric spaces, including Euclidean, projected sphere, and Poincare ball types. The authors propose a sparsely-gated MOE technique for the selection process and introduce balancing regularization terms to stabilize training. The method's performance is evaluated through matrix completion and link prediction tasks, showing improvements over existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed idea demonstrates originality through a creative combination of existing concepts, and the algorithm design is reasonable.  
- The approach improves upon previous manifold learning methods by incorporating curved manifolds, and the use of gyrovector machinery is intriguing.  
- Experimental results indicate success in learning geometry from data, particularly in matrix completion and link prediction tasks.

Weaknesses:  
- The writing lacks clarity, with sections repeating prior work without sufficient originality or depth.  
- The design motivations for the regularization terms are inadequately explained, particularly for \( l_2 \).  
- The experimental section lacks comparisons with state-of-the-art results, making it difficult to assess the significance of the proposed method.  
- There is insufficient exploration of the potential of geometric representation learning beyond performance improvement.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing, particularly in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, by avoiding repetition of previous work and providing a more detailed explanation of their proposed method. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the construction of candidate geometric spaces and the computation of distances using tangent vectors. It would be beneficial to include comparisons with state-of-the-art results in matrix completion and link prediction to better highlight the value of their approach. We also recommend performing ablation studies to examine the effects of \( l_1 \) and \( l_2 \) regularization terms. Finally, a more in-depth discussion on the implications and potential applications of geometric representation learning would enhance the contribution of the paper.
