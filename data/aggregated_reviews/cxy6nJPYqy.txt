### Key Points
This paper presents a novel span-based model designed for the dialogue-level aspect-based sentiment analysis (DiaASQ) task. The authors propose a span-pair tagging schema to address limitations of previous methods, which suffer from incomplete span-level interaction and modeling. The study introduces an efficient span pruning strategy to reduce complexity and employs a multi-level representation model to enhance dialogue feature modeling. Experimental results indicate a performance improvement exceeding 5% in F1 score across two benchmarks, validating the model's effectiveness in complex scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The methods leverage span-level representation and interaction, marking a significant advancement over prior token-based approaches.
- The proposed methods demonstrate substantial performance improvements, showcasing the robustness of the model.
- An effective pruning method enhances time efficiency, making the model suitable for real-world applications.
- The paper is well-written, with a clear methodology that facilitates understanding and encourages further research.

Weaknesses:
- There are inconsistencies in the description of the time complexity of GTS-Dia, leading to confusion about its computational efficiency.
- The paper lacks a clear distinction from previous works, such as Span-ASTE, which diminishes the understanding of its unique contributions.
- The quadruple decoding process is not adequately discussed, leaving core components unclear.
- Some conclusions are presented without sufficient justification, leading to confusion regarding comparisons made in the text.
- Overuse of notations without proper introduction complicates comprehension of the proposed methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the actual time complexity of GTS-Dia, particularly regarding the discrepancies noted in the paper. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed comparison with previous works, especially Span-ASTE, to highlight the unique contributions of the proposed methods. It would be beneficial to enhance the discussion on the quadruple decoding process to ensure it is self-contained. We also advise the authors to justify their claims more thoroughly and to introduce notations clearly to improve readability and comprehension. Finally, expanding the evaluation to include multiple benchmarks would demonstrate the model's generalizability.
