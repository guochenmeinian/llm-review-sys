Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Lumina-Next, an enhanced version of Lumina-T2X, which utilizes a Flow-based Large Diffusion Transformer (Flag-DiT) architecture. Key innovations include the introduction of a redesigned Next-DiT architecture with 3D Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and sandwich normalization to enhance training stability and inference efficiency. The authors propose Frequency- and Time-Aware Scaled RoPE for improved resolution extrapolation and an optimized time discretization schedule combined with higher-order Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solvers for faster, high-quality generation across various modalities, including text-to-image and audio.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a comprehensive empirical analysis of the training stability, inference efficiency, and extrapolation performance of the Flow-based Large Diffusion Transformer.
- The introduction of 3D RoPE and sandwich normalization significantly contributes to stabilizing training and enhancing extrapolation capabilities.
- Lumina-Next demonstrates strong performance in text-to-image generation and shows versatility across multiple tasks with minimal modifications.

Weaknesses:
- The necessity of identifiers like [nextline] and [nextframe] when using 3D RoPE is not adequately addressed.
- There is a lack of comparative analysis with stable-diffusion-3 and insufficient quantitative evaluations across all generation tasks.
- The proposed Time Schedule's applicability at low NFEs (<10) is unclear, with limited examples in Figure 7 and no numerical comparisons provided.
- The improvements over Lumina-T2X appear incremental, and the advantages of 3D RoPE over existing designs are not convincingly demonstrated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the necessity of identifiers such as [nextline] and [nextframe] in the context of 3D RoPE. Additionally, the authors should include comparisons with stable-diffusion-3 and provide comprehensive quantitative evaluations across all generation tasks. It would be beneficial to clarify the applicability of the proposed Time Schedule at low NFEs by including more examples and numerical comparisons. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors address the incremental nature of their improvements over Lumina-T2X and provide clearer justifications for the advantages of 3D RoPE and the reduction in model size. Lastly, incorporating quadratic evaluation metrics such as TIFA and ImageReward scores would enhance the fairness of comparisons across models.
