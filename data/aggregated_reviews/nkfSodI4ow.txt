Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents XYZ Data Efficiency, a framework aimed at enhancing data efficiency in training large models through curriculum learning and data routing techniques. The authors implement an efficient difficulty metric calculation using map-reduce and propose random-LTD, a method that drops different tokens across Transformer layers. The framework claims to achieve baseline accuracy with less data or improved accuracy with the same data. The evaluation includes various foundation models, demonstrating substantial efficiency gains.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The development of a general, efficient, and user-friendly framework for curriculum learning in large models is a novel contribution.
- The random-LTD technique is well-designed and appears to enhance the performance of large Transformers across tasks.
- The open-sourced CL-based library is compatible with PyTorch, facilitating broader accessibility.

Weaknesses:
- Random-LTD is argued to be more akin to regularization than a true data efficiency method, raising concerns about its classification.
- The practical utility of map-reduce for data difficulty calculation is questioned, as it relies on offline metrics that may not significantly benefit practitioners.
- The framework lacks flexibility and modularity, limiting user customization in learning rate scheduling and data sampling strategies.
- The evaluation is limited to a few models, and the paper does not adequately address the overhead associated with data sampling and routing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the relationship between random-LTD and data efficiency, potentially reframing it to avoid misleading implications. Additionally, providing a discussion on the limitations of the map-reduce approach and its practical implications would enhance the paper's value. We suggest including a broader range of models in the evaluation to strengthen the findings' generalizability. Furthermore, addressing the flexibility of the framework regarding learning rate scheduling and user-defined strategies would improve user experience. Lastly, we encourage the authors to submit the anonymized code to support their claims of open-sourcing the framework.
