Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on structured neural networks (strNN) that impose known conditional independence structures in fully-connected architectures, particularly for autoregressive normalizing flows. The authors propose a method for creating weight masks based on a factorization of an adjacency matrix to enhance generalization. Empirical results demonstrate improvements over baseline models, including comparisons with MADE and other approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The manuscript is well-written, with clear definitions of contributions and explicit assumptions regarding the adjacency matrix.
- The proposed method for imposing conditional independences is sound and supported by experimental results showing improved generalization.
- The introduction of a greedy algorithm for mask creation is a practical enhancement for larger graphs.

Weaknesses:
- The approach is conceptually similar to prior work by Wehenkel and Louppe (2021), which raises concerns about originality.
- The empirical section is limited compared to other studies, potentially undermining the robustness of the claims.
- The paper does not address how to learn the global adjacency matrix or explore the implications of shared weights in the network.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the similarities with Wehenkel and Louppe (2021) to clarify the novelty of their approach. Additionally, expanding the empirical evaluation to include a broader range of datasets would strengthen the paper's claims. We suggest addressing the limitations of the method regarding the global adjacency matrix and exploring the implications of shared weights in causal mechanisms. Finally, clarifying the distinctions between "density estimation" and "sample quality" in Table 1 would enhance the manuscript's clarity.
