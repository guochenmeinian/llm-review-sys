Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method called CA-SSLR that integrates conditioning into pre-trained Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models for various speech-processing tasks. The authors propose a hierarchical self-conditioning mechanism that utilizes intermediate language and speaker embeddings to enhance the performance of the SSL model. The method is evaluated using the multilingual SUPERB benchmark, demonstrating significant improvements in automatic speech recognition (ASR), language identification (LID), and speaker verification (SV).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is novel in reusing decoders multiple times for incremental conditioning.
- The framework is adaptable for various speech tasks, allowing for the selection of conditioning decoders based on target tasks.
- Strong experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in multilingual ASR.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation is subpar for NeurIPS standards, with unclear methodology and redundant content across sections.
- The complexity of the system may increase inference costs, particularly when tasks depend on one another.
- There is a lack of comparison with state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, leaving gaps in understanding the proposed method's performance relative to existing approaches.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology section by avoiding redundancy and providing a more detailed explanation of the proposed TCAC and its integration within the SSL model. Additionally, we suggest including a comparison with SOTA results to contextualize the performance of CA-SSLR. It would be beneficial to streamline the experimental setup and provide clearer references to the appendix for experimental details. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the conditions under which attention is necessary and to visualize attention mechanisms with examples. Lastly, addressing minor formatting issues and ensuring consistent citation styles will enhance the overall presentation quality.
