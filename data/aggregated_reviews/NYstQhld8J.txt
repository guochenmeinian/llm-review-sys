### Key Points
This paper presents a new task, NR-KBQA, which emphasizes numerical reasoning combined with multi-hop reasoning. The authors construct a large-scale dataset, MarkQA, consisting of 32K examples with QDMR question decomposition and corresponding logic forms in Python, termed PyQL. PyQL facilitates a step-by-step reasoning process and can be compiled into executable SPARQL queries. The authors argue that existing KBQA datasets lack sufficient numerical reasoning questions, thus highlighting a gap in the field.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The focus on numerical reasoning is a significant contribution to the NLP field, addressing an important challenge.
- MarkQA serves as a valuable resource for future research, providing a comprehensive dataset for evaluating numerical reasoning in KBQA.
- The paper is well-written and presents a strong motivation for the proposed work.

Weaknesses:
- The main contribution of the paper is unclear, particularly regarding its classification as a resource paper versus a novel contribution.
- There is a lack of comprehensive experiments, including insufficient baselines and no ablation analyses for the numerical reasoning aspect.
- Some proposed questions may introduce unnecessary complexity, which could detract from practical applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their main contribution claims, particularly in distinguishing between resource and novel contributions. A detailed formulation of a sample in MarkQA should be provided, rather than relying solely on Figure 2. Additionally, the authors should include more comprehensive experiments with additional baselines and conduct ablation analyses specifically for the numerical reasoning component. To enhance the dataset's realism, consider simplifying overly complex questions and providing more examples of numerical complexity not present in prior datasets.
