### Key Points
This paper presents the restarted Bayesian online change-point detection (R-BOCPD) framework. The authors propose a method that aims to improve upon existing GP-based models for change-point detection. The experimental validation is noted as robust, but the paper lacks clarity in several areas, particularly regarding the theoretical justification and empirical results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-organized and presents a potentially useful extension to the R-BOCPD framework.  
- The suite of empirical tests is compelling.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper is incomplete and poorly organized, lacking sufficient explanation of key concepts, particularly in Section 2.2.  
- There is inadequate justification for claims of theoretical interpretability and insufficient detail on dataset composition and metrics.  
- The organization of sections and appendices is unclear, with some content deemed unnecessary.  
- The abstract's promise of reproducible code is misleading if not provided.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 2.2 by providing a detailed explanation of their methodology, including justifications for their claims. It would be beneficial to expand the discussion on the limitations of the model and address scalability for real-time applications. The authors should specify the dataset composition and metrics used in their empirical tests, as well as clarify the "Delay" metric. Additionally, we suggest that the authors compare their method with traditional BOCPD to highlight its value. The organization of the paper could be enhanced by integrating relevant content from the appendices into the main text and ensuring that all references are correctly cited without duplication. Finally, if reproducible code is available, it should be linked in the paper; if not, this should be mentioned under "Future Work."
