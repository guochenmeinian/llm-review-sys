Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for recognizing keysteps in instructional videos by constructing a task graph from automatically mined data. The task graph captures dependencies between keysteps, moving beyond the strict linear ordering required in prior work. The authors propose using this graph for keystep recognition, task recognition, and keystep forecasting, demonstrating its utility across multiple tasks, including key step forecasting and task classification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The task graph mining approach alleviates the need for a predetermined linear order of keysteps, enhancing flexibility.
- The method shows effectiveness in improving video representation for related tasks, indicating a broader applicability.
- The authors demonstrate a clear understanding of instructional video dynamics, particularly noted in their insights on lines 42-45.

Weaknesses:
- There is a lack of clarity regarding the supervision used in comparison to prior works, complicating the assessment of baseline suitability.
- The predefined keystep vocabulary is introduced late in the method section, leading to confusion.
- The differences in supervision compared to works like [70], [82], and [84] are inadequately explained, necessitating a clearer comparison.
- The importance of the keystep vocabulary's cleanliness is not evaluated, raising questions about robustness to noise.
- Visualization of the task graph is limited, with only a small portion shown, and a full visualization in supplementary materials would be beneficial.
- The paper does not adequately compare with contemporaneous work such as Paprika [85], which addresses similar goals.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding the supervision used in their method compared to prior works, particularly [44], [82], and [84]. The authors should explain the significance of the keystep vocabulary and its robustness to noise, potentially including experiments to assess performance degradation with larger vocabularies. Additionally, we suggest including a full visualization of the task graph in supplementary materials to enhance understanding. A comparison with Paprika [85] should be included to clarify the advantages of the proposed method. Finally, addressing the potential negative societal impacts of the dataset and model deployment would strengthen the paper.
