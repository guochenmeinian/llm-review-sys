Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DreamSteerer, a plug-in method designed to enhance the editability of source images in text-to-image (T2I) personalization. The authors propose the Editability Driven Score Distillation (EDSD) objective to improve structural alignment between source and edited images, addressing mode-trapping issues through regularization with spatial feature-guided sampling. The method includes modifications to the Delta Denoising Score framework for high-fidelity local editing with personalized concepts. Extensive experiments validate the method's effectiveness across various T2I personalization baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem of enhancing editability in personalized image editing is significant and underexplored, making the proposed method original and relevant.
- The method is model-agnostic and demonstrates solid quantitative results, showing effectiveness over three baselines.
- The presentation is reasonably clear, with well-organized qualitative and quantitative analyses.

Weaknesses:
- The method lacks comparisons with editing baselines outside of personalization and does not adequately compare to preliminary works, leading to questions about its relative performance.
- The effectiveness of the "mode shifting regularization" approach is not convincingly demonstrated, particularly in the provided figures.
- Important evaluation metrics are missing, such as image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, and the paper does not analyze the computational overhead compared to base personalization methods.
- The resolution of example images is low, which may hinder the assessment of results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparative analysis by including editing baselines outside of personalization and conducting qualitative or quantitative comparisons with cited preliminary works. Additionally, we suggest providing a clearer justification for the effectiveness of the "mode shifting regularization" approach and including relevant IQA metrics for a more comprehensive evaluation. It would be beneficial to analyze and report the computational overhead of the proposed method compared to base personalization methods like DreamBooth. Lastly, we encourage the authors to enhance the resolution of example images to better showcase the results.
