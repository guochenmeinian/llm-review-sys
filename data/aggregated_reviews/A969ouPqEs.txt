Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DiffLight, a conditional diffusion model that integrates traffic data imputation and decision-making for Traffic Signal Control (TSC) under conditions of missing data. It introduces a partial rewards conditioned diffusion method to mitigate the negative impacts of missing data, employs a spatial-temporal transformer architecture to model spatiotemporal dependencies, and proposes a diffusion communication mechanism for coordinated control among intersections. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of DiffLight.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a significant issue in traffic signal control related to missing data, providing practical solutions that are often overlooked in urban traffic scenarios.  
- The unification of traffic data imputation and decision-making in a single model is innovative, and the design of the partial reward conditional diffusion method is novel, demonstrating theoretical feasibility.  
- The spatial-temporal transformer architecture effectively captures dependencies between intersections, and the diffusion communication mechanism enhances cooperative control in challenging scenarios.  
- The paper is well-written, clearly structured, and presents rigorous experimental validation of the proposed methods.

Weaknesses:  
- The explanation of how the Diffusion Communication Mechanism (DCM) facilitates information exchange among intersections during data loss is insufficiently detailed.  
- The study is limited to two common missing data patterns, suggesting a need for exploration of a broader range of scenarios, including mixed missing data.  
- Some symbols are improperly defined, leading to potential confusion, such as the inconsistent definitions of \(\tau\) and \(\tau_{i}\).  
- The comparative analysis lacks benchmarks against state-of-the-art methods like "MissLight," which is crucial for establishing the proposed approach's efficacy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the Diffusion Communication Mechanism (DCM) by providing specific examples of its operation during missing data scenarios. Additionally, the authors should consider expanding their analysis to include a wider variety of missing data patterns beyond the two currently examined. It is also essential to correct the definitions of symbols used in the paper for consistency and clarity. Furthermore, we suggest incorporating a comparative analysis against relevant baseline methods, such as "MissLight," to strengthen the validation of the proposed approach. Lastly, including a requirements or setup file for the dependencies used in the experiments would enhance reproducibility.
