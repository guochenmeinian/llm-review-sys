### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for factorization in vector-symbolic architecture (VSA) on digital memory devices, primarily aimed at mitigating the limit cycle problem that leads to undesired local minima. The authors devise a noise injection procedure utilizing asymmetric random bit flip, providing an alternative source of stochasticity compared to the intrinsic noise used in analog memory devices. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing noise induction methods when the number of factors is small. The significance of factorization in VSA is emphasized due to its relevance to non-von-Neumann computing paradigms and AI tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed method effectively addresses the limit cycle problem in VSA.  
- Numerical experiments validate the algorithm's superior performance with a small number of factors.  
- The research is timely and relevant to emerging computing paradigms.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks clarity regarding whether experiments were conducted via software simulation or on physical hardware.  
- The comparison of algorithms in Fig. 3 may confuse readers about ACF's advantages over IMF without real-time execution time data.  
- The term "more performant" is vague and requires clarification regarding specific metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper's readability by clarifying whether the experiments were conducted as a software simulation or on physical hardware. Additionally, we suggest including a real-time execution time comparison against IMF to better illustrate ACF's advantages. Finally, we encourage the authors to specify the measures by which the combination of IMF and ACF becomes "more performant," such as operation capacity, number of iterations, or accuracy.
