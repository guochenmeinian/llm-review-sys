### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for generating synthetic data to train error correction models for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. The authors propose a technique that mimics the error distribution of ASR models, leading to significant performance improvements in training error correction models. The study demonstrates that the error distribution learned from one ASR model can enhance the performance of another ASR model's transcription. Additionally, the paper highlights the importance of adjusting vocabulary size and token length for optimal language-specific data synthesis, outperforming traditional language model-based post-processing methods for error correction.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a clear description of the synthetic data generation technique aligned with ASR error distributions.
- Comprehensive ablation studies across popular languages and ASR models demonstrate the proposed approach's effectiveness.
- The ability to transfer error distributions across different ASR models is intriguing and of high interest to the community.
- The study covers multiple languages, showcasing the language-dependent nature of optimal tokenizer vocabulary size and token length.
- The findings and contributions are discussed clearly and coherently.

Weaknesses:
- The potential transferability of error distributions across different ASR models is not thoroughly analyzed, which could be seen as a limitation.
- The effectiveness of the approach is primarily demonstrated on a subset of languages, raising concerns about the generalizability of the results.
- Some details necessary for reproducibility are lacking, potentially affecting the broader applicability of the approach.
- The reasons behind the contextual nature of insertion errors versus deletions and substitutions require further elaboration.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the transferability of error distributions obtained from the XLS-R model to the Whisper model by providing more detailed analyses, such as model architecture, training objectives, and error statistics. Additionally, we suggest that the authors address the generalizability of their results by evaluating their approach on a broader range of languages. To enhance reproducibility, the authors should include more detailed methodological descriptions. Finally, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the contextual nature of insertion errors compared to deletions and substitutions.
