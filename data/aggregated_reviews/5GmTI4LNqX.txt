Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to understanding how adversarially trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) can generate image perturbations that significantly alter human perception of object categories. The authors demonstrate that these perturbations, particularly under a low pixel budget of 30, can effectively disrupt human categorization, challenging the assumption that human perception is robust against such small-scale changes. The study reveals the existence of "wormholes" in image space that facilitate these perceptual shifts, suggesting that adversarially trained networks can produce semantically meaningful alterations that align with human visual processing. Furthermore, the authors explore the concept of "wormholes" as potentially naturally occurring phenomena in natural images, proposing that it may be feasible to identify a natural image that fits within the 30-pixel budget and disrupts the category, particularly with carefully selected starting images. They acknowledge the vast number of candidate images available, which exceeds millions, and assert that there are models capable of efficiently locating perceptual wormholes near arbitrary starting images.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides compelling evidence that adversarially trained networks can generate low-budget perturbations that disrupt human categorization, aligning human and network responses.
- The methodology is solid, with thorough experiments and clear presentation.
- The exploration of human perceptual wormholes from robustified ANNs offers intriguing insights into visual processing.
- The authors acknowledge the complexity and vastness of the candidate image space, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the problem.
- They express a willingness to engage with relevant past literature, indicating a collaborative spirit in advancing the field.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the findings is questioned, as the results may not be surprising given the established understanding of adversarial training.
- The paper lacks clarity regarding the implications of using a pixel budget of 30, and the significance of this threshold is not well-explained.
- Terminology inconsistencies, such as the use of "robustified models," may mislead readers; a more standard term like "adversarially trained models" is recommended.
- The claim regarding the efficiency of the search for natural wormholes lacks prior demonstration, which may weaken the argument.
- The interpretation of "semantically meaningful" in relation to category report changes could benefit from further clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization of the paper by presenting methods before results to enhance clarity. Additionally, we suggest revising Figure 2's caption to accurately reflect the content of the figure and ensuring consistent use of pixel budget terminology throughout the paper. Clarifying the significance of the pixel budget of 30 in relation to human perception and providing a more detailed discussion of the concept of "wormholes" would strengthen the paper. We also recommend that the authors improve the demonstration of the efficiency of their search methods for natural wormholes, providing concrete examples or comparisons to existing literature. Lastly, we suggest that the authors clarify their definition of "semantically meaningful" to enhance understanding of its implications for category report changes.
