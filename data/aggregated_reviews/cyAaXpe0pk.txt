### Key Points
This paper presents MoDis, a novel metric for evaluating pseudo-label reliability in semi-supervised graph learning by measuring the entropy of softmax predictions over training epochs. The authors conduct extensive experiments demonstrating MoDis's effectiveness compared to existing methods. They also address limitations, including additional space complexity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- MoDis is a clever and effective approach for ensuring pseudo-label reliability.
- The paper is well-written, clearly conveying the key ideas.
- Extensive experiments validate the proposed method's performance.
- The authors provide an honest discussion of their method's limitations.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of MoDis is questioned due to similarities with existing methods like SELFIE.
- The paper lacks a theoretical analysis to support MoDis's effectiveness.
- There is no hyperparameter sensitivity analysis for the threshold $\tau$ and memory bank size.
- Some experimental results are reported without error bars, making statistical significance unclear.
- Certain notations and organizational aspects of the methodology could be improved.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis to substantiate the effectiveness of MoDis. Additionally, the authors should evaluate MoDis against other pseudo-labeling methods and clarify the observed decrease in classification accuracy when using Confidence and AUM. Conducting experiments on hyperparameter sensitivity and including error bars in results would enhance the robustness of their findings. Finally, we suggest refining the organization of the methodology section for better coherence.
