### Key Points
This paper presents an approach to infer environments for invariant learning without explicit annotations, improving upon prior works that depend on pre-defined environments. The authors propose constructing a curated dataset to reduce reliance on spurious correlations, comparing models trained on this dataset with those trained on the original dataset and with Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM). The method's effectiveness is evaluated primarily on the ColoredMNIST dataset, raising questions about its generalizability to more complex datasets and scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The accuracy results are averages over 10 runs, providing insight into expected variation.  
- The automated construction of the curated dataset eliminates the need for manual sample selection.  
- The problem statement is clear and well-defined, with a thorough discussion of potential future work.  

Weaknesses:  
- The experiments are limited to binary classification, lacking validation in multi-class settings.  
- There is no clearly marked conclusion, and several sections contain unclear writing, particularly regarding the differences between Empirical Risk Minimization and Invariant Risk Minimization.  
- The reliance on strong spurious correlations raises concerns about performance in scenarios with weaker correlations, and the method's limitations in high-dimensional spaces are not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors extend their analysis to more complex, real-world datasets to validate the generalizability of their approach. It would be beneficial to include a section analyzing situations where the method fails or performs suboptimally. We suggest clarifying the differences between Empirical Risk Minimization and Invariant Risk Minimization by explicitly stating the optimization problem for Empirical Risk Minimization. Additionally, we recommend rewriting the first sentence of the abstract for clarity regarding the term "environments" and ensuring full names are used upon first mention. Improving the clarity and structure of the method section will enhance understanding and highlight contributions more effectively. Finally, we encourage the authors to address how the method could be extended to multi-class classification or to mention this as a limitation.
