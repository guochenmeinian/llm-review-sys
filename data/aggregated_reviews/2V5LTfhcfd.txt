Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on transportability in domain generalization, proposing a method to estimate the worst-case error of classifiers in target domains using shared causal mechanisms across multiple datasets. The authors introduce canonical Structural Causal Models (SCMs) and Neural Causal Models (NCM) to derive error bounds, alongside a novel approach called Causal Robust Optimization (CRO) aimed at minimizing worst-case risk. While experiments are conducted with NCM, the CRO approach is not implemented.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and provides a solid background on SCMs and graph terminology, making it accessible to non-experts.
- The importance of the problem and the principled approach to tackle it are commendable.
- The introduction of partial transportability and the use of canonical SCMs is a novel contribution, supported by solid theoretical results and illustrative examples.

Weaknesses:
- Some theoretical results, particularly in Theorem 2, lack clarity regarding the expressive power of NCMs, raising concerns about the validity of the upper bound. The optimization problem's finite-sample formulation versus its expectation conclusion is also questionable.
- The discussion on canonical SCMs is confusing, particularly regarding which types can be expressed in canonical form.
- Certain sections, especially lines 270 to 289 and Algorithm 1, are difficult to understand, necessitating clearer exposition.
- The CRO algorithm, while interesting, is not implemented in experiments, and its applicability remains uncertain.
- The paper's conclusion and experimental sections feel less polished compared to the background, which detracts from their significance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of theoretical results, particularly addressing the expressive power of NCMs in Theorem 2 and ensuring consistency between finite-sample and expectation formulations. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the discussion on canonical SCMs to enhance reader understanding. The authors should also refine sections that are hard to parse, particularly lines 270 to 289 and Algorithm 1, to facilitate comprehension. Implementing the CRO approach in experiments would provide valuable insights into its applicability, especially regarding the Colored MNIST dataset. Finally, we encourage the authors to polish the conclusion and experimental sections to better highlight their importance.
