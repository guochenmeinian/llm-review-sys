Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to open-world semi-supervised learning (OSSL) through the Taxonomic Context Priors Discovering and Aligning (TIDA) framework. TIDA utilizes multi-granularity labels to enhance representation learning and improve pseudo-label quality by leveraging hierarchical supervision. The method includes a taxonomic context discovery module for constructing hierarchical prototypes and a prediction alignment module to ensure consistency across predictions. Experimental results across seven datasets indicate that TIDA achieves significant performance improvements over existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation for using multi-granularity priors in OSSL is clear and compelling, emphasizing their role in feature extraction.
2. The writing is clear, and the figures effectively illustrate the concepts.
3. Comprehensive experiments validate the proposed method's effectiveness, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

Weaknesses:
1. The necessity of constructing taxonomic priors is unclear, as existing methods could extract such priors, raising questions about their essentiality.
2. The paper does not adequately cite or compare with relevant works on taxonomic structures.
3. The introduction lacks high-level statements on the construction and correctness of taxonomic priors, which are only found in the methodology section.
4. The method's reliance on known class numbers is unrealistic for practical applications, and the evaluation of unknown classes is limited.
5. The base networks tested are restricted to ResNet-18/-50, and additional modern networks should be included for a more robust evaluation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the necessity of constructing taxonomic priors and provide specific scenarios where they are essential. Additionally, a more thorough comparison with related works, particularly [2], should be included. The authors should also address the limitations of known class numbers in practical applications and consider testing with a wider range of modern networks. Furthermore, clarifying the reasons for performance degradation when using TCP alone and discussing the variability of super-classes and sub-classes across datasets would enhance the paper's robustness. Lastly, correcting typos and ensuring proper citation of related works will improve the overall quality of the manuscript.
