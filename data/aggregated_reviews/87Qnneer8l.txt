Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel data-generation method aimed at enhancing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection through an auxiliary task-based approach, termed Auxiliary Task-based OOD Learning (ATOL). The authors propose generating in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples using regions of disjoint latent space, ensuring that these samples have disjoint supports. The method employs a contrastive learning strategy to align generated in-distribution samples with real in-distribution samples, thereby allowing the OOD detector to learn effectively from generated OOD samples. Empirical studies demonstrate significant improvements in OOD detection performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a critical issue of mistaken OOD generation, providing a clear and promising solution.
- The introduction of two new losses in ATOL is well-justified and effectively presented.
- Comprehensive empirical studies validate the proposed method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The performance of the generator is a major concern, particularly regarding the concentration of in-distribution samples in high MoG density regions.
- The discussion on the limitations of generative model-based OOD detection and comparisons with other approaches is insufficient.
- The theoretical explanations, particularly regarding Condition 2, lack clarity, making it difficult to understand the implications for OOD data utilization.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the theoretical sections, particularly the proof of Condition 2, to enhance understanding of how it aids in utilizing OOD data. Additionally, we suggest including a comparative study with distance-based OOD detection methods, such as CIDER, to provide a broader context for their approach. The authors should also clarify the performance metrics of the generative models used and ensure that limitations are discussed in the main text. Lastly, addressing the writing quality and organization of mathematical notations would significantly enhance readability.
