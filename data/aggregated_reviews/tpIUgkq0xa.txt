Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method to enhance large language models (LLMs) by integrating Compiled Neural Networks (CoNNs) through a gating mechanism, aiming to improve performance on rule-intensive tasks such as symbolic and arithmetic reasoning. The authors propose a novel framework that allows for a plug-and-play approach, demonstrating that their integration achieves 100% accuracy on arithmetic tasks and outperforms fine-tuning methods in terms of performance and data efficiency across various symbolic reasoning tasks. The framework also shows that Neural Comprehension can achieve comparable performance to API-dependent methods while enabling better integration through gradient propagation, emphasizing the scientific value of using neural networks exclusively for symbolic tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively identifies the limitations of LLMs and proposes a unique solution that combines LLMs with CoNNs for improved symbolic and arithmetic operations.
- Achieving 100% accuracy in rule-based tasks without training is a significant advantage.
- Empirical results show strong performance against competitive baselines in arithmetic and symbolic reasoning tasks, supported by comprehensive experiments across various symbolic operation and reasoning tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the proposed method is questioned, as the integration of CoNNs with LLMs using a rule-based trigger does not seem sufficiently innovative for a NeurIPS paper.
- Presentation issues hinder clarity, including the placement of contributions in the appendix, insufficient explanation of CoNNs, and unclear gating mechanisms.
- The scalability of CoNN and the rule calculations of \(\beta\) require further clarification, as noted by multiple reviewers.
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion of the scalability of the approach and how it can be generalized to new tasks, along with a need for additional public benchmark testing to validate the approach's benefits across general-purpose datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by addressing the presentation issues, such as providing a more detailed introduction to CoNNs and ensuring that all key contributions are included in the main text rather than relegated to the appendix. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the gating mechanism and the implications of the beta factor, which is currently not implemented. To enhance the paper's impact, a discussion on the scalability of the approach and its applicability to new symbolic tasks should be included. Furthermore, we urge the authors to showcase the benefits of their approach using symbolic modules on public benchmarks with multiple language models to further validate the overall effectiveness of their framework. Finally, addressing grammatical errors and improving the overall readability will strengthen the manuscript.
