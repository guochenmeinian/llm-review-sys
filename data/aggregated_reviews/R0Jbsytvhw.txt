### Key Points
This paper presents a method that utilizes score matching alongside simulation-based training to infer the forces within a dynamical system. The authors provide experiments for both equilibrium systems and non-stationary processes, demonstrating their ability to recover non-conservative forces.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a significant real-world task.
2. It offers an intriguing exploration of score matching for learning dynamics from observed data without requiring trajectories.
3. The insights into the feasibility of inferring dynamics from cross-sectional data are valuable.
4. The dynamics inference problem is well-articulated and thoroughly motivated, with the introduction serving as an educational resource.
5. The novelty of inferring non-equilibrium dynamics is noteworthy.

Weaknesses:
1. The claim of novelty in force inference is undermined by the existence of "Two for One: Diffusion Models and Force Fields for Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics," which performs a similar task without being cited or discussed.
2. The density fitting approach for force field inference is seen as restrictive and potentially infeasible for large systems, requiring comprehensive data coverage at each timepoint. The computational expense of integrating the ODE for training and calculating divergence is not addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related work, particularly addressing the contributions of "Two for One: Diffusion Models and Force Fields for Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics." Additionally, it would be beneficial to provide a more thorough analysis of the limitations of the density fitting approach, including the computational challenges associated with training and divergence calculations.
