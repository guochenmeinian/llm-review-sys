### Key Points
This paper presents HyperLoRA, a task-agnostic adaptation method for large language models (LLMs) that addresses dialectal diversity by utilizing expert linguistic knowledge and hyper-networks for resource-efficient adaptation to unseen dialects. The authors demonstrate that HyperLoRA achieves competitive performance in a zero-shot setting across multiple dialects, leveraging hypernetworks to learn mappings from dialectal features to LoRA adapter weights without requiring human-annotated data. The evaluation on the GLUE benchmark shows its effectiveness and scalability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles the significant issue of dialectal diversity in LLMs, promoting inclusivity and fairness.
- HyperLoRA's innovative use of expert knowledge and hyper-networks demonstrates promising results in resource-efficient adaptation.
- Comprehensive evaluation on the GLUE benchmark, with solid comparisons to relevant baselines.
- Clear presentation of methodology and results, supported by well-structured figures.

Weaknesses:
- Lack of comprehensive comparisons with other dialect adaptation methods limits understanding of the state-of-the-art.
- The effectiveness of HyperLoRA on different model architectures is unexplored, and the absence of an ablation study restricts generalizability.
- Testing on synthetic data raises concerns about the validity of conclusions regarding real-world performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section by including information on hypernetworks and LoRA to enhance self-containment. Additionally, we suggest conducting a comprehensive comparison with other dialect adaptation methods to provide a clearer context for HyperLoRA's contributions. It would also be beneficial to explore the effectiveness of HyperLoRA on models with different architectures and to include an ablation study to evaluate the contribution of each component. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide more insights into the limitations of using synthetic data and to clarify how the feature representation for expert dialectal knowledge is encoded.
