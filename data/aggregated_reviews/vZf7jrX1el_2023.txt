Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
The authors present a comprehensive dataset of functional brain connectomes derived from functional MRI, comprising six subsets from various large open fMRI studies. This dataset has undergone state-of-the-art preprocessing and quality checks, resulting in functional connectivity matrices. An exemplary machine learning analysis demonstrates above-chance level predictions for different pathologies, highlighting the dataset's utility for the neuroscience community. The construction of contrast dense subgraphs is integral to the classification methodology, utilizing summary connectivity matrices from control and patient groups to extract features. While BOLD signals are included as node feature matrices for completeness, they were not utilized in the current experiments focused on assessing brain network construction quality. The authors have included a data loader in their codebase and are expanding their dataset to incorporate multimodal imaging data, specifically DTI. They clarify the performance of different parcellation methods and the clinical importance of their classification results, emphasizing the nascent nature of disease classification through brain networks. Additionally, comparisons with existing neuroimaging datasets are discussed, along with limitations and potential future work.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
- The methodology is sound, well-documented, and the paper is well-written, with a well-defined approach to constructing contrast dense subgraphs supported by relevant literature.
- Data and code are publicly accessible, versioned, and documented, addressing a significant gap in the field by providing a large, openly available brain network collection.
- The inclusion of domain experts in the design and quality assurance processes enhances the credibility of the pipeline.
- Classification experiments validate the dataset's utility for machine learning tasks.

**Weaknesses:**
- The necessity for improvement is minimal, but clarity regarding the domain expert group and their feedback process is lacking.
- The dataset size is still limited for effective training and evaluation of deeper GNN models.
- The classification analysis does not compare FC features with BOLD time series, which would enhance the assessment of data quality.
- There is a lack of detailed analysis on how parcellation affects model performance, and comparisons with existing datasets are insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
The authors should clarify the composition and feedback process of the domain expert group, providing examples of how their input influenced design choices. They should also improve the clarity of the role of BOLD signals in their methodology, particularly regarding their potential utility in future analyses. Additionally, the authors are encouraged to expand their dataset further to enhance its size and diversity, facilitating more robust training of GNN models. Conducting ablation studies to evaluate the impact of key design choices, particularly regarding parcellation methods and preprocessing techniques, would be beneficial. The authors should compare classification based on FC features with BOLD time series to better assess data quality and provide a more detailed comparison with other neuroimaging datasets to contextualize their contributions and highlight the advantages of their dataset. Finally, improving documentation and offering tutorials or walkthroughs on the dataset would enhance its accessibility and utility.
