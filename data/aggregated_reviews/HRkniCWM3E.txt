Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Pfaffian-based anti-symmetrization method for representing generalized wavefunctions in quantum chemistry, offering greater flexibility in orbital selection compared to traditional Slater determinants. The authors propose a new pretraining scheme that enhances the initial guess for Hartree-Fock solutions by addressing rotational symmetry. The effectiveness of their approach is validated through experiments on atomic systems and the TinyMol dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- This is the first study to utilize Pfaffians as an anti-symmetrization method in solving the Schrödinger equation with neural networks.
- The pretraining scheme effectively mitigates orbital disorder in Hartree-Fock solutions, leading to more accurate and stable initial wavefunction guesses.
- The method's performance remains robust against uncorrelated data, suggesting its potential for improved transferability with additional training data.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation on the TinyMol dataset complicates the attribution of performance differences solely to the new anti-symmetrization method, as the equivariant components differ from the baseline. An ablation study is recommended to clarify the proposed method's effectiveness.
- The introduction of a learnable padding vector for odd electron numbers raises concerns regarding its efficacy in out-of-distribution scenarios, particularly for unseen systems with different electron counts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the performance differences by conducting an ablation study to isolate the effects of the Pfaffian anti-symmetrization method. Additionally, the authors should address the concerns regarding the learnable padding vector's effectiveness in out-of-distribution scenarios. It would also be beneficial to include training-convergence plots with time rather than iterations when comparing Neural Pfaffian with baseline methods. Furthermore, we suggest providing a more intuitive metric for energy comparisons in the dataset and correcting identified typos throughout the paper. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore the application of NeurPf on metal atoms to assess its performance in those contexts.
