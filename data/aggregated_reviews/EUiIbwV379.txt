Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a differentially private feature selection algorithm, DPKendall, based on Kendall rank correlation, designed to enhance the performance of private linear regression without requiring users to set data bounds or hyperparameters. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of DPKendall through experiments on 25 regression datasets, showing its superiority over existing methods like SubLasso and its utility in high-dimensional settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The use of Kendall rank correlation as a scoring function is a smart choice, providing constant sensitivity and improving accuracy with more data samples.
2. The experimental execution is thorough, with results strongly supporting the algorithm's effectiveness in high-dimensional problems.
3. The paper is well-organized and easy to follow, providing both theoretical insights and empirical evidence for DPKendall.

Weaknesses:
1. The introduction of a new hyperparameter, the number of features \( k \), complicates the implementation. The authors should provide clearer guidance on how to choose \( k \) beyond suggesting 5 as a starting point.
2. The performance of the BAS method appears to be worse than reported in previous works, suggesting a need to verify the implementation against established benchmarks.
3. The integration of the feature selection step into the Tukey algorithm could enhance the overall approach, rather than treating it as a separate component.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity around the selection of the hyperparameter \( k \) for feature selection, potentially providing guidelines based on dataset characteristics. Additionally, we suggest verifying the implementation of the BAS method against the provided reference to ensure accuracy. Finally, consider integrating the feature selection process directly into the Tukey algorithm to streamline the approach and enhance its effectiveness.
