Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents VoxMol, a novel voxel-based method for generating 3D molecules represented as voxel grids using a neural empirical Bayes framework. The authors claim that this approach allows for efficient generation of valid 3D molecules without needing to specify the number of atoms in advance. The paper discusses the implications of using voxel representations and introduces a unique sampling method for denoising. The authors assert that VoxMol achieves competitive results against existing graph-based methods, particularly on the GEOM-Drugs benchmark. However, concerns are raised regarding the lack of clear advantages of the proposed method over traditional graph-based approaches and the necessity of incorporating chemical constraints to ensure the synthesizability of generated molecules. Additionally, the effectiveness of the proposed method without SE(3)-equivariance and the reliability of the "Validity" metric used for performance evaluation are questioned.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel method for 3D molecule generation that connects traditional molecular graph representation with voxel representation, potentially advancing drug discovery applications.
- VoxMol demonstrates competitive performance against existing models, particularly outperforming EDM on the GEOM-Drugs dataset.
- The writing is well-organized and easy to follow, making the methodology accessible.
- The evaluations provide insightful investigations into how noise levels affect the validity and uniqueness of generated molecules.
- The approach is efficient, requiring only one hyperparameter, the noise level $\sigma$.

Weaknesses:
- The advantages of voxel grids over 3D molecular graphs are not convincingly established, as existing graph-based methods can also sample atom numbers and handle discrete and continuous distributions.
- The claimed advantages of VoxMol over graph-based methods are not sufficiently articulated, leading to concerns about its unique contributions.
- The model lacks a clear mechanism for ensuring SE(3)-equivariance, which is critical for accurately representing molecular structures.
- The "Validity" metric may not adequately assess the quality of generated 3D structures, particularly regarding fragment-level chemical constraints.
- The experimental results do not demonstrate a clear advantage of VoxMol over strong baseline methods, particularly in terms of relevant metrics.
- Concerns regarding data efficiency and the importance of respecting chemical constraints in real-world applications remain inadequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation metrics by incorporating those from the MiDi paper, as they provide a more representative assessment of performance. Additionally, the authors should discuss the implications of using a fixed grid size for their generative model, as this restricts the output space. It is essential to address the weaknesses of the one-step denoising procedure, particularly regarding the inability to control generation through auxiliary gradient signals. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors explore methods to enforce SE(3)-equivariance in their model to enhance its robustness and applicability in molecular generation. We also recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the unique advantages of VoxMol compared to existing graph-based methods, particularly from the perspectives of data representation and model design. It is crucial to address how image-based representations can enhance the quality of generated molecules, especially in terms of respecting chemical constraints. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide quantitative evidence of the SE(3)-equivariance properties of their model to strengthen their claims regarding its performance and to thoroughly address the practical challenges of data collection for 3D molecule structures.
