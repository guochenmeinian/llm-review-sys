Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an efficient framework for learning macroscopic dynamics from partially observed microscopic dynamics, utilizing an autoencoder to define the latent space. The authors propose a method that approximates a vector field \( g \) on macroscopic variables, where some variables are given and others are outputs from a trained encoder network. The core idea is that macroscopic variables can be estimated from a small subset of microscopic variables, allowing for a coarse-graining approach in molecular dynamics (MD). The authors demonstrate data efficiency through various experiments on different dynamical systems, showing that macroscopic dynamics can be computed by training on a small subset of microscopic forces without requiring full microscopic simulations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
* The approach is novel and addresses a significant bottleneck in the field, potentially contributing to machine learning applications in dynamical systems.  
* The method's appeal lies in its ability to approximate macroscopic states without requiring microscopic simulations, making it potentially useful for MD applications.  
* The exposition is generally clear and well-structured, making the content accessible.  
* The authors have acknowledged the need to clarify terminology and descriptions, which could enhance understanding.  
* The experiments encompass a range of dynamical systems, including molecular dynamics (MD) and partial differential equation (PDE) systems.  

Weaknesses:  
* There is skepticism regarding the efficacy of \( L_x \) as a proxy for \( L_z \). Empirical analysis on the Jacobian spectrum \( \psi' \) or loss curves comparing \( L_z \) and \( L_x \) would enhance understanding.  
* The significance of final test errors is unclear without scaling plots for all analyzed systems, as shown in Figure 2.  
* The manuscript suffers from unclear terminology, particularly regarding the use of "force" instead of "vector field," which has led to confusion about the method's appeal.  
* The depiction in Figure 1 misrepresents the method's requirements, suggesting that all forces must be computed when they are not necessary for training the macroscopic vector field.  
* Table 1 and Figure 2 are redundant; eliminating Table 1 is recommended.  
* Theorem 2 lacks clarity regarding \( \arg \min L_{x,p} \), as \( L_{x,p} \) is a random variable.  
* The tuning of the conditioning number loss term requires further exploration, including ablation analyses to assess its impact.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical analysis on the spectrum of the Jacobian \( \psi' \) and provide loss curves for \( L_z \) versus \( L_x \) during training. Additionally, scaling plots for all systems analyzed should be included to clarify the significance of test errors. We suggest improving the clarity of terminology throughout the paper, specifically by referring to \( f \) as a vector field rather than a force and providing a clear explanation for this choice after Equation 1. Furthermore, we advise the authors to revise Figure 1 by removing the misleading black arrows and retaining only the relevant pink arrows to better illustrate the method's operation. Consider removing Table 1 to reduce redundancy with Figure 2. The authors should clarify Theorem 2, particularly the definition of \( \arg \min L_{x,p} \). Lastly, an ablation study on the conditioning number loss term would provide valuable insights into its tuning and impact on results, and we encourage the authors to elaborate on the relationship between error reduction through averaging and the small condition number of \( \phi'(x)\phi'(x)^T \).
