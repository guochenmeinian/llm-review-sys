Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Collaborative Lifelong Adaptation (CoLA) method for test-time adaptation (TTA) across multiple devices. The core idea is to accumulate and share knowledge learned during adaptation, enhancing efficiency and effectiveness in adapting to distribution shifts. The authors categorize devices into principal and follower agents based on computational resources and demonstrate CoLA's performance in various scenarios, showing its adaptability and anti-forgetting capabilities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors propose a new setting of cross-device collaborative TTA.
2. The method is technically sound and well-organized, making it easy to understand.
3. Extensive experiments with transformer-based models are conducted across various scenarios.

Weaknesses:
1. Limited comparisons with test-time federated learning; the relationship should be thoroughly discussed with comparative results.
2. Insufficient scalability analysis regarding the growth of the shared domain vector set T.
3. Vague explanation of lifelong adaptation performance and potential memory issues from accumulating domain vectors.
4. Incomplete experimental details, including the rationale for selected methods and baseline criteria.
5. Lack of statistical significance in results, as error bars are not reported.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the relationship between collaborative TTA and federated learning, including comparative experimental results. Additionally, a thorough scalability analysis should be conducted to address how the method performs with an increasing number of devices and domains. The authors should clarify the approach to lifelong adaptation and provide detailed explanations of experimental settings, including the selection of methods and baselines. Lastly, including error bars in the results would enhance the statistical significance of the findings.
