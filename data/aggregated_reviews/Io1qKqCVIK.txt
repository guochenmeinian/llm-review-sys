Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel differentiable mesh representation, DMesh, which utilizes a weighted Delaunay triangulation (WDT) framework to predict simplex probabilities. The authors decompose the probability of face existence into two components: the WDT probability and the probability of vertices' existence on the surface. The method is designed to be computationally efficient, running in approximately linear time, and is applicable for reconstructing surfaces from point clouds and multi-view images. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of DMesh through extensive evaluations against state-of-the-art methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The probabilistic approach for determining face existence is innovative and supports gradient-based optimization for vertex positions and connectivity.
- The efficient CUDA implementation and relaxation design enhance usability.
- Extensive validation and quantitative comparisons with other methods are well-presented, showcasing the method's effectiveness in various applications.

Weaknesses:
- The computational cost remains significant, particularly with large datasets, limiting application to small object tasks.
- The method does not guarantee manifoldness of the resulting mesh, and the lack of testing on real-world or texture-rich datasets diminishes its applicability.
- There is insufficient discussion on the influence of parameters \(\lambda_{WDT}\) and \(\lambda_{real}\), and the paper lacks examples of non-manifold meshes and their occurrence.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the computational cost by providing detailed statistics over various mesh and point cloud sizes. Additionally, we suggest including experiments that demonstrate the influence of \(\lambda_{WDT}\) and \(\lambda_{real}\) to strengthen the core contributions. It would also be beneficial to showcase the deformation process of a mesh with different topologies and to provide examples of non-manifold meshes, including an estimation of their occurrence. Finally, addressing the potential for interpolations between DMeshes with topology changes would enhance the paper's contributions.
