### Key Points
This paper presents an empirical study of zero-shot named entity recognition (NER) using the large language model ChatGPT. The authors propose four strategies tailored for NER: task decomposition by entity labels, syntactic augmentation, self-consistency, and two-stage majority voting. The experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in zero-shot NER performance across English and Chinese datasets, providing valuable insights for low-resource NER scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is clear, easy to understand, and includes thorough experiments on both English and Chinese datasets.
- The proposed strategies significantly enhance NER performance and provide insights into optimization directions.
- The incorporation of reasoning techniques for multi-step inference is a novel contribution.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the augmentation strategies is limited, as they are basic and commonly used in NLP tasks.
- The experiments lack comparisons with standard chain-of-thought (CoT) methods and do not evaluate on widely-used NER datasets like CoNLL-2003 and WNUT-17.
- Efficiency concerns arise from the decomposed question-answering paradigm, which requires multiple inquiries to ChatGPT.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their augmentation strategies by including experiments on standard CoT techniques and evaluating their methods on additional widely-used NER datasets like CoNLL-2003 and WNUT-17. Additionally, addressing the efficiency concerns related to the decomposed question-answering paradigm would enhance the practical applicability of their approach. Finally, we suggest that the authors elaborate on their next steps to address identified limitations and refine their reasoning techniques.
