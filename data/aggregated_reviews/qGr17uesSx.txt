### Key Points
This paper presents a joint learning framework that combines keyphrase extraction and generation using contrastive learning to build context-aware phrase-level representations. The authors propose a reranker based on semantic alignment to enhance absent keyphrase prediction performance. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmark datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The combination of extraction and generation methods is reasonably novel and technically sound.
- The reranking strategy after over-generation effectively improves absent keyphrase generation.
- The paper is well-written and includes appropriate ablation studies to support its claims.

Weaknesses:
- The innovation of the joint learning framework is limited, as existing methods like UniKeyphrase also address this.
- The motivation for the benefits of the contrastive learning framework is weak and lacks sufficient detail.
- The computational expense of the new framework is a concern, and comparisons with standard models may not be entirely fair.
- The lack of released code and data raises reproducibility issues.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for the contrastive learning framework by providing more detailed explanations of its benefits for learning phrase-level representations. Additionally, we suggest that the authors address the implementation of stronger sequence labeling baselines to substantiate their claims regarding the superiority of contrastive learning. It would also be beneficial to use the best results of UniKeyphrase (beam=4) for comparison in Table 3. Finally, we urge the authors to consider releasing their code and data to enhance reproducibility and facilitate ongoing research efforts.
