Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a precise asymptotic characterization of the naive mean field approximation (NMF) in high-dimensional linear regression under specific priors. The authors derive two significant corollaries: the inaccuracy of the NMF approximation for the log-normalizing constant and its overconfidence in uncertainty quantification. The work contributes to understanding the limitations of NMF in high-dimensional settings, providing theoretical evidence for its sub-optimality and implications for uncertainty quantification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an important research question, contributing valuable insights into the utility of NMF in modern machine learning.
- It is mathematically solid, with novel proof techniques in variational inference and a clear presentation of theoretical results.
- The approach is innovative, filling gaps in existing literature and providing a rigorous examination of the NMF's limitations.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation is often unclear, with undefined notations and a lack of formalized conditions that hinder comprehension. Specific technical details, such as the definition of the NMF objective and the main theorem, are obscured by excessive technicality.
- The practical utility of the findings is not immediately evident, and the writing requires significant proofreading to address numerous minor typos and stylistic issues.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by setting up a table or subsection for all notations and formalizing the conditions used throughout the paper. Additionally, we suggest that the authors elaborate on the intuition behind the NMF approximation's limitations in high-dimensional settings, potentially moving the proof sketch to the appendix to allow more space for this discussion. Lastly, addressing the minor typos and ensuring consistent notation will enhance the overall readability of the paper.
