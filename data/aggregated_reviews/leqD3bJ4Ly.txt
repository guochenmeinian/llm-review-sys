Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents OPEL, a novel framework for procedure learning from videos that utilizes optimal transport (OT) to align key steps across different video instances. OPEL formulates the distance calculation between video frames as an OT problem, allowing for flexible alignment beyond frame-to-frame mappings. The authors enhance the OT formulation with two regularization terms to improve alignment and learning, achieving significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper proposes a novel optimal transport-based procedure learning framework that aligns frames with similar semantics in an embedding space.
2. It effectively addresses variations in real-world sequences, including background and non-monotonic frames.
3. OPEL demonstrates superior performance across several benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Weaknesses:
1. The authors should compare OPEL with recent action segmentation methods to strengthen the experimental validation.
2. The presentation needs improvement, particularly in Section 3, where excessive formulas hinder readability.
3. The explanation of the regularization terms and their impact on video variations is unclear, and the statistical significance of some results is not well established.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the problem formulation, including the input and output specifications. Specifically, they should clarify whether the output video contains a fixed number of K key steps and how to handle cases where the number of steps exceeds or falls short of K. Additionally, we suggest providing more results from ablation studies on K for additional tasks and enhancing the presentation of formulas and figures for better readability.
