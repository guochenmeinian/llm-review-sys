Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection that integrates Lens Depth (LD) and Fermat distance, aiming to assess whether a sample's representation in a Neural Network's penultimate layer resembles that of training data. The method is evaluated against various OoD detection benchmarks, demonstrating competitive performance without disrupting the training process. Unlike traditional methods that assume Gaussian distributions, this approach estimates similarity without such assumptions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of mathematical concepts like Fermat Distance and Lens Depth is innovative and not commonly known in the Machine Learning community.
- The literature is well-cited, and the mathematical concepts are presented clearly and intuitively.
- The claims are substantiated by evidence, and the evaluation aligns with standard practices in OoD detection.
- The paper is well-structured and articulates a coherent argument.
- The method is minimally invasive, which is advantageous for scenarios involving large pre-trained models.

Weaknesses:
- Some claims, such as "no assumptions" regarding distribution forms, are misleading; only minimal assumptions exist.
- The measure of "uncertainty estimation" is evaluated solely for OoD detection, raising concerns about its performance on aleatoric uncertainty.
- The applicability of the method to all classification models is overstated, as it is only tested on Neural Networks.
- The explanation of Lens Depth could benefit from visual aids for better comprehension.
- The results do not significantly outperform existing methods, and the necessity of a minimally invasive approach is not convincingly argued.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of claims regarding assumptions about distribution forms and provide evidence for the method's applicability across various classification models. Additionally, we suggest including a visual representation of Lens Depth to enhance understanding. The authors should also consider conducting evaluations on larger datasets, such as ImageNet, and include additional metrics like FPR-95 and ECE to strengthen the evaluation protocol. Furthermore, a more detailed discussion on the implications of clustering methods used in the approach would be beneficial. Lastly, clarifying the computational cost of the proposed method post-optimizations discussed in Section 4.5 would add value.
