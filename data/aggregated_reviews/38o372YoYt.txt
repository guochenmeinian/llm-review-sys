Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive study on in-context learning of compositionality in images, introducing a benchmark for compositional language-driven visual transformations and examining conditions under which models can perform in-context analogies from image pairs. The authors propose a framework called Im-Promptu, which formalizes the notion of an analogy-based in-context learner and evaluates it through three benchmarks assessing the generalization capacities of visual in-context learners.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study addresses an important topic, providing relevant conclusions that can lead to hypotheses for real-world applications of in-context analogical reasoning.
- The paper is novel, formulating the concept of analogy-based in-context learners and offering a detailed analysis of compositionality's influence on generalization.
- The introduction of three benchmarks for evaluating visual in-context learners is a significant contribution.

Weaknesses:
- Concerns exist regarding the transferability of results from synthetic data to real-world scenarios, although the diversity of synthetic sources partially mitigates this issue.
- The paper's technical novelty is questioned, particularly regarding the distinction between Im-Promptu and existing visual analogy-making methods.
- The presentation is criticized for being unclear, with long sentences and missing technical details, making it difficult to follow.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions by explicitly distinguishing Im-Promptu from existing methods like SLATE and visual analogy-making. Additionally, consider including experiments on natural images to enhance the generalizability of the findings. We also suggest revising the writing for conciseness and clarity, potentially moving technical details to an appendix to streamline the main text. Lastly, addressing the limitations of the proposed method more thoroughly would strengthen the paper.
