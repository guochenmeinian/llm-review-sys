### Key Points
This paper presents 'indicator tasks' as an alternative to traditional probing tasks for evaluating embedding spaces. The authors argue that while indicator tasks may require more effort to create, they more effectively capture biases in embedding spaces, especially after linear transformations. The paper includes case studies that illustrate the contrasting outcomes between linear probes and indicator tasks, advocating for the latter in understanding linguistic properties.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The evaluation of embeddings, particularly regarding bias, is relevant to the NLP community.  
- The second use case investigating morphological information in word embeddings is valuable for the EMNLP audience.  
- The introduction of a compelling topic and the clever use of concept erasure to compare analytical methods are notable contributions.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks clarity in certain sections, making it difficult to follow the methodology and results.  
- Overclaiming or insufficient experimentation is evident, as the case studies primarily compare simple linear classifiers with indicator tasks without addressing more complex probing methods.  
- The paper does not sufficiently relate the results of the analysis methods to the model's practical outputs, leaving questions about their significance unanswered.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity throughout the paper, particularly in explaining why tasks are termed 'indicator tasks' and unpacking complex statements. Additionally, we suggest integrating Section 4 into Section 5 for coherence and providing visual illustrations of errors to enhance the analysis of biases. It would also be beneficial to include qualitative analyses for both case studies to clarify the performance differences between probes and indicators. Finally, we encourage the authors to discuss the relationship between probing and indicator tasks more thoroughly, considering whether one approach should take precedence over the other.
