Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical framework for incentive-aware delegation of machine learning tasks, focusing on a principal-agent game where the principal allocates a budget to incentivize an agent to train a classifier. The authors analyze optimal contract design, revealing that under certain assumptions, the optimal contract can take a simple threshold form. They connect this to the Neyman-Pearson lemma and provide empirical results on how model parameters influence contract design and classifier performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel and well-motivated problem relevant to the NeurIPS community, particularly in contract theory.
- The analysis is rigorous, with clear technical contributions, including the connection to hypothesis testing and a helpful taxonomy in Table 1.
- The empirical evaluation supports the theoretical findings, and the writing is clear and accessible.

Weaknesses:
- The assumption that the principal has access to a learning curve may limit the model's applicability. While the authors address this, further exploration could enhance the discussion.
- Some results may be derived from existing literature on contract theory, raising questions about the novelty of the approach.
- The model's scalability is a concern, as the LP solver's practical limits are not clearly justified.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity in Section 2 by specifying that $h_{n}$ is a stochastic quantity dependent on a distribution related to $n$. Additionally, clarifications in the second plot of Figure 3 would enhance comprehension. Emphasizing that the contract $t$ varies with validation accuracy could prevent potential misunderstandings. The authors should also clarify the term "robustness" in Line 372 and correct minor writing issues, such as in Line 120 ("the principal cannot now" should be "the principal cannot know"). Addressing the generalizability of results and discussing the implications of risk-averse agents would strengthen the paper. Lastly, comparisons between various contract structures in the empirical section would provide valuable insights.
