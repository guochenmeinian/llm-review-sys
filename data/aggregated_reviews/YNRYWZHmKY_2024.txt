Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of the bias problem in text-to-image generation, focusing on text embeddings rather than the attention map processing of previous works. The authors propose the Text Embedding Balance Optimization (TEBOpt) method, which aims to enhance the alignment of text-to-image generation by optimizing text embeddings. The paper includes extensive experiments, revealing that the proposed method improves information balance and reduces bias towards the first-mentioned object in prompts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors conduct numerous interesting experiments to analyze the alignment problem, including masking special tokens.
2. The exploration of text embeddings rather than the UNet network is commendable.
3. The paper is well-organized, clearly written, and provides code to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
4. The originality of the TEBOpt method offers a new perspective on T2I models, addressing previously overlooked causal mechanisms.

Weaknesses:
1. The presented problem appears to be based on an older version of Stable Diffusion, and testing on the latest version (SD3) reveals no such issues.
2. The analysis of text embeddings lacks consideration of the End-of-Text (EOT) token, which plays a key role.
3. The visual results are of poor quality, raising questions about potential negative influences of the proposed method.
4. The baselines used are outdated; more recent methods like SDXL, SD3, PlayG-v2, Ranni, and Ella should be considered.
5. The authors should utilize public benchmarks, such as T2I-CompBench, for comparison.
6. The proposed idea may not be sufficient for a conference like NeurIPS, indicating a need for more substantial contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis by testing the proposed method on the latest version of Stable Diffusion (SD3) to validate their findings. Additionally, the authors should consider the role of the EOT token in their analysis of text embeddings. To enhance the visual quality of generated images, we suggest investigating potential negative influences of the proposed method. The authors should also update their baselines to include more recent methods and utilize public benchmarks like T2I-CompBench for a more robust evaluation. Finally, we encourage the authors to expand their exploration beyond simple scenarios to include more complex prompts and diverse object classes, thereby strengthening the generality of their findings.
