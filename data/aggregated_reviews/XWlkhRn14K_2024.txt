Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a unified modeling approach named Hermes for aligning human and AI performance in chess. Hermes incorporates a skill-aware attention mechanism that adapts to varying player skill levels, enhancing AI-guided teaching tools and providing insights into human decision-making. The authors emphasize that coherence is the central motivation of their work, not merely an observed outcome. They argue that Hermes outperforms previous models, such as Maia, by employing a unified, parameter-sharing approach that regularizes predictions across skill levels. The model demonstrates improvements in move prediction accuracy and coherence compared to existing models, effectively capturing human chess styles across different skill levels. The skill-aware attention module further enhances coherence by learning consistent representations of positions while accommodating skill-level interactions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear descriptions and sufficient details for reproduction.  
2. The method is simple yet effective, showing notable results across various settings.  
3. Hermes provides a coherent framework for modeling human behavior in chess, significantly improving prediction coherence across skill levels.  
4. The unified, parameter-sharing approach is a strong foundation for achieving coherence across skill levels.  
5. The skill-aware attention mechanism effectively captures nuanced interactions between positions and skill levels, contributing to coherent predictions.

Weaknesses:  
1. The method relies primarily on the multi-head attention mechanism, which is a general technique and may lack novelty.  
2. The motivation for using attention and its effectiveness is not clearly articulated.  
3. The definition of skill within the model is vague, potentially limiting its applicability beyond chess.  
4. The performance improvement over baselines is minimal, and the lack of statistical testing raises questions about significance.  
5. The paper does not adequately address biases from data sourced from a specific online platform, affecting generalizability.  
6. The intuition behind coherence, while sensible, may not be robust enough without additional empirical evidence, such as model size and training set details.  
7. The claim regarding the similarity of predictions for adjacent skill levels requires theoretical backing to substantiate its validity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind the skill-aware attention mechanism and provide a more robust definition of skill to enhance applicability. Additionally, including statistical testing to validate performance improvements and addressing potential biases in the data would strengthen the paper. We suggest exploring the significance of the architectural choices made in Hermes compared to simpler models and providing qualitative analyses of the model's performance across different skill levels. Furthermore, we recommend improving the clarity of the central motivation regarding coherence in the Abstract, Introduction, and Discussion sections. Providing more empirical evidence, such as model size and training set specifics, would strengthen the argument that parameter sharing is crucial for coherence. The authors should also consider including theoretical evidence to support the claim that P(y|position, skill level_{i}) \approx P(y|position, skill level_{i+1}). Lastly, clarifying that the design encourages coherence without enforcing it as a hard constraint would enhance the understanding of Hermes's architecture, and correcting minor errors in figures while ensuring all relevant literature on modeling diverse agents is cited would improve the manuscript's quality.
