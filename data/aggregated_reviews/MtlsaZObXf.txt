Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a focus on the interpretability of neural PDE solvers through the integration of symbolic frameworks, such as symbolic regression. However, the authors do not clearly articulate the specific contributions, integration methods, or results of their work.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper may contribute positively to the workshop by highlighting the importance of incorporating symbolic frameworks in PDE solvers.

Weaknesses:  
The contribution of the work is unclear, lacking detailed explanations on integration methods and results. The discussion is limited, with only 1.5 pages dedicated to content beyond the introduction and existing methods. Additionally, there are typos present in the fourth line of section 2 and in reference [1].

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding the specific contributions of their work, including detailed explanations on how to integrate symbolic frameworks into neural PDE solvers and the results obtained. Furthermore, addressing the limitations in the discussion length and correcting typos would enhance the overall quality of the paper. Additionally, the authors should consider reviewing the recent survey paper on AI for PDE methods to identify any relevant connections.
