Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel training framework aimed at unifying image and text recognition within a single model, incorporating both visual and language decoders. The framework employs a two-stage training process, utilizing intra-scale data for pre-training and inter-scale samples for fine-tuning. Experimental results indicate the framework's effectiveness, particularly in document-related tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors aim to unify image and text recognition tasks in one module, benefiting the community.
2. The general pipeline of the paper is clear.
3. The performance improvements in the experiments appear significant.

Weaknesses:
1. The claim of unifying image and text recognition is undermined by the presence of two separate decoders, suggesting a less elegant integration.
2. While the pipeline is clear, details regarding data preparation for intra-scale and inter-scale training are lacking, particularly the rationale behind random feature sampling and its potential to discard important tokens.
3. The assertion of scale robustness as a key contribution is not sufficiently supported by experiments, as input scales are fixed.
4. The test stage's design raises questions about task specification for images used for both recognition types, limiting flexibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of data preparation processes for both intra-scale and inter-scale training. Additionally, the authors should provide more comprehensive experiments demonstrating scale robustness with flexible input sizes. It would be beneficial to clarify the test stage's functionality, particularly how to handle images requiring both recognition types. Lastly, addressing the concerns regarding the random feature sampling's applicability to document images would enhance the paper's rigor.
