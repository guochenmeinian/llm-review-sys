### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into how stereotypes are encoded in pre-trained language models, utilizing model probing and textual analysis. The authors connect model components that detect stereotypes to those that encode biases, identifying which attention heads significantly impact stereotype detection. They introduce a new benchmark dataset, "ImplicitStereo," which addresses challenges in stereotype evaluation. The findings indicate that pruning 15%-30% of the most influential attention heads can nearly eliminate model bias. Additionally, the study reveals that different models exhibit varying stereotypes towards minority groups, highlighting the model-specific nature of the de-biasing process.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers innovative insights into the relationship between model components and stereotype detection.
- The introduction of the ImplicitStereo dataset is a significant contribution that enhances future research.
- The experiments are well-designed, and the results are clearly presented and convincing.

Weaknesses:
- The justification for the conclusion that attention heads contributing to stereotype detection also encode stereotypes needs strengthening.
- The paper lacks a detailed comparison with existing de-biasing techniques, which is crucial for evaluating the proposed method's effectiveness.
- The creation of the ImplicitStereo dataset lacks sufficient detail, and the reliance on LLM-generated stereotypes raises concerns about real-world grounding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for their conclusion regarding the relationship between attention heads and stereotype encoding, particularly in light of the observations made in Figure 4. Additionally, we suggest including a comparison of the proposed attention-head-ablation technique with existing de-biasing methods in terms of bias score reduction. It would also be beneficial to provide more comprehensive details about the ImplicitStereo dataset creation process, including prompt construction and validation methods. Engaging with affected communities to inform the dataset would enhance its relevance and grounding in real-world issues. Finally, addressing the reproducibility concerns related to the dataset would strengthen the overall contribution of the work.
