Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of the sparse Variational Gaussian Process framework (SVGP) tailored for Bayesian optimization (BO) tasks. The authors introduce a new optimization criterion, the expected utility lower bound (EULBO), which optimizes SVGP parameters to enhance training data fitting and improve new solution candidate selection. Two instantiations of EULBO, utilizing Expected Improvement (EI) and Knowledge Gradient (KG), are derived, and extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate the proposed approach's effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is clearly written and straightforward to follow despite its density.
- The proposed approach is technically solid and mathematically sound.
- It addresses a relevant problem with an elegant solution.
- Methodology and experiments are well-presented, showcasing significant improvements in sample efficiency over baselines.

Weaknesses:
- Certain details regarding Figure 1 are unclear, such as the choice of inducing points and the constant uncertainty observed.
- Missing notation in equations, such as the absence of $t$ in Eq. 2 and the dependence of the sum on $j$ in the equation after line 221.
- The paper lacks clarity on the performance of baselines and the variance of EULBO across different objectives.
- Many derivations are abbreviated, and some notation is inadequately explained, complicating readability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by providing additional details regarding Figure 1, including the exact problem definition and parameterizations for reproducibility. The authors should also ensure all necessary notation is defined, particularly in Section 2, and clarify the emergence of terms in equations, such as the normalizing constant Z in Eq. 6. Furthermore, we suggest discussing the unexpected performance of the exact GP in comparison to the proposed method and providing guidance on the trade-offs between different variants of EULBO. Lastly, quantifying the increased computational complexity of EULBO through empirical runtimes would enhance the paper's practical value.
