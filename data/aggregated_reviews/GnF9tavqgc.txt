Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method to enhance molecular structure and energy prediction by leveraging scientific laws that connect these tasks. The authors propose two forms of consistency losses based on the principles that equilibrium structures minimize energy and the relationship between the probability distributions of structure and energy. The effectiveness of these consistency losses is demonstrated through experiments on quantum chemistry datasets, showing improvements in multi-task learning frameworks. Additionally, the authors respond to reviewer feedback by addressing concerns about data abundance and the applicability of their approach, proposing additional experimental results to clarify the treatment of structurally dissimilar molecules between PM6 and the training sets of PCQ (or QM9). They express eagerness for further discussion and highlight the importance of obtaining a code link approval from the Area Chair.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Developing consistency loss functions is an elegant approach to integrating scientific laws into machine learning.
- The proposed method enhances prediction performance without requiring additional data.
- The authors have effectively addressed most reviewer concerns and provided valuable insights in their rebuttal.
- They have clarified the applicability of their approach and offered additional experimental results to support their claims.

Weaknesses:
- The demonstration is limited to the specific case of energy and equilibrium structure, raising questions about broader applicability.
- The review of related works is not comprehensive, omitting discussions of similar approaches like PINNs.
- The title and abstract are too general, failing to reflect the specific tasks addressed.
- The selection criteria for the 200 test molecules are unclear, and the paper does not address the removal of structurally similar molecules.
- There remains uncertainty regarding the treatment of structurally dissimilar molecules, which could impact the overall validity of the findings.
- The authors have not yet received a response from reviewer B2Rx, which may hinder further discussion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the title and abstract to better reflect the specific contributions of the paper. Additionally, we suggest discussing related works such as PINNs to provide a more comprehensive context. Clarifying the criteria for selecting the 200 test molecules and addressing the removal of structurally similar molecules would strengthen the experimental design. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to comment on the efficiency of the proposed method, particularly regarding the computational costs associated with consistency loss and model convergence. We also recommend improving clarity regarding the treatment of structurally dissimilar molecules to strengthen their argument. Lastly, we suggest that the authors follow up with the Area Chair to expedite the approval of the code link, as this is crucial for reviewer engagement and potential score adjustments.
