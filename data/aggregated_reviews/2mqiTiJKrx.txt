### Key Points
This paper presents a study of the pure exploration transductive linear bandit problem within the context of instrumental variables. The authors propose a method that estimates parameters in a linear structural equation model while optimally designing to identify the best treatment arm. The paper is primarily theoretical, supplemented by simulations, and introduces the confounded pure exploration transductive linear bandit (CPET-LB) problem, addressing adaptive experimentation challenges in non-randomized environments. The authors provide algorithms with nearly optimal sample complexity guarantees.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The integration of instrumental variables with pure exploration is a novel approach.  
2. The theoretical analysis is thorough, including finite-time confidence intervals and sample complexity bounds, which are significant contributions.  
3. The proposed algorithm demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional A/B testing and standard linear bandit methods.  
4. The practical relevance of the scenarios examined is well-motivated, indicating potential industry impact.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The presentation, particularly in Section 1 and Section 3, is dense and could benefit from clearer organization and editing.  
2. There is a lack of real-data demonstration and limited experimental evaluation of the proposed methods across diverse settings.  
3. The connections to existing literature are not clearly articulated, and the terminology used may confuse readers.  
4. The title may be misleading and could be reconsidered for clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and organization of the presentation, particularly in Sections 1 and 3, to enhance readability. Additionally, conducting more extensive experiments to validate the robustness of the results would strengthen the paper. A more detailed discussion of p-values and confidence intervals is necessary to bolster the statistical analysis. Finally, we suggest reconsidering the title to better reflect the content and avoid potential confusion.
