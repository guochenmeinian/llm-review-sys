Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on causal representation learning (CRL) in both linear settings and under the assumption of single-node interventions, focusing on the concept of surrounded-node ambiguity (SNA) and proposing the LiNGCReL algorithm. The authors demonstrate that identification is possible under reasonable conditions with data from diverse environments, highlighting the limitations of previous methods that depend on single-node interventions. They argue that the assumption of shared causal graphs and mixing functions across different environments is reasonable, particularly when data is available from multiple domains, such as the iWildCam dataset. The authors acknowledge the current limitations of their work while demonstrating the best-achievable identification guarantees in a multi-environment setup.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of SNA and identifiability up to SNA is novel and significant for understanding ambiguities in CRL.
- The proposed LiNGCReL algorithm is practical and provably identifies causal structures up to SNA, offering a more flexible approach compared to existing methods.
- The paper provides a clear framework for understanding causal representation learning with single-node interventions and references relevant literature, establishing a solid foundation for its claims.
- The authors acknowledge limitations and outline future directions for research.

Weaknesses:
- The assumptions made in the paper do not appear to be weaker than those in existing literature.
- The problem setting is perceived as somewhat limited, particularly as the paper is confined to linear causal models and does not explore nonlinear extensions or real-world applications, relying solely on synthetic data for validation.
- Clarity and accuracy in contrast to referenced works need significant improvement, with some claims being unclear or incorrect.
- The presentation is vague in several areas, and some mathematical notations are not clearly defined.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definitions and concepts, particularly "general environments," and provide explicit explanations for the assumptions made in the paper regarding shared causal graphs and mixing functions. Additionally, we suggest revising vague statements and ensuring that all mathematical notations are clearly defined. The authors should consider including experiments on real-world data or semi-synthetic datasets to validate the effectiveness of LiNGCReL against classical methods. Furthermore, a thorough analysis of the computational complexity of LiNGCReL would enhance the paper's rigor.
