### Key Points
This paper presents an evaluation of GDPR compliance through the lens of the Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF), analyzing 2,230 websites to assess their adherence to user consent choices. The authors conclude that while most websites record consent correctly, a significant 72.8% utilize the "legitimate interest" claim to override user consent, raising concerns about the TCF's effectiveness in safeguarding user privacy. The study is notable for being one of the first to explore TCF compliance post-versions 2.0 and 2.1, providing insights relevant to regulators and market participants.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The study examines a large sample of websites, providing a thorough analysis of TCF compliance.  
- It addresses a critical issue in digital privacy, highlighting the implications of "legitimate interest" for user consent.  
- The methodology is robust, and the findings are presented clearly, making complex information accessible.  

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty of the work is questioned, as it largely confirms previous findings regarding the misuse of "legitimate interest."  
- The legal discussions are at times unclear, particularly in distinguishing between TCF guidelines and GDPR requirements.  
- The focus on European websites may limit the applicability of findings to other jurisdictions.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the legal discussions by explicitly distinguishing between GDPR mandates and TCF interpretations. Additionally, the authors should explore the nuances of "legitimate interest" more deeply, including how it is interpreted and applied by websites. We suggest that the authors utilize the data from their crawler more effectively, particularly by analyzing the parameters sent to third parties to enhance the depth of their findings. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the scope of their study in relation to previous research and to address the potential limitations of focusing solely on European websites.
