### Key Points
This paper presents a data-centric framework, D2K (Data-to-Knowledge), aimed at integrating old knowledge with new data in recommendation systems. It models old data as a knowledge base, utilizing a Transformer-based knowledge encoder to convert historical user behavior data into retrievable ternary knowledge, which includes user, item, and context. The authors propose a personalized knowledge adaptation unit to tailor this knowledge for specific recommendations. The framework demonstrates significant improvements in metrics such as AUC and log loss, indicating its potential for real-world applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces an innovative and well-grounded approach to knowledge integration.
- It is well-written and easy to follow, with comprehensive experiments validating the framework's effectiveness across multiple datasets.
- The modular design allows for flexibility and adaptability in various recommendation models.

Weaknesses:
- The architecture appears complex, and the model framework diagram lacks detail, particularly in the Knowledge Injection section.
- Limited dataset diversity raises concerns about the framework's generalizability to other domains.
- The paper lacks quantitative benchmarks for storage efficiency, retrieval latency, and computational overhead, which are critical for evaluating practical applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the model framework diagram by adding more layers of detail, especially regarding the integration of knowledge vectors with the recommendation model. Additionally, we suggest including a broader range of backbone models in the experiments for a more comprehensive analysis. To address concerns about scalability, we encourage the authors to analyze the complexity of the proposed approach in the main content. Finally, we recommend providing quantitative benchmarks to validate claims related to storage efficiency and retrieval latency on large-scale datasets.
