Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the worst-case performance of DiskANN, demonstrating that it can solve the approximate nearest neighbor problem with a constant approximation ratio, particularly with slow preprocessing. The authors provide empirical results comparing DiskANN with fast preprocessing, HNSW, and NSG, revealing hard instances that necessitate linear query time. The analysis is conducted in terms of doubling dimension, moving beyond previous works that relied on strict distribution assumptions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper provides a comprehensive theoretical analysis of graph-based nearest neighbor search, addressing a gap in existing literature.
2. It guarantees a constant approximation ratio for DiskANN with slow preprocessing, with clear proofs.
3. The work is the first to examine the impact of neighbor pruning on graph-based NNS performance.

Weaknesses:
1. The experimental section lacks theoretical guarantees for the Recall@5 metric, which complicates the evaluation of DiskANN's empirical performance.
2. The evaluation of algorithms on different setups makes it difficult to ascertain DiskANN's advantages over others.
3. The presentation of theoretical concepts, such as the definition of RobustPruning, could be clearer and more integrated into the main text.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by ensuring all algorithms are tested on the same hard examples and include both Recall@5 and approximation ratios. Additionally, it would be beneficial to illustrate performance figures using the fraction of considered nodes instead of Recall@5 as a function of L. For better comparison, we suggest plotting Recall@5 against the number of distance computations for both versions of DiskANN. 

To enhance clarity, we advise moving key definitions and descriptions, such as that of DiskANN and its variants, into the main text. Furthermore, it would be helpful to clarify the implications of the theoretical results, particularly after Theorem 3.4, and to address minor presentation issues, such as defining the aspect ratio in Section 2 and correcting typos. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide a clearer motivation for the hard synthetic examples used in the analysis.
