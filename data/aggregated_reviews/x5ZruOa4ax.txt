### Key Points
This paper presents CrossViViT, a multi-modal model designed for day-ahead solar global horizontal irradiance predictions, integrating spatial data from satellite RGB, IR, and vapor channels across Europe with time series data from six point-like stations, including clear sky, pressure, and irradiance metrics. The authors also propose a Multi Quantile version aimed at improving uncertainty estimation in regression tasks, particularly in forecasting. The manuscript includes a literature review on uncertainty extraction and discusses challenges in evaluating prediction intervals, referencing recent works advocating for simulation-based approaches. CrossViViT's performance is benchmarked against various statistical and numerical models, as well as state-of-the-art deep learning approaches utilizing transformer architectures, demonstrating superior predictive performance as evidenced by MAPE results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The application addresses significant real-world challenges in natural sciences, particularly concerning multi-modality and missing data.
- The authors distinguish between 'easy' and 'hard' prediction cases, a crucial aspect often overlooked in similar studies.
- The manuscript includes clarifications and details that enhance clarity, along with a literature review on uncertainty extraction.
- There is an open discussion of CrossViViT's strengths and limitations compared to other methods, highlighting its performance in 'hard' cases.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation could be enhanced by normalizing forecasting values or reporting MAPE to provide a clearer frame of reference for RMSE/MAE improvements.
- The evaluation of uncertainty estimation quality is not sufficiently robust, lacking comprehensive metrics.
- The authors dismiss the use of Fourier layers without adequate justification and have not fully explored their implications for practical applications.
- The discussion of findings lacks depth regarding their implications for real-world applications, including cost-effectiveness and environmental impact.
- The manuscript lacks clarity on the cross-attention mechanism and does not include the relevant equation.
- The paper does not adhere to the conference template, with issues in font size and figure margins.
- The color palette used is not accessible for color-blind individuals.
- The study is not reproducible due to the absence of provided code and no indication of future availability.
- The TAM station's location should be clarified in the map.
- The title could be improved for clarity and specificity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by normalizing forecasting values into a stated range or considering MAPE for a more comprehensive performance assessment. Additionally, we suggest incorporating additional metrics for evaluating uncertainty estimation quality and exploring simulation-based approaches as suggested by Sluijterman et al. (2023). We also recommend providing a clearer justification for the exclusion of Fourier layers and including the cross-attention equation in the manuscript. Expanding the discussion on the implications of findings for real-world applications, including cost-effectiveness and environmental impact, would enhance the paper's impact. Furthermore, we advise adherence to the conference paper template, improving accessibility for color-blind readers, and ensuring reproducibility by providing code. Clarifying the TAM station's location on the map and revising the title to a more conventional format would also be beneficial.
