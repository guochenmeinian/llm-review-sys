Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for estimating missing values in a non-completed matrix under the MNAR condition, where the observation probability depends on both the matrix index and value. The authors propose a nonparametric method that mitigates model selection bias by decoupling the observation probability into an index-dependent part and a non-negative function of the matrix value. They derive an upper bound on the estimation error in the Frobenius norm and address challenges related to scale and shift equivalence in optimization. The method is validated through experiments on real and synthetic data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The establishment of a nonparametric method to prevent model bias is commendable.
- The theoretical derivation of an upper bound on the error in missing value estimation is a significant contribution to the machine learning community.
- The general theory developed allows for minimal assumptions on the non-negative functions, accommodating non-uniform missing settings.
- The formulation of the missing value estimation problem as a convex optimization problem is a notable contribution.
- The elegant decoupling of $s$ and $t$ from the conditional likelihood enhances the method's robustness.

Weaknesses:
- The lack of source code raises concerns about reproducibility, particularly regarding the implementation of POCS in Algorithm 1. A description of the experimental environment, including operating system and programming language, would be beneficial.
- The term "ill-posed" requires a precise definition, along with a justification for why assumption 1 renders the missing value estimation well-posed.
- The experimental results with real data are not particularly promising, although this should not warrant rejection given the theoretical guarantees.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the term "ill-posed" and provide a proof of how assumption 1 leads to a well-posed problem. Additionally, the authors should ensure the source code is available to enhance reproducibility and provide a detailed description of the experimental environment. It would be helpful to include citations to support claims regarding nuclear norm regularization and the ill-posed nature of matrix completion under general MNAR. The authors should also clarify the definitions of various symbols used, particularly in relation to probability distributions and the inner product between matrices. Finally, a discussion on the influence of constants $\kappa$ and $\rho$ on the bounds in equation (7) and a comparison of computational times with competing approaches would strengthen the paper.
