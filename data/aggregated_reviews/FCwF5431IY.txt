Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a causal discovery method for directed cyclic graphs, employing a two-step Bayesian approach to reduce the dimensionality of functional data and learn causal structures from the resulting embeddings. The authors prove the identifiability of their model under specific assumptions, including disjoint cycles, and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, particularly brain EEG data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a relatively unexplored area of causal discovery in directed cyclic graphs, which is significant for applications involving cycles.
- The proposed method shows superior performance compared to various baselines across different settings.
- The causal identifiability proof and the application to brain EEG data provide valuable insights into brain region organization.

Weaknesses:
- The absence of classical and state-of-the-art baselines, such as NOTEARS, DAG-GNN, and CSIvA, limits the comparative analysis.
- Setting numerous priors for the model may be challenging in practical applications.
- The presentation, particularly Figure 1, lacks clarity and could be improved.
- The discussion of the brain EEG data results is insufficient for readers without a background in brain science, making it difficult to assess the significance of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the manuscript's presentation, particularly by clarifying Figure 1 and providing additional discussion on the brain EEG data results to help readers understand their significance. Additionally, we suggest including more classical and state-of-the-art baselines in the comparative analysis to strengthen the evaluation of the proposed method. Furthermore, addressing the challenges of setting priors in practical applications would enhance the model's applicability.
