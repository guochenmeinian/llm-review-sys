Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Hippo-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation method inspired by the hippocampal indexing theory of human memory, aimed at enhancing long-term knowledge storage and integration. The framework consists of offline indexing to extract and encode passages into a knowledge graph (KG) and online retrieval to extract entities from queries. Hippo-RAG demonstrates significant performance improvements on multi-hop question answering benchmarks compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method is novel and effectively mimics human long-term memory mechanisms, facilitating knowledge integration across passages.
2. It achieves substantial performance enhancements on challenging multi-hop QA benchmarks.
3. The paper is well-written, with clear presentation and sufficient detail for reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
1. The generalization of the method is limited, as it primarily focuses on multi-hop reasoning, potentially overlooking other scenarios requiring long-term memory.
2. The performance of the framework is heavily reliant on the named entity recognition (NER) capabilities of the language model, which may introduce significant errors.
3. Comparisons with baseline methods may be skewed due to the larger parameter sizes of Hippo-RAG, raising concerns about fairness in performance evaluation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalization of Hippo-RAG by exploring its applicability to other tasks that require long-term memory. Additionally, we suggest addressing the dependency on NER by incorporating fine-tuned NER models to enhance accuracy. Lastly, we encourage the authors to include a broader range of baseline comparisons, particularly from the KG-LLM literature, to ensure a fair evaluation of Hippo-RAG's performance.
