### Key Points
This paper presents a study on constructing satisficing paths to a Nash equilibrium from any initial strategy profile in n-player normal-form games. Satisficing paths generalize best-response paths, allowing players not best responding to update their strategies freely while maintaining those that are best responding. The authors affirm that every finite normal-form game possesses the satisficing paths property, suggesting implications for the design of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms, particularly in incorporating exploration periods among strategies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-structured and presents a novel concept of satisficing paths, which could significantly contribute to MARL research.  
- The rigorous proof demonstrating that finite normal-form games have the satisficing paths property addresses an important open question.  
- The findings that reward-deteriorating updates can lead to equilibrium are compelling and counterintuitive.  
- Practical implications for MARL algorithm design are clearly articulated, with suggestions for incorporating satisficing updates and exploratory strategies.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks empirical validation; experimental results or simulations would enhance the practical applicability of satisficing paths.  
- The complexity of the proof techniques may hinder accessibility for some readers; more intuitive explanations could improve understanding.  
- While valuable algorithmic insights are provided, the paper does not offer detailed guidance on implementing these insights in practical MARL algorithms.  
- There is confusion regarding the centralized nature of the algorithm and the process of discovering Nash equilibria, particularly in Cases 1 and 2.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical validation of their theoretical results by including experimental results or simulations to demonstrate the practical applicability of satisficing paths in real-world scenarios. Additionally, providing more intuitive explanations of the proof techniques would enhance accessibility for a broader audience. We also suggest including specific case studies to offer detailed guidance on implementing the proposed algorithmic insights in practical MARL algorithms. Finally, clarifying the process of discovering Nash equilibria and addressing the centralized versus decentralized nature of the algorithm would strengthen the paper's contributions.
