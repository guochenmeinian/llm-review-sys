### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of the relationship between word length and frequency, revisiting the classical Zipf's law and challenging the hypothesis proposed by Piantadosi et al. (2011) regarding word surprisal. The authors find that Zipf's law holds and that word frequency is a better predictor of word length than surprisal. They clarify Piantadosi's hypothesis and introduce a refined mathematical formula that minimizes channel capacity cost. The empirical assessment spans 13 languages using unbiased MLE estimators and monolingual transformers, demonstrating the superiority of Zipf's law in explaining the data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant topic in language complexity and provides a clear, well-organized presentation.
- It offers convincing experimental assessments and thorough analyses of results, contributing meaningfully to the field of computational linguistics.
- The study is well-written and combines sound modeling with a deep understanding of linguistic principles.

Weaknesses:
- There are minor points needing clarification, such as the relaxation of the wordform uniqueness condition and the meaning of "index of dispersion."
- Some aspects of the model's task and the effects of subword tokenization on results require further elaboration.
- The notation used in the paper could be made clearer to avoid confusion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of why the wordform uniqueness condition is relaxed in certain equations. Additionally, providing a clearer definition of "index of dispersion" would enhance understanding. Clarifying the model's task, particularly regarding the standard masked language modeling task, is necessary. We suggest comparing various subword tokenizations with different vocabularies to assess their impact on results, particularly with smaller vocabularies. Furthermore, discussing the effects of non-alphabetic scripts and their differences in behavior in relation to the findings would enrich the paper. Lastly, we advise adding a citation for Menzerath-Altmann's law to strengthen the theoretical foundation.
