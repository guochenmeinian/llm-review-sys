### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of how large language models (LLMs) understand temporal concepts in video processing. The authors analyze the limitations of current approaches, particularly the interaction between LLMs and pretrained visual encoders, and the dataset bias due to insufficient temporal annotations. They propose several promising future directions to enhance LLMs' temporal understanding, although the paper does not provide validated methods for these directions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with a clear and concise presentation that facilitates reader comprehension.
- It offers significant insights into the temporal understanding capabilities of LLMs, addressing critical challenges in contemporary model design.
- The analysis is thorough and comprehensive, covering recent advancements in the field.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks concrete evidence to support its claims, reading more like a position paper than a robust research contribution.
- Proposed solutions, such as co-evolving LLMs and enriching datasets with explicit temporal labels, lack necessary detail and rigor.
- There is an absence of experimental results, making some claims feel untested, and insufficient attention is given to practical challenges like scalability and computational costs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the title to clarify the performance of LLMs in short-term scenarios. Additionally, we suggest replacing Figure 1 with one that better illustrates a broader range of applications or challenges. Incorporating a figure and paragraph to outline the content and relationships between sections could enhance clarity. To strengthen the paper, we urge the authors to provide quantitative evaluations, implementation details, and empirical validation for their proposed solutions. Simplifying technical sections, such as spatiotemporal embeddings, and pairing them with visuals could also aid reader understanding.
