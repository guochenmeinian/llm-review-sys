Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for addressing the safe reinforcement learning (RL) problem with an unknown cost function by utilizing evaluator feedback as safety constraints. The authors propose a surrogate loss function that allows for segment-based feedback on trajectories, along with a novelty sampling mechanism to enhance learning efficiency. The effectiveness of their approach is demonstrated through experiments in various environments, showing significant improvements over baseline methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is generally well-written and clear, making it accessible even to those less familiar with the field.
2. The experimental results are promising, particularly in demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
3. The originality of the surrogate loss function and novelty sampling mechanism contributes to the paper's significance in integrating human feedback into RL.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the approach may be insufficient, as it lacks clarity on how it outperforms existing methods for inferring cost functions in RL.
2. The paper does not adequately demonstrate how closely the learned cost function approximates the ground truth.
3. The experimental section lacks detail and could benefit from additional ablations, particularly regarding the size of the feedback buffer and comparisons with other cost function learning methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the novelty and effectiveness of their approach by providing a more detailed comparison with existing methods for cost function inference. Additionally, it is crucial to demonstrate the accuracy of the learned cost function relative to the ground truth in the experiments to enhance trust in the results. We suggest including more detailed discussions around the introduced biases in estimation with varying \( c_{\max} \) values and addressing potential error modes beyond novel states. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the derivation of the surrogate loss and improve the presentation of experimental results, such as using bolded numbers in tables for better readability.
