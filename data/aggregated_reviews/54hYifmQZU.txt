Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new regret metric, Cost of Learning in Queueing (CLQ), to quantify the learning rate of optimal scheduling policies aimed at minimizing time-averaged queue lengths. The authors derive a lower bound for CLQ and demonstrate that an UCB-based policy approaches this bound. They extend their findings to multiple queues in a network setting by integrating the UCB policy with the Backpressure policy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The dependence of the regret bound on the slack parameter (epsilon) is optimal.
2. The CLQ metric is meaningful and well-suited for queueing systems, capturing early-stage dynamics effectively.
3. The UCB-based analysis is novel, requiring different bounds for the initial learning phase.
4. The analysis extends to queueing networks, providing a significant contribution to the field.

Weaknesses:
1. The results may provide a weaker bound compared to prior work, as Theorem 2 yields a linear bound on queue length regret, which is less robust than existing results.
2. The proposed algorithm's reliance on UCB does not introduce new technical insights.
3. The discussions on queueing networks lack detail, and the absence of simulations limits the demonstration of results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their comparison with prior work, particularly addressing how Theorem 2 provides a stronger bound than [34]. Additionally, the authors should enhance the exposition on queueing networks by providing detailed accounts of how specific models are represented in their framework. Including simulations would also strengthen the presentation of results. Lastly, we suggest that the authors consider a worst-case analysis over a range of horizon lengths starting from an arbitrary point, rather than from 1, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of CLQ's implications.
