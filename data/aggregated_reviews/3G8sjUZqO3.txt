Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new fractional programming-based algorithm for the multi-cluster normalized cut (Ncut) objective, utilizing a multidimensional quadratic transform. The authors propose the FPC method, which reformulates the Ncut problem into a solvable form and guarantees that the objective value monotonically increases during iterations. Experimental results indicate that FPC outperforms standard spectral clustering and recent methods like FINC and FCD across various datasets, achieving the lowest Ncut values and competitive performance metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and technically sound, demonstrating a novel application of the multidimensional quadratic form to the Ncut objective.
- The proposed FPC algorithm shows competitive results on small- to medium-sized benchmark datasets, outperforming existing methods in terms of Ncut values and clustering metrics.
- The writing is clear, and the proofs supporting the proposed arguments are complete.

Weaknesses:
- The datasets used for experiments are relatively small; the paper would benefit from demonstrating scalability to larger datasets.
- The connection to MM theory is introduced only in the conclusion, lacking earlier discussion in the main text.
- There is insufficient analysis of the convergence behavior of FPC, particularly regarding the potential for the algorithm to get stuck at sub-optimal points.
- The novelty of the reformulation of the Ncut problem and the optimization techniques employed is questioned, as they have been previously established in the literature.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis and experiments on the convergence of FPC by providing curves of the objective values during iterations to assess potential sub-optimality. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments on larger datasets to demonstrate the scalability of the method. It would also be beneficial to include a discussion of the connection to MM theory earlier in the paper. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore cases where the global optimum is known to better contextualize the improvements achieved by FPC compared to existing methods.
