### Key Points
This paper presents a multi-question generation model (mQG) that focuses on generating diverse and answerable questions from a given context. The authors propose a maximum question similarity loss (LMQS) to enhance question diversity and employ a recursive generation framework using BART. The study includes comprehensive evaluations, both automated and human, to validate the model's effectiveness, particularly through the use of the Self-BLEU metric.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of LMQS is innovative and relevant for promoting diversity in question generation.
- The evaluation is robust, incorporating various methods, including human feedback and zero-shot scenarios, to assess the quality and diversity of generated questions.
- Ablation studies provide valuable insights into the model's limitations and applications.

Weaknesses:
- The choice of BART as the base model lacks justification, especially when alternatives like T5 may perform better for question generation tasks.
- The combination of cross-entropy loss and LMQS needs further clarification, as it may create a trade-off between generating reference-like and diverse questions.
- The reliance on the Rouge-L F1 score for measuring question quality is criticized for potentially neglecting semantic similarity and not providing a comprehensive evaluation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for selecting BART over other models like T5, possibly by providing comparative performance data. Additionally, we suggest that the authors elaborate on the rationale behind combining LCE and LMQS in the loss function, addressing potential trade-offs. It would also be beneficial to discuss the limitations of using Rouge-L as a metric and consider incorporating additional diversity metrics for a more thorough evaluation. Lastly, we encourage the authors to enhance the clarity of their contributions in the introduction and streamline the visual elements in figures and tables for better readability.
