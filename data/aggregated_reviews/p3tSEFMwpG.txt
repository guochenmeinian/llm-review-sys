Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a modification of the TabPFN framework, termed Drift-Resilient TabPFN, to effectively address temporal distribution shifts in tabular data. The authors propose using two structural causal models (SCM) to model the prior for TabPFN: one for the gradual shift of inductive bias over time and another to model the shift of the first SCM. The method incorporates a novel prior that updates the SCM using hypernetworks, enabling the model to adapt to distribution shifts during inference. Empirical studies demonstrate significant performance improvements across various datasets, including comparisons against established benchmarks like Wild-Time and methods such as DRAIN and GI. The authors also acknowledge the challenges posed by temporal shifts and provide a thorough investigation into their model's performance against established baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses the practical issue of temporal shifts in tabular data, which is significant for real-world applications.
- The proposed method is intuitively appealing and logically extends the TabPFN framework.
- The authors provide robust experimental results that validate the effectiveness of their proposed method, demonstrating resilience against domain index ablation.
- The rewritten related work section significantly improves the paper, offering a thorough survey of relevant benchmarks and domain generalization (DG) methods.

Weaknesses:
- The comparison with existing methods like CatBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM may not be fair, as these do not explicitly consider temporal shifts.
- The ablation study lacks sufficient iterations for the Time2Vec variant, raising concerns about the reliability of the results.
- Key results from the evaluation of DG methods are buried in the appendix, making them less accessible and potentially undermining the perceived strength of the proposed method.
- The literature review is inadequate, missing discussions on domain generalization and robustness methods relevant to the study.
- Certain sections, such as the methodology in Section 3.1, lack clarity and could benefit from more detailed examples.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by including relevant studies on domain generalization and robustness, such as Shifts, Wild-Tab, and TableShift. Additionally, we suggest expanding the ablation study to include multiple trials for the Time2Vec variant and the no-T2V variant to ensure statistical significance and provide error estimates. Clarifying the model's input and output requirements, particularly regarding the observation of previous and future intervals, would enhance understanding. We also advise moving critical evaluation results from the appendix to the main text to improve visibility and clarity. Finally, we encourage the authors to revise Section 3.1 to include examples illustrating how to span the nodes and graph, and to expand the discussion regarding related works and provide further explanations or verifications for their claims.
