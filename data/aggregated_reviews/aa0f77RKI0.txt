Aggregated Review:
**Key Points**  
We find that the paper presents an excellent end-to-end pipeline from training to deployment, showcasing great accuracy and efficiency. The source code ensures comprehensive reproducibility. However, there are several areas needing clarification and improvement, particularly regarding figures, implementation details, and the loss function.

**Strengths and Weaknesses**  
Strengths include a well-written and clear description of the methodology, effective figures that support understanding, and an efficient pipeline compiled in C++. Weaknesses involve unclear elements in figures, missing explanations for certain components, and typographical errors. Specifically, the C++ implementation's dependency on the authors' computer raises concerns about its performance in different environments.

**Suggestions for Improvement**  
We suggest the following improvements:  
1. In Fig. 1, the output of the prompt encoder should be indicated alongside the image embeddings.  
2. In Fig. 2, the purple masks and boxes should be made more apparent with a brighter color.  
3. The font in figures should be changed to Times New Roman.  
4. In Table 6, the reason for MedSAM's N/A on runtime and memory usage should be clarified for readers unfamiliar with the challenge.  
5. In section 2.2 on the loss function, further explanation is needed regarding why Focal Loss deserves more attention, and the derivation of the 20:1 ratio of Focal loss to dice loss should be detailed.  
6. Distillation details for the prompt encoder and mask decoder should be included.  
7. Correct the typo in section 2.4 from "Futher" to "Further" and add missing vertical lines for tables in the Experiments section.
