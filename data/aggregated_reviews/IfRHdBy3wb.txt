Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel local-level post-hoc GNN explainer called GOAt, which addresses the issues of discriminability and consistency in graph explanations. The GOAt explainer attributes GNN predictions to input graph features using the Equal Contribution technique and is implemented for GCN, GraphSAGE, and GIN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GOAt outperforms state-of-the-art GNN explainers in fidelity, discriminability, and stability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The focus on discriminability and consistency in GNN explanations is innovative and fills a gap in existing research.  
2. The mathematical derivation of the Equal Contribution technique is robust and supports the design of the GOAt explainer.  
3. The experiments validating GOAt's superiority are comprehensive and well-discussed.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The effectiveness of the attribution strategy based on Equal Contribution is not intuitively clear, leaving the motivation behind GOAt insufficiently illustrated.  
2. The manuscript's organization and writing require improvement, as some content is confusing, such as the claim regarding occurrences and unique variables.  
3. The use of a zero-vector as the base manifold leads to equal contributions for all variables, which may not adequately reflect their individual values.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind the Equal Contribution strategy to enhance understanding of its impact on discriminability and stability. Additionally, we suggest reorganizing the manuscript for better flow and clarity, particularly in explaining complex concepts. It would be beneficial to clarify the implications of using a zero-vector as the base manifold and consider addressing the value of variables in the contribution calculations. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide detailed illustrations or examples in the introduction to strengthen the argument regarding the limitations of existing methods.
