Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Frequency-enhanced Data Augmentation (FDA) technique aimed at improving generalization and robustness in vision-language navigation (VLN) tasks. The authors analyze the impact of high-frequency information on performance and demonstrate that their method outperforms prior work on R2R, RxR, and CVDN datasets. The proposed approach involves mixing high-frequency components from reference and interference images using FFT, which is shown to enhance model performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is clearly written and easy to follow.
- The FDA technique effectively improves performance across various models and datasets without adding complexity.
- The investigation into the Fourier domain provides a novel perspective on VLN tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The premise is somewhat confusing, as high and low-frequency perturbed images represent different domains, leading to performance drops. Additionally, low-frequency information appears to aid performance on certain splits.
- The experimental comparisons are limited, focusing primarily on one data augmentation method (ENVEDIT) without exploring other relevant techniques.
- There are discrepancies in reported performance metrics, and several low-level calculation errors are present throughout the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the premise regarding high and low-frequency information and provide a more thorough analysis of the impact of frequency on performance. Additionally, we suggest conducting ablation studies that include comparisons with other data augmentation techniques to strengthen the experimental results. It would also be beneficial to address the discrepancies in reported performance metrics and ensure all calculations are accurate. Lastly, consider including qualitative examples to illustrate the effectiveness of the FDA technique in achieving navigation goals.
