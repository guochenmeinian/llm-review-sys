### Key Points
This paper presents a strategy called Self-Polishing (SP) aimed at enhancing the performance of reasoning tasks by refining problem formats. The authors propose that SP can be effectively combined with existing methods, such as Chain-of-Thoughts, to simplify complex problems for large language models (LLMs). The main contributions include thorough experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of few-shot demonstrations and a systematic framework for problem refinement.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper explores a novel idea of problem-side refinement, which has not been extensively covered in prior research.  
- Thorough experiments show significant improvements in reasoning tasks.  
- The Self-Polishing strategy appears effective when combined with Chain-of-Thoughts.  

Weaknesses:  
- The refinement approach may be overly simplistic, as noted in the limitations, and lacks depth in exploring problem decomposition.  
- Many sub-ideas are derived from existing works, leading to concerns about the originality of the contributions.  
- The In-context Self-Polish concept is vague and lacks analysis regarding the effects of human curation.  
- The background section is deficient in references to prior research, particularly before 2022.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the depth of their exploration into how to refine problems, including a detailed discussion on performance differences among various SP methods. Additionally, we suggest providing a comparative analysis of In-context Self-Polish with other curation methods to clarify its effectiveness. It would also be beneficial to include more references to earlier works in the background section to contextualize the research better. Lastly, enhancing the clarity and informativeness of Figure 1 by pairing it with a real example from Figure 2 is advisable.
