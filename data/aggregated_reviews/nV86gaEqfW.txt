Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ExpressPQDelivery, a protocol designed to efficiently transport large post-quantum (PQ) keys by leveraging DNS infrastructure. The authors conduct extensive experiments demonstrating a 27% reduction in network latency when using this method with TLS 1.3. However, the significance of the problem being addressed is questioned, and the paper lacks sufficient background on the relevance of post-quantum cryptography. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The use of DNS infrastructure for key delivery is innovative and could enhance performance.
- The protocol is deployable, making it relevant for real-world applications, particularly in IoT.
- Experimental results provide empirical support for the proposed solution.

Weaknesses:
- The paper does not adequately explain how clients determine the number of fragments or ensure their accurate retrieval and assembly.
- Insufficient security analysis regarding the risks of fragment loss or interception, and potential key exposure.
- The novelty of the approach is questioned, as it may not significantly improve upon existing methods for key delivery.
- The design decisions lack clear motivation, and the implications of using DNS for key storage and retrieval are not thoroughly addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the background information to clarify the importance of the problem being solved in the context of post-quantum cryptography. Additionally, the authors should provide more detailed descriptions of their novelty and the specific advantages of their scheme over traditional methods. It is essential to elaborate on the mechanisms for fragment retrieval and reconstruction, including how to handle scenarios where fragments are lost or intercepted. A comprehensive security analysis should be included to demonstrate the robustness of the protocol against potential attacks. Finally, the authors should consider discussing the feasibility of using a trusted certificate authority instead of relying solely on DNS for E-Box storage.
