Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the challenge of geo-diverse safety standards, where legally compliant and culturally sensitive responses vary by context. The authors propose a benchmark designed to evaluate helpfulness and cultural sensitivity across diverse global contexts, an automatic evaluation framework for assessing LLMs on this benchmark, and a model that performs well on it. The findings indicate that existing LLMs perform poorly on this benchmark, but the finetuned LLM shows significant improvement.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The focus on geographic diversity is compelling, addressing an understudied area of critical importance.  
- The benchmark is well-designed, demonstrating that current LLMs struggle with contextual adherence to cultural norms and legal standards.  
- The paper includes substantial empirical analysis and validations using human evaluation to complement automated methodologies.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper should more explicitly address limitations, such as the evolving nature of cultural and legal rules and the heterogeneity within cultural groups.  
- Clarity issues hinder understanding; more qualitative examples would enhance the explanation of methods and demonstrate effectiveness.  
- Some design decisions, like the number of guidelines per country in GeoSafeDB, lack justification.  
- The finetuning results need contextualization against other baselines to clarify their significance.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by providing more qualitative examples to explain methods and demonstrate effectiveness. Additionally, the authors should justify design decisions, such as the number of guidelines per country in GeoSafeDB. It would be beneficial to contextualize finetuning results by comparing them to other baselines, such as prompts containing ground-truth policy or a retrieval pipeline over the databank of policies. Furthermore, we suggest using standard terminology of accuracy and recall in Sec 4.2 instead of introducing new terms like faithfulness and coverage.
