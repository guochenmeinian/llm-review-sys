Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel explicit and structured 3D representation called GaussianCube, which integrates with U-Net diffusion models for 3D generation. The authors propose a two-step process to transition from unstructured 3D Gaussians to GaussianCube: 1) densification-constrained fitting to limit the number of Gaussians, and 2) structuralization via optimal transport to convert the unstructured point cloud into a structured voxel grid. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through extensive experiments on various datasets, including unconditional and conditional generation tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of structure into unstructured 3D Gaussians is a simple yet effective innovation that enhances compatibility with standard diffusion model architectures.
- The application of optimal transport for voxelization is both novel and elegant, potentially leading to optimized network architectures for other 3D tasks.
- The paper is well-presented, with a clear main approach and extensive experimental validation, showcasing strong performance across multiple tasks and datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity regarding the diffusion process on 3D Gaussians, particularly concerning the distribution of parameters and the implications for valid rotations and offsets.
- The optimal transport illustration is not intuitive, and the paper does not adequately address related work or provide a comprehensive state-of-the-art comparison.
- There is insufficient analysis of time and memory requirements for the method, which is crucial for understanding the reimplementation challenges.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the diffusion process on 3D Gaussians, particularly by detailing the implications of parameter distributions and the representation of rotations. The explanation regarding the replacement of positions with offsets should be presented earlier in the paper. Additionally, we suggest including a more intuitive illustration of optimal transport and addressing the missing related work and baseline comparisons. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide a detailed analysis of time and memory requirements for their method to aid in understanding its practical implementation challenges.
