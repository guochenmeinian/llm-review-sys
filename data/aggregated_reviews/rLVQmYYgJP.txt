### Key Points
This paper presents an application of LoRA fine-tuning on the Mistral 7B model for TNM staging classification tasks using breast cancer pathology reports. The authors curated a dataset of anonymized reports labeled by subject matter experts, achieving promising results. However, the paper lacks clarity on certain medical terminologies and the implications of the results, particularly regarding the differences in sample counts and the potential impact of deploying the model.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper demonstrates a technically sound approach with well-supported experimental results.
- Creative data augmentation techniques are employed, including the use of an UNKNOWN label class and JSON-enforced output.
- The model's ability to cite relevant information and the reporting of training time and performance metrics are commendable.

Weaknesses:
- The methodology for data augmentation is not clearly described, raising concerns about the quality and realism of the generated pathology reports.
- There is insufficient detail on the labeling process, including the qualifications of the labelers and how labeling disagreements were resolved.
- The paper does not explore the generalizability of the model across different foundational models or the impact of report quality on results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of medical terminology, such as providing a brief introduction to TNM staging and its challenges for non-clinical audiences. Additionally, please provide more information on the labeling process, including the number of experts involved and how label reliability was ensured. It would also be beneficial to clarify the data augmentation methodology and validate the realism of the generated reports. Finally, consider including a broader evaluation across multiple tasks to enhance the significance of the findings.
