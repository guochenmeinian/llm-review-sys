Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents FlexMol, a toolkit aimed at enhancing the benchmarking process for Molecular Relational Learning (MRL), which is vital for understanding molecular interactions in drug discovery. FlexMol allows for the dynamic construction of over 70,000 distinct models and supports various data input types, making it a significant advancement over existing frameworks. The authors provide a comprehensive evaluation of FlexMol, including detailed code examples and tutorials to ensure reproducibility.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The manuscript is well-written, intuitive, and effectively summarizes the challenges in MRL.
- FlexMol's user-friendly API lowers barriers for users and supports a wide range of model architectures.
- The toolkit facilitates fair comparisons across different datasets and metrics, enhancing reproducibility in research.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks detailed examples of real-world applications, such as drug repurposing, which could illustrate FlexMol's practical utility.
- The discussion on supported datasets is insufficient, and it is unclear whether the toolkit supports various splitting strategies beyond random splits.
- There is a need for more clarity on how users can load custom data and utilize custom metrics within FlexMol.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of uncertainty prediction as a metric for model training, referencing "Assigning confidence to molecular property prediction." Additionally, the authors should explore the synergy between property predictors and generative models, citing "Tartarus: A benchmarking platform for realistic and practical inverse molecular design." Providing examples of implementing state-of-the-art methods using FlexMol would better demonstrate its robustness. Furthermore, clarifying the data format requirements and the ability to add custom metrics would enhance user accessibility. Lastly, consider modifying experiments to include interaction layers like cross-attention to assess their impact on results.
