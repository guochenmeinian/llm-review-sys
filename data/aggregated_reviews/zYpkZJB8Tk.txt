### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of anti-Asian racism on social media, focusing on the nuances between sub-ethnic Asian groups. The authors utilize a 12-month dataset from X, employing toxicity score-based persistence analysis, n-gram-based Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), and topic modeling-based Spearmanâ€™s rank correlation. The study highlights the importance of a disaggregated approach to understanding anti-Asian narratives, particularly noting that existing models may not adequately address the diversity within sub-ethnic groups. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to understand, with clear experimental descriptions and methodologies.
- The topic is timely and relevant, addressing an under-studied area of social media discourse.
- The classification task is well-executed, and the sampling strategy appears reasonable.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the work is limited, as the methods employed are largely off-the-shelf.
- There is a lack of depth in the findings, primarily conveying a single core message about the differences within sub-ethnic groups.
- The paper lacks an ethics or limitations section, which is critical given the sensitive nature of the topic.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their findings by providing more examples and explanations, particularly for unexpected results, such as the peak in toxicity during political events in 2019. Specifically, they should present examples of tweets classified as toxic during this period to clarify the motivations behind these messages. Additionally, further elaboration on the relationship between K-pop topics and toxicity is necessary. 

We also suggest that the authors clarify Figure 1c regarding the proportions represented and define the baseline group for the proportions of tweets referencing each ethnicity. 

Furthermore, we encourage the authors to discuss potential biases related to their focus on Twitter and the implications for generalizability. Including performance metrics for the classifier, such as precision, recall, and F-1 scores by class, would enhance the technical quality of the paper. Lastly, an ethics section addressing data safety and IRB considerations should be included to strengthen the paper's integrity.
