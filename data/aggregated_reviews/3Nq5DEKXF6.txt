### Key Points
This paper investigates the Budget Limited Coreness Maximization (BLCM) problem, which aims to enhance average user engagement by inserting a limited number of edges to maximize coreness gain in a graph. The authors prove that BLCM is NP-hard, APX-hard, and not submodular. They propose three edge insertion strategies: Leader-Centric Greedy Insertion (LCGI), Group-Centric Greedy Insertion (GCGI), and Leader-Group Balance (LGB), and validate their effectiveness through experiments on 13 real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a precise definition of the BLCM problem and rigorously establishes its computational complexity.
- Three novel combinatorial edge insertion strategies are introduced.
- Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for the proposed problem is not sufficiently clear, and the relationship between BLCM and KM problems is inadequately explored.
- The presentation is complex, with many notations that could benefit from illustrative examples and a symbol table for clarity.
- The proposed algorithms are heuristic and lack guarantees on approximation ratios, and their performance on larger datasets is questioned.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for the BLCM problem by providing specific real-world examples to demonstrate its relevance. Additionally, a more thorough discussion on the similarities and differences between BLCM and KM problems would enhance understanding. We suggest including illustrative examples in Section 4.1 to clarify concepts and enhance comprehension. Furthermore, addressing the time complexity of the Layer Decomposition process in Theorem 4.2 and justifying the choice of datasets for testing the Exact algorithm would strengthen the paper. Lastly, providing a symbol table and comparing all proposed algorithms in the experiments would improve accessibility and fairness in evaluation.
