Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on online learning under clean-label attacks, proposing a sequential prediction framework that incorporates abstention when classifiers lack confidence. The authors introduce a new loss function that penalizes abstention on non-adversarial examples while exempting adversarial examples. They provide an error bound of \(O(d^2 \log T)\) for classes with VC dimension \(d\) over a time horizon \(T\), assuming access to the marginal distribution of iid examples. Additionally, they present a \(O(\sqrt{T})\) bound for concept classes with VC dimension 1 without such access. The authors also propose a theoretical framework for learning in online prediction, asserting that the learner can make predictions using a class of functions \(\mathcal{F}\), which includes both total and partial functions. They claim that the realizability assumption holds when the labels generated respect the ground truth function \(f^*\), although this claim has been challenged by reviewers. The discussion emphasizes the distinction between the hypothesis class and the concept class, with the authors acknowledging confusion in terminology and committing to clarifications in future revisions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper explores a novel setting of sequential prediction that effectively models abstention against clean-label attacks, with well-motivated technical material.
- The model introduces a novel approach to online learning, particularly in sequential prediction scenarios.
- The authors identify future research directions and connections to existing learning theory literature, enhancing the paper's relevance.
- The theoretical contributions are recognized as significant, with potential implications for understanding complexity measures like VC dimension and Littlestone dimension.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity in defining key concepts, such as "sequential prediction," and contains several confusing definitions and notations.
- The use of terms like "hypothesis class" and "realizability" has led to misunderstandings, with reviewers arguing that the authors' definitions deviate from standard interpretations in the literature.
- The error bounds may be overly loose, and the assumption of perfect access to the marginal distribution is considered too strong.
- The practical applicability of the proposed algorithm remains a concern, with some reviewers questioning its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
- The novelty of the proposed protocol is questioned, as it primarily involves adding an abstention option to existing methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of definitions and concepts, particularly by explicitly defining "sequential prediction" and distinguishing between the hypothesis and concept classes. Additionally, we suggest addressing the limitations of the proposed approach in a clearly marked paragraph and providing empirical evaluations to demonstrate the practical applicability of their theoretical results. We also recommend that the authors clarify their definitions regarding the hypothesis class and realizability, particularly in the introduction and Protocol section, and explicitly state that \(f^*\) is a legitimate hypothesis within \(\mathcal{F}\). Furthermore, we encourage the authors to address the implications of extending \(\mathcal{F}\) to include partial functions on the complexity parameters discussed in the paper. Finally, we urge the authors to include more empirical evidence to support their theoretical claims, as this could enhance the practical relevance of their work.
