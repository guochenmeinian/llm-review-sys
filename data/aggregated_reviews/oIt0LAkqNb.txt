### Key Points
This paper presents an Out-of-Distribution (OOD) benchmark called Incremental Shift OOD (IS-OOD) that categorizes test samples based on varying degrees of semantic and covariate shifts, utilizing the Language Aligned Image feature Decomposition (LAID) method. The authors employ CLIP text/image features for dataset division and synthetically generate additional images using SDXL-Turbo to create the Synthetic Incremental Shift (Syn-IS) dataset. The work aims to better evaluate and analyze OOD detection methods for image classification tasks, revealing that OOD detection performance is sensitive to semantic shifts, while excessive covariate shifts can also influence detection outcomes. However, the benchmark may not encompass all types of distribution shifts encountered in real-world applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The IS-OOD benchmark offers a nuanced evaluation of OOD detection methods, effectively addressing the Sorites Paradox.
2. The LAID method provides an innovative approach to measuring semantic and covariate shifts.
3. The Syn-IS dataset enhances the benchmark by introducing high-quality generated images with diverse covariate contents.
4. The paper is mostly clearly written and well-structured, with available code and data, contributing valuable insights to the field.

Weaknesses:
1. There is no formal definition of semantic and covariate shifts, leading to inaccuracies in Figures 1 and 4.
2. The equations assume predetermined separations for data points with semantic/covariate shifts, but the basis for this separation is unclear.
3. The reliance on the CLIP model for the LAID method may compromise the accuracy of shift measurements due to alignment imperfections.
4. The measurement of shifts relies on CLIP feature similarity, which is a simplistic approach.
5. Experimental results show weak correlations between performance metrics and covariate shifts, indicating potential issues with dataset construction.
6. The unique patterns in the Syn-IS dataset could differ from real images, affecting the generalizability of findings.
7. Minor grammatical errors detract from the overall readability of the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors formally introduce semantic and covariate shifts at the beginning of Section 2 to clarify their definitions.
2. We suggest providing a clear explanation of how the separation for data points with semantic/covariate shifts was determined, particularly regarding the "covariate parts."
3. We encourage the authors to explore more robust methods for measuring shifts beyond CLIP feature similarity and address the gap between CLIP's text and image feature spaces.
4. We recommend revisiting the dataset split to address the weak correlations observed in the experimental results and to improve the generalizability of findings.
5. We suggest that the authors consider presenting F1 and FPR95 metrics alongside AUC/AP for a more comprehensive summary of OOD method performance.
6. We recommend improving the discussion on potential biases in the benchmark datasets and evaluated models by including a dedicated section on bias and fairness analysis.
7. To increase accessibility, providing detailed guidelines for implementing the benchmark and considering a simplified version for lower-resource settings would be advantageous.
8. Expanding the discussion on the ethical and social implications of deploying OOD detection systems is crucial, along with offering concrete recommendations for future research directions to guide further exploration in this area.
