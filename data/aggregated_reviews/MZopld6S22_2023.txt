Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a modularized codebase for 3D-aware image synthesis that integrates NeRF into the GAN generator, aimed at advancing 3D-aware image synthesis methods while identifying limitations within existing techniques. The authors propose a codebase that allows users to easily replace modules, achieving on-par or superior reproduction results compared to existing methods. Key contributions include a modular design that facilitates experimentation and analysis of various components, along with performance evaluations across multiple metrics such as FID and reprojection error. Additionally, the authors aim to enhance user accessibility by preparing a README file and example scripts, while discussing challenges in the domain to inspire future research efforts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The modularized design simplifies the implementation of various 3D-aware image synthesis methods, making it accessible for beginners.
- Comprehensive analyses of different modules provide valuable insights for future research.
- The codebase demonstrates competitive reproduction results, indicating its effectiveness.
- The authors effectively address reviewer concerns, leading to improved ratings.
- The identification of significant challenges in 3D-aware image synthesis is valuable for the research community.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a detailed tutorial or user guide, which is essential for beginners to navigate the modular system effectively.
- Discussions on future work and limitations are insufficiently detailed, particularly regarding critical bottlenecks in the current implementation.
- The maintenance plan for the codebase lacks specificity and feasibility, raising concerns about long-term support.
- There is insufficient discussion on module flexibility regarding the addition of priors and deformation for non-rigid methods.
- Certain datasets and methods, such as CompCars and GIRAFFE, are not included in the evaluations, limiting the scope of the analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the documentation by providing a well-written tutorial/user guide to assist beginners in utilizing the modularized codebase effectively. Additionally, we suggest adding more detailed discussions on future work and limitations, clarifying whether certain features are unsupported or simply lack experimentation. It would also be beneficial to include evaluations on missing datasets like CompCars and GIRAFFE, and to address the memory cost and training/test speed comparisons with existing implementations. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity and specificity of the maintenance plan to assure users of long-term support for the codebase, and include a more concrete discussion on module flexibility for adding priors and deformation when extending the codebase to non-rigid methods.
