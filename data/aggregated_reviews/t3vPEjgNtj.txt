Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents QuadAttack, a novel method for generating ordered top-K adversarial perturbations using a quadratic programming (QP) formulation. The authors propose a two-stage approach that first computes an adversarial perturbation to the representation under top-K constraints, followed by input modification to match this representation. The method aims to enhance robustness against adversarial attacks by focusing on harder-to-detect perturbations and extends the top-K attack from 10 to 15 classes, demonstrating improved attack success rates and query efficiency across various datasets and architectures.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively argues for the significance of ordered top-K adversarial perturbations, contributing to the development of more robust systems.
- The proposed two-stage approach allows the use of optimization methods beyond gradient descent, leveraging QP on the representation and gradient-based input modification.
- Empirical results indicate that QuadAttack achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates while maintaining a low computational budget.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for computing ordered top-K adversarial attacks is either too general or vague, lacking clarity on its practical implications.
- Presentation issues exist, such as unclear figures and tables, and inaccuracies in equations (e.g., the second row of \(D_T\) in equation 8 and missing terms in equation 12).
- The paper does not adequately discuss practical applications of the proposed attack or provide a theoretical analysis of its computational cost, which raises questions about its efficiency claims.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for ordered top-K attacks, providing specific practical applications to highlight their importance. Additionally, the authors should address the presentation issues by refining figures and tables, and correcting inaccuracies in the equations. It would also be beneficial to include a theoretical discussion on the computational complexity of the method and to demonstrate baseline performance under configurations that reflect their original design, such as 9x30, to substantiate claims of efficiency.
