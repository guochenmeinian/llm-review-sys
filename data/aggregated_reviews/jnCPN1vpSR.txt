Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for discovering closed-form Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), termed D-CIPHER, which is designed to handle a class of PDEs referred to as variational-ready PDEs. The authors claim that this framework is less restrictive than existing methods, allowing for the recovery of a broader population of equations. The paper includes a novel optimization scheme, a unique variational loss function, and empirical evidence from synthetic datasets to support its claims.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents a comprehensive evaluation of various PDEs, demonstrating notable improvements over existing methods.
- The clarity of the exposition balances technical details with general introductions, making it accessible even to those outside the ODE/PDE field.
- The novel variational loss function and the clear identification of challenges in the introduction are particularly impressive.

Weaknesses:
- The setup of the problem lacks sufficient insight, making some introduced terms less convincing.
- Section 7 is too brief to adequately showcase the novelty of the optimization scheme, which needs better presentation.
- There is insufficient evidence supporting claims regarding robustness against noisy or infrequent observations.
- The significance of the framework's real-world applications is not well-grounded, and the paper would benefit from more concrete examples and discussions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the problem setup by providing deeper insights into the introduced terms. Additionally, Section 7 should be expanded to better highlight the novelty of the optimization scheme. To support claims about robustness, we suggest including theoretical discussions on the impact of sampling frequency and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, we encourage the authors to discuss the effects of different test functions, such as B-splines, and consider parameterizing the test functions to make them learnable. Lastly, incorporating real-world data experiments or a more extensive discussion on potential applications would enhance the paper's significance.
