Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for text-driven image-to-image translation tasks through the introduction of Conditional Score Guidance (CSG). The authors propose a conditional score function that integrates both the source image and text, alongside the target text, comprising a standard score function and a guiding score function. Additionally, the paper introduces a cross-attention mixup strategy to enhance image translation quality. Experimental results indicate the proposed method's superior performance across various tasks, supported by a new evaluation metric, Relational Distance, which measures the fidelity of relational information between images pre- and post-translation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper provides a detailed theoretical explanation of the algorithm and setup, establishing a robust foundation for the study.
2. The novel mixup method enhances conditional score guidance and effectively combines outputs from cross-attention layers.
3. Comprehensive experimentation and qualitative/quantitative measures substantiate the claims, showcasing superiority over state-of-the-art methods in most cases.
4. The introduction of the Relational Distance metric is a significant contribution, quantifying the preservation of relational information in translated images.

Weaknesses:
1. There is a lack of clarity regarding the practicality of the proposed method, particularly concerning computational costs (time, memory) and efficiency compared to other techniques.
2. The experiments are limited to one pre-trained model (Stable Diffusion), necessitating additional experiments with other pre-trained methods to demonstrate broader generalizability.
3. The limitations of the method are insufficiently covered, with no extensive discussion on scenarios where it may not perform well.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the computational cost and efficiency of the proposed method compared to existing techniques. Additionally, conducting experiments with various pre-trained models would enhance the generalizability of the findings. It is crucial to include a thorough discussion of the method's limitations and potential failure scenarios, particularly regarding the quality of source images and complex prompts. Furthermore, we suggest providing a clearer delineation of how the proposed method extends beyond the capabilities of pix2pix-zero to elevate its novelty.
