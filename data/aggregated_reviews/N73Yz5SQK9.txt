### Key Points
This paper presents a novel hypergraph generative model called HyRec, which utilizes the Kronecker product to replicate power-law and log-logistic distributions observed in real-world hypergraphs. The authors propose SingFit, an efficient algorithm for parameter estimation, supported by extensive experiments demonstrating HyRec's capability to accurately fit and extrapolate hypergraph structures across various datasets. The paper also provides mathematical proofs validating HyRec's adherence to key structural properties of hypergraphs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The introduction of the HyRec model significantly extends traditional graph generation methods to hypergraphs, addressing the need for modeling complex group interactions.  
- The theoretical foundation, including proofs of power-law and log-logistic distribution replication, enhances the model's interpretability and applicability.  
- The paper is well-structured and accessible, providing tools for generating synthetic hypergraphs useful for testing algorithms and simulating complex systems.  

Weaknesses:  
- The focus on power-law patterns may limit the model's applicability to datasets that do not conform to these distributions, reducing generalizability.  
- The underlying mechanisms driving the dynamic evolution of hypergraphs are not thoroughly explained, necessitating more in-depth analysis.  
- The paper lacks detailed comparisons with existing models, which could strengthen its claims regarding HyRec's advantages.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization of fragmented sections, such as Section 2, by merging related parts to enhance logical flow and readability. In Section 3.3, we suggest providing a more precise mathematical formulation of the log-logistic distribution and clarifying its relationship with the power-law distribution. Additionally, please address the formatting issue at the bottom of Section 4 and correct the multiple citation errors throughout the paper to ensure consistency. 

We also recommend clarifying the reference to the relationship between the power-law and log-normal distributions in Section 4.1 to avoid confusion. Furthermore, a clearer comparison with prior work and a discussion of the novel contributions of this paper would strengthen the presentation of its significance. Lastly, consider simplifying the experimental section to avoid overwhelming readers with dense tables and figures.
