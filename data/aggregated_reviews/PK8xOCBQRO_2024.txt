Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on transfer learning for estimating edge probabilities in random graphs under latent position models. The authors propose an algorithm to estimate the edge probability matrix \( Q \) from a source graph \( P \) and a submatrix of \( Q \). They assume both matrices are generated by latent position models, where the edge probabilities are defined through HÃ¶lder-smooth symmetric functions. The authors derive a high-probability tail bound for their estimation algorithm and establish information-theoretic lower bounds under the stochastic block model (SBM). The algorithms are evaluated through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with a thorough motivation for the problem and extensive literature review. Definitions and mathematical statements are well-supported by intuition and examples.
- It provides what appears to be the first provably consistent algorithm for transfer learning in graphs, with a simple and elegant solution. The derived high-probability tail bounds and lower bounds demonstrate the method's optimality under specific conditions.
- The experiments effectively illustrate the proposed approach's performance.

Weaknesses:
- The setup only considers graphs with expected node degrees growing linearly, which may not reflect many real-world sparse networks. The authors claim applicability for node degrees of order \( \Theta(n^{1/2}) \) but do not clarify the basis for this belief.
- Figure 1 lacks clarity, leaving some reviewers confused about its implications.
- The experimental focus is primarily on synthetic tasks, which may limit the practical applicability of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Figure 1 by providing additional explanations. Furthermore, we suggest including discussions on the implications of their model assumptions and conducting further numerical experiments to validate the theoretical results. Addressing the applicability of their algorithm to graphs with sub-linear expected node degrees would also strengthen the paper. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore real-world datasets to enhance the practical relevance of their findings.
