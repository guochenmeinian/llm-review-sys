Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for approximating the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) and its fractional counterpart using positive semi-definite (PSD) models. The authors demonstrate that for a specified accuracy $\epsilon$, a PSD model can be constructed with a dimension bounded by $\epsilon^{-(d+1)/(\beta - 2s)}(\log 1/\epsilon)^{d+1}$ to approximate the corresponding partial differential equation (PDE). By integrating this result with a PSD model-based sampling method, the authors provide a framework for sampling solutions of the stochastic differential equation (SDE) associated with the FPE at any time $t$.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The article features clear and logical writing, facilitating understanding of the problem formulation and the fundamental concepts of the PSD model.
2. It introduces a novel application of the PSD model, contributing significantly to the literature.
3. The authors propose a new design approach for sampling based on SDEs, combining existing techniques to offer fresh insights into sampling methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a thorough analysis of the influence of initial conditions on the PDE solution, which would enhance the theoretical completeness.
2. There is a need for comparative analysis of the PSD model-based sampling method against traditional methods like Langevin Monte Carlo, particularly regarding sampling performance and approximation methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis by addressing the impact of initial conditions on the solution of the PDE and characterizing the approximation of these conditions. Additionally, we suggest that the authors compare the effectiveness of the PSD model-based sampling method with traditional methods, providing insights through complexity analysis or experimental results. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the algorithm's implementation details, including the role of $q$ and the process for computing the model $\hat{A}_m$. Lastly, simplifying theorem statements and providing experimental evidence would strengthen the paper's persuasiveness and clarity.
