Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents approximation algorithms for the submodular cover problem (SCP), focusing on finding the smallest subset \( S \) such that a submodular function \( f(S) \) meets a specified threshold. The authors propose a fast algorithm for monotone functions that offers similar guarantees to greedy algorithms while being significantly faster. They also extend their results to non-monotone functions and introduce the regularized submodular cover problem, presenting bicriteria algorithms for it. The paper includes experimental comparisons with baseline methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The authors make significant contributions to submodular cover optimization, with algorithms that are simple and well-explained.  
- The experimental section is well-organized, utilizing commonly accepted datasets, and the results effectively illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the work, supporting theoretical guarantees.  
- The paper improves query complexity for the monotone SCP algorithm from \( O(n^2) \) to \( O(n \log n) \).  
- The use of a powerful framework leads to novel algorithms and new problem formulations, expanding the scope of SCP/SMP conversions.

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty of the work is unclear, as the algorithms and proof techniques resemble established literature.  
- Exponential time algorithms are impractical in many scenarios, and the justification provided is unconvincing.  
- The results for the regularized SCP are less compelling compared to other findings.  
- Critical typos exist in theorem statements, making it difficult to grasp the main results, particularly regarding algorithm definitions and parameters.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their theorem statements, particularly ensuring that algorithm names and parameters are correctly defined and consistent throughout the paper. Specifically, the algorithm referred to as "threshold-bi" should be corrected to "threshold-greedy-c," and the parameter \( \alpha \) in Theorem 2 should be clearly defined. Additionally, we suggest including experimental results comparing the impact of the regularized SCP problem and providing more motivations for each SCP formulation. Finally, addressing the identified typos and enhancing the overall presentation will significantly improve the paper's readability and impact.
