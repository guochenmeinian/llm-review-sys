Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an algorithm for extracting subgraphs from large road networks, focusing on minimizing subgraph size while ensuring near-optimal routes for predefined cost functions. The authors provide a theoretical proof of NP-hardness and establish approximation guarantees for their algorithms, which are empirically evaluated on real-world road networks, showing promising results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem addressed is significant for online navigation, providing a practical algorithmic solution.
- The theoretical foundation is robust, with clear mathematical proofs supporting the proposed algorithms.
- The writing is clear, and the results are well-presented, enhancing reader comprehension.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental evaluation is limited, lacking comprehensive data and deeper analysis; only one baseline method is compared.
- There are layout and organization issues, with methodological content misplaced in the experimental section.
- The paper does not address runtime cost evaluation, and the computational complexity of the algorithms may pose challenges in practical applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental analysis by including additional experiments and discussing the corresponding data in detail. Clarifying the organization of the paper, particularly by relocating methodological content to appropriate sections, would enhance clarity. Additionally, providing a runtime cost evaluation and discussing the time complexity of the proposed algorithms would address significant concerns. Finally, we suggest comparing the algorithms against more widely-known baselines to strengthen the empirical validation.
