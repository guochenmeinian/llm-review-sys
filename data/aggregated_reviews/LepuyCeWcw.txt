### Key Points
This paper presents a study on causal effect estimation using text data, specifically addressing selection bias by introducing an orthogonal module that disentangles covariates into treatment-related, outcome-related, and confounders. The authors propose a VAE-based framework, DIVA, and evaluate it on a new dataset of 115,880 transcripts, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The problem of causal inference from text is significant and challenging.  
2. The proposed model shows promising results and outperforms all baselines.  
3. The writing is clear and the experiments support the claimed superiority across various contexts.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The motivation for including non-confounding covariates is unclear, as it risks creating new confounders.  
2. The proposed model's focus on treatment- and outcome-related covariates may not align with the problem's emphasis on all non-confounding covariates.  
3. The orthogonal module bears similarities to prior works, limiting its technical contribution.  
4. Baselines are outdated, and some results are marginally better than these baselines.  
5. The paper lacks a thorough discussion on the assumed causal diagram and does not explore causal discovery methods for hidden variables.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for including non-confounding covariates and clarify how their approach avoids creating new confounders. Additionally, we suggest that the authors justify the novelty of their method in light of existing literature. Including evaluations under different parameter settings could enhance the robustness of the proposed method. Furthermore, addressing how the method verifies causal assumptions and relations in real-world text data would strengthen the paper. Lastly, a more comprehensive discussion on the assumed causal diagram and consideration of causal discovery methods could provide a more complete framework.
