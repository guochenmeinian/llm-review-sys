Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation suite for large vision-language models (LVLMs) and language models (LMs) in multimodal tasks, particularly focusing on image classification, visual question answering (VQA), captioning, commonsense reasoning, and embodied learning. The authors propose methods for evaluating image-text pair likelihood using a prefix-based scoring system and multi-turn reasoning techniques, emphasizing the importance of high-quality visual instruction data and the impact of model architecture on performance. The evaluation suite encompasses eight representative LVLMs and provides a repository that serves as a valuable resource for the community.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
1. The paper addresses a significant and timely evaluation problem, offering a benchmark that aids in understanding model performance and trade-offs.
2. The breadth of the evaluation set and model selection is extensive, providing numerous multimodal tasks and recent models.
3. The evaluation methodology is well-defined, employing a prefix-based score for multi-choice VQA and multi-turn reasoning to enhance accuracy.
4. The authors conducted extensive empirical studies, utilizing a diverse set of prompts to evaluate model performance.
5. Actionable insights are provided, emphasizing the significance of visual instruction data quality and multi-turn reasoning.
6. The accessible codebase enhances community utility.

**Weaknesses:**
1. Compositionality is not adequately addressed; recent benchmarks like ARO and VL-Checklist should be included.
2. The selection criteria for the models evaluated are not clearly articulated, raising questions about their representativeness.
3. The formalization of tasks and mathematical notation is lacking, particularly regarding the prefix-based score and multi-turn reasoning.
4. The evaluation methodology for image classification relies on a single prompt, which may not adequately reflect model sensitivity and fairness.
5. Some performance metrics lack clear definitions, and the sampling procedures are not sufficiently detailed, potentially undermining the benchmark's validity.
6. Certain claims made in the paper are presented as definitive conclusions rather than hypotheses, which may undermine their validity.
7. The user study's ethical considerations, such as IRB approval and methodology, are insufficiently described.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors improve the treatment of compositionality by incorporating benchmarks like ARO and VL-Checklist.
2. We suggest clarifying the model selection criteria to better justify their representativeness.
3. We urge the authors to formalize tasks with mathematical descriptions to enhance clarity, particularly for the prefix-based score and multi-turn reasoning.
4. We recommend improving the evaluation methodology in image classification by incorporating multiple prompts to ensure fairness and better assess model sensitivity.
5. We encourage the authors to provide a detailed description of performance metrics and sampling procedures to clarify their reliability and enhance transparency.
6. We advise the authors to present strong claims as hypotheses to avoid overstatement and to consolidate actionable insights and recommendations in a more localized and concise manner, ideally at the end of the introduction.
7. We encourage the authors to enhance the description of the user study, including details on IRB approval and the study's methodology.
