Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse user preferences without the need for continual retraining. The authors propose a system message protocol that allows users to specify their values, creating the MULTIFACETED COLLECTION, which consists of 192k unique combinations of values and instructions. They train a 7B parameter model, JANUS, using this dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in adhering to user preferences, outperforming several larger models in benchmarks assessing response helpfulness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The approach of using diverse system messages for alignment is innovative and scalable, avoiding the need for retraining models for each user.
2. The rigorous methodology, including comprehensive evaluations against strong baselines, enhances the validity of the results.
3. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it accessible and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
1. The construction of the MULTIFACETED COLLECTION is costly and not scalable, raising concerns about its practicality.
2. The role of system message generalization is unclear; it is not explained how varying system messages differs from using diverse instructions in user prompts.
3. Potential risks associated with flexible preference specification, such as misuse or unintended biases, are not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the scalability of the MULTIFACETED COLLECTION by exploring more efficient construction methods. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the differences between varying system messages and using different instructions in user prompts to achieve individualized alignment. It would also be beneficial to include a discussion on the potential risks of flexible preference specification and how to mitigate them. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide quantitative and qualitative analyses to investigate biases in the generated preferences and their representativeness.
