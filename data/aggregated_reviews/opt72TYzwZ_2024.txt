### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative approach to component ablation for neural network interpretability, conceptualizing a neural network as a causal graph. The authors propose *optimal ablations*, which involve setting a node's value in the computational graph to a learned constant, optimized via gradient descent, rather than using task-agnostic methods like zero or mean ablations. The authors demonstrate that optimal ablations yield improvements across various domains, including: 1. Enhanced performance in single-component ablations on the indirect object identification (IOI) task; 2. Superior results in circuit discovery through a novel method termed uniform gradient sampling (UGS); 3. Insights into factual recall, revealing that factual associations are likely stored in single layers; and 4. The introduction of the optimal constant attention (OCA) lens, which outperforms traditional methods in decoding latent predictions. Additionally, the paper discusses the categorization of information manipulation methods, specifically addressing deletion, spoofing, and the need to include "insertion." The authors propose that changing an income value should be viewed as "inserting a new value" rather than merely deletion or spoofing. They clarify the concept of optimal ablation, framing it as a method to determine the best performance achievable by a model without any distinguishing information about income, emphasizing that the term "best performance" is crucial in assessing component importance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper combines methodological advancements with extensive empirical validation, showcasing a simple yet effective idea that could significantly impact mechanistic interpretability.  
- The introduction of UGS and OCA represents novel contributions that enhance interpretability across multiple tasks.  
- The authors provide a clear and insightful discussion on the categorization of information manipulation methods, and the clarification of optimal ablation enhances the understanding of component importance.  
- The writing is clear, and the notation is well-defined, making complex ideas accessible.  

Weaknesses:  
- Some applications lack depth due to the breadth of methods explored, particularly the observations on factual recall, which could benefit from further investigation.  
- The initial omission of the "insertion" category in the discussion on information manipulation methods indicates a gap in the original analysis.  
- The explanation of optimal ablation could benefit from further precision regarding its unique contribution compared to other ablation techniques.  
- Optimal ablations still underperform compared to subtask-specific methods in certain scenarios, although the authors provide a reasonable justification for this limitation.  
- The organization of the paper is unconventional, lacking sections on related work or conclusions, which may hinder comprehension for readers unfamiliar with the topic.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the depth of analysis in applications, particularly regarding factual recall, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of their findings. Additionally, we suggest focusing on fewer case studies to allow for a more detailed exploration of each method's implications. We recommend that the authors improve the categorization of information manipulation methods by explicitly incorporating "insertion" into their analysis. Furthermore, we suggest refining their explanation of optimal ablation to clearly articulate its distinctiveness from other ablation methods, ensuring that the concept of "best performance" is emphasized throughout the paper. Clarifying the motivation and details surrounding the UGS method in the main body of the paper would enhance its impact. We also advise revising the paper's structure to include a related work section and a conclusion to better situate the contributions within the existing literature. Lastly, addressing the clarity of certain claims and ensuring the paper adheres to submission formatting guidelines, including line numbers, would strengthen the overall presentation.
