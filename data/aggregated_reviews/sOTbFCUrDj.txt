### Key Points
This paper presents a generation-based deductive (GeDe) approach for constructing a multivariate directed acyclic graph (mDAG) to solve math word problems (MWPs). The GeDe method iteratively generates an operation sequence, re-encoding inputs at each reasoning step by adding new intermediate quantities, and employs a hierarchical beam search to enhance performance. Experimental results across multiple datasets, including the newly released CMWPA dataset, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving state-of-the-art performance while addressing limitations of previous approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The GeDe approach successfully extends previous deduction methods to N-ary operators, addressing critical limitations in MWP solving.
- The introduction of a hierarchical beam search enhances model efficiency and performance.
- The paper achieves state-of-the-art results with fewer parameters and presents a clear and well-structured writing style.

Weaknesses:
- The explanation of the CMWPA dataset is insufficient and should be included in the main text rather than the appendix.
- The authors did not report the settings of random seeds or average performance across multiple experiments, which raises reproducibility concerns.
- Some evaluation results, particularly for SVAMP, are unclear and require further explanation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the CMWPA dataset description by including relevant details in the main paper. Additionally, the authors should report the settings of random seeds and average performance metrics to enhance reproducibility. Further explanations of the evaluation results, especially for SVAMP, are necessary to clarify their significance. Lastly, we suggest addressing the questions raised regarding the representation of intermediate quantities and the use of alternative methods for fair comparisons.
