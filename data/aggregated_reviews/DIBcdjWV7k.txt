Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to deep network pruning based on Ramanujan graphs, optimizing both the network's structure and weights. The authors propose two pruning strategies: pruning at initialization as graph sampling (PAGS) and pruning early as graph sampling (PEGS). The experimental results indicate that their method can outperform existing pruning algorithms, achieving state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10 with minimal pre-training costs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a logical context and is rich in theoretical analysis.
- The proposed method is technically innovative, connecting graph theory to sparse network architecture and filling an important research gap.
- Empirical results demonstrate notable performance improvements across various pruning methods.

Weaknesses:
- The suggested methods are relatively naive, with excessive length devoted to analysis and introduction.
- The experimental validation is limited to CIFAR-10/100, which does not adequately reflect the method's effectiveness; additional experiments on larger datasets like ImageNet are highly recommended.
- The clarity of the presentation is poor, with dense content and self-defined jargon making it hard to follow.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the readability of the paper by merging sections 2-4 into two concise sections focused on observation and pruning methods. Additionally, we suggest expanding the experimental section to include more datasets, particularly ImageNet, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The authors should also clarify the choice of hyperparameters and provide justifications for their selections. Lastly, we encourage the authors to refine the concept of the "Full-Spectrum Coordinate" to enhance its soundness and applicability.
