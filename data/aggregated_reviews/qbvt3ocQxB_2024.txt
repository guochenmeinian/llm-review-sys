Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for efficient instance-guided one-shot domain adaptation (IODA) aimed at addressing image super-resolution (SR) issues using only one unlabeled low-resolution (LR) image from the target domain. The authors propose an instance-guided target domain distribution expansion strategy to enhance the diversity of domain distribution, thereby improving one-shot domain adaptation performance. The methodology leverages CLIP and Alpha-CLIP to guide SR image generation and employs occlusion masks to enhance model performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of CLIP significantly enhances one-shot domain adaptation performance.
- IODA provides a novel perspective for solving SR problems, particularly in resource-constrained environments.
- The paper is well-structured, with clear expression of ideas and comprehensive ablation studies demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- The method does not appear to be the first application of CLIP for domain adaptation, as it seems to combine Alpha-CLIP with SR without sufficient novelty.
- The description of the implementation of image-guided domain adaptation and the instance-guided target domain distribution extension strategies lacks clarity and detail.
- The evaluation metrics for SR results are limited to pixel-oriented PSNR and SSIM, neglecting visual perceptual effects, and visual demonstrations are only provided in an appendix.
- The proposed method exhibits slow inference speed, taking approximately 10 minutes to generate a SR version of a single image, which raises concerns about its practical applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and detail of the methodology section, particularly regarding the implementation of image-guided domain adaptation and the instance-guided target domain distribution extension strategies. Additionally, the authors should expand the evaluation metrics to include visual perceptual effects and provide visual demonstrations in the main text. To enhance the significance of the work, we suggest comparing the SR performance against stronger baselines and addressing the limitations related to inference speed and training efficiency. Finally, a more thorough survey of existing domain adaptation methods in SR should be included to better highlight the necessity and originality of the proposed approach.
