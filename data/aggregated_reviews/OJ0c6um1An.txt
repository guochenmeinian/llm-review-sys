### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for evaluating text-to-image synthesis using multi-granularity compositionality powered by LLMs. The authors propose transforming images into whole-level and object-level visual descriptions, which are then used as prompts for LLMs to measure alignment with detailed instructions, resulting in the LLMScore. They claim that LLMScore correlates better with human judgments than traditional metrics like CLIPScore. The method addresses the limitations of existing vision-language models in capturing fine-grained details.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed evaluation framework effectively leverages LLMs to tackle the complexities of text-to-image generation.
- The rationale for evaluation adds a novel feature compared to previous works.
- The experimental procedure is robust, demonstrating significant performance improvements over standard metrics.
- The manuscript is well-organized and clearly presented.

Weaknesses:
- The authors fail to compare their method with the recent work "Mutual Information Divergence: A Unified Metric for Multimodal Generative Models" (MID), which could provide insights into the effectiveness of LLMScore.
- The significance of visual descriptors is questioned, as LLMs like GPT-4 can directly process images, potentially making the visual description step redundant.
- There is a lack of analysis regarding the robustness of the LLM evaluator against errors in visual descriptions, which could undermine the proposed method's reliability.
- The scoring criteria for human annotation need to be more specific to ensure accurate evaluations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve their comparison with the MID metric to demonstrate the effectiveness and significance of LLMScore. Additionally, consider exploring the direct use of LLMs with synthesized images instead of relying on visual descriptions, which may strengthen the argument for the necessity of visual descriptors. A systematic analysis of error accumulation in visual descriptions should be included to enhance the reliability of the proposed method. Furthermore, refining the scoring criteria for human annotation will help ensure the accuracy and trustworthiness of the evaluation results.
