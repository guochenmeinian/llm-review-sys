Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Prototype-based Aleatoric Uncertainty Quantification (PAU) framework, which aims to enhance the reliability of cross-modal retrieval methods by addressing the aleatoric uncertainty caused by low-quality data. The authors define aleatoric uncertainty in multi-modal data and propose a method that employs learnable prototypes as belief masses, utilizing Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) and Subjective Logic (SL). Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach across multiple datasets. Additionally, the authors have revised the paper to address previous comments regarding testing on noisy image-text pairs and have made several revisions to clarify their claims.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- This work is novel in combining the evidential framework with cross-modal retrieval, providing a significant contribution to the field.
- The introduction of uncertainty quantification to mitigate the impact of low-quality data is both interesting and sound, supported by extensive experimental evaluations.
- The paper is generally well-written and presents the proposed methods clearly.
- The authors demonstrate a willingness to engage with reviewer feedback and have made revisions to enhance clarity in their claims.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental details are insufficient, lacking specifics on training epochs, hyperparameter selection, and code availability.
- The differentiation of the proposed method from existing related works is unclear.
- Certain aspects of the paper are ambiguous, such as the meaning of the histogram in Figure 1(b) and the components of PAU.
- The training process for learnable parameters in the reranking process is not well-defined, and the effectiveness of prototypes in representing the overall semantic space is questionable.
- The paper does not adequately address the comparative performance of the proposed method against other state-of-the-art techniques.
- There is a lack of specific details regarding the nature of the revisions made and how they directly address the reviewers' concerns.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental setup by providing detailed information on training epochs, hyperparameter selection, and code availability. Additionally, the authors should clarify how their method differs from existing works on cross-modal retrieval and uncertainty quantification. To enhance understanding, we suggest including pseudocode for the PAU framework and addressing the ambiguous elements in the paper, such as the histogram in Figure 1(b). Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore the effects of different initialization methods for prototypes, clarify the time complexity of their algorithm, and discuss the implications of the uncertainty loss in achieving accurate uncertainty quantification. Lastly, including comparisons with more recent state-of-the-art methods and explicitly detailing how each revision addresses the reviewers' comments would strengthen the paper.
