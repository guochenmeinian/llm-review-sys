Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Bench2Drive, a benchmarking framework designed for evaluating the multiple abilities of end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) systems in a closed-loop manner. The authors aim to address the limitations of existing E2E-AD evaluation methods, which often rely on open-loop metrics or fixed route testing, by providing a more realistic and comprehensive testing environment. Bench2Drive includes 44 interactive driving scenarios across various weather conditions and locations, evaluates specific driving skills over 220 short routes, and employs a closed-loop evaluation protocol where the actions of the AD system directly influence the environment. The framework also implements several state-of-the-art E2E-AD methods, offering insights into their strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, the paper provides a detailed overview of NPC (non-player character) agent behavior in the CARLA simulation environment, highlighting three preset behavior types: cautious, normal, and aggressive. Each behavior type is governed by specific parameters such as max_speed, speed_lim_dist, and safety_time, which dictate NPC driving actions and interactions with the ego vehicle. The authors discuss the role of an expert model, Think2Drive, in data collection for training student models, emphasizing the need for privileged information in simulation scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of Bench2Drive effectively addresses the gap in autonomous driving evaluation by offering a comprehensive and realistic closed-loop benchmarking framework.
- The granular skill assessment facilitates detailed analysis of specific driving abilities, aiding targeted improvements in AD algorithms.
- Extensive coverage of diverse driving scenarios ensures thorough evaluation of AD systems, highlighting their capabilities and limitations.
- The paper provides a comprehensive breakdown of NPC behavior parameters and their implications for simulation realism.
- The discussion on the necessity of an expert model for data collection is insightful and relevant to the field.

Weaknesses:
- Bench2Drive is currently limited to the CARLA simulation environment, which may not fully capture real-world complexities.
- The reliance on simulated data could introduce biases, necessitating careful interpretation of benchmark results.
- The computational overhead of extensive evaluations is not thoroughly discussed, and the manuscript lacks detailed comparisons with existing benchmarks.
- The paper lacks clarity regarding alternative expert model choices and their open-source availability.
- There is insufficient detail on the specific scenarios used for dataset curation, which could enhance understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of potential limitations and challenges associated with the proposed benchmark, particularly regarding the gaps between simulation and real-world driving. Additional experiments on real-world datasets or simulations that closely mimic real-world conditions could further validate the robustness of Bench2Drive. 

A more in-depth analysis of the computational complexity and resource requirements for running the benchmark should be included, especially for large-scale studies. We suggest emphasizing the technical novelty of the benchmark by providing detailed comparisons with existing benchmarks and highlighting the unique advantages of Bench2Drive. 

Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the choice of the expert model by elaborating on possible alternatives, such as UniAD, and clarifying the open-source status of Think2Drive. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide more detailed references to the scenarios used in dataset curation to strengthen the manuscript's clarity and depth. 

Lastly, the quality of existing figures should be enhanced, with clearer definitions and explanations for color sections and improved font sizes. A more thorough discussion of the societal impacts and safety considerations of using Bench2Drive for evaluating AD systems would comprehensively address ethical concerns. Integrating these elements into the camera-ready version will enhance the overall quality and impact of the paper.
