### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to weakly supervised causal representation learning (CRL) that utilizes soft interventions through a causal mechanism switch variable. The authors demonstrate identifiability under specific assumptions and compare their method, ICRL-SM, against existing models like ILCM, beta-VAE, and D-VAE using synthetic and semi-synthetic image datasets. The results indicate improved performance in terms of D and C scores within the DCI framework. Additionally, the authors propose a method that builds upon existing frameworks, specifically addressing the challenges of scalability and identifiability. The discussion includes assumptions related to diffeomorphic causal mechanisms and the definition of switch variables, which are critical to the paper's theoretical foundation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method extends previous work on weakly supervised CRL by generalizing from hard to soft interventions, addressing the limitations of existing CRL methods.
- The authors provide a clear theoretical framework and proof of identifiability, contributing to the field of causal representation learning.
- The experiments conducted on datasets resembling real-world image data enhance the applicability of the proposed approach.

Weaknesses:
- The mathematical notation is poorly defined and inconsistent, making it difficult to follow. For instance, the definition of variables and functions is unclear, leading to confusion.
- The assumption of a diffeomorphic causal mechanism is strong and not commonly accepted in the literature, raising concerns about its applicability.
- The distinction between diffeomorphic causal mechanisms and diffeomorphic decoders is not adequately addressed, which could enhance the paper's rigor.
- The definition of "sufficient variability" lacks clarity and specificity, potentially confusing readers.
- The formal mathematical definition of switch variables is insufficiently detailed, omitting crucial information about their distribution and characteristics.
- The evaluation metrics used in the DCI framework are limited, as only D and C scores are reported without justification for omitting Informativeness (I).
- The synthetic experiments are conducted in a simplistic setting with limited data generating processes, which may not adequately demonstrate the method's robustness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of mathematical notation and definitions throughout the paper to enhance readability. Specifically, ensure that all variables and functions are clearly defined upon first use. We suggest revisiting the assumption of a diffeomorphic causal mechanism, considering its strength and relevance in the context of existing literature. Additionally, we recommend improving the discussion on diffeomorphic causal mechanisms to clarify their relevance and distinction from diffeomorphic decoders. Please ensure accurate citations and naming conventions for referenced works. We suggest providing a clearer definition of "sufficient variability" within the main theorem, specifying the types discussed in the referenced work. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include a more detailed formal mathematical definition of switch variables, addressing their domain and distribution. Finally, we advise expanding the synthetic experiments to include more complex data generating processes and strengthening the experimental design by conducting more comprehensive tests across various datasets to better evaluate the method's generalizability.
