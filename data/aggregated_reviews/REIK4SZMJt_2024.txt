Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper develops an analytical framework for understanding the coding of space and context in the hippocampus, characterizing how tuning width influences spatial localization and context discrimination. The authors propose that smaller tuning widths enhance spatial localization but hinder context discrimination, which may explain the gradient of tuning widths along the dorsal-ventral axis of the hippocampus. The model also predicts that place cells cluster near boundaries to support context segregation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses significant issues in systems neuroscience, elucidating the relationship between spatial and contextual coding in a novel manner, which could impact theorists in the field.
- The writing is clear and the analysis is rigorous.
- The paper generates interesting experimental predictions.

Weaknesses:
- A major concern is the mischaracterization of tuning widths along the dorsal-ventral axis; ventral cells are wider-tuned than dorsal cells, contrary to the authors' claims. Relevant literature, such as Kjelstrup et al. (2008) and others, is not adequately cited.
- The proposed selective inhibition experiments lack support from existing studies that do not consistently validate the authors' predictions.
- The paper inconsistently capitalizes "hippocampus" and contains several minor typographical errors.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the alignment of their model with existing literature, particularly regarding the dorsal-ventral axis and the tuning widths of place cells. It is crucial to cite relevant studies that contradict their claims. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify how their predictions can be experimentally tested, particularly regarding firing rate variability and the proposed confusion experiments. Explicitly describing variables in equations and ensuring clarity in figure captions would enhance the paper's comprehensibility.
