Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to the top-2 algorithm for best arm identification in multi-armed bandits, focusing on determining the optimal $\beta$ for sampling the empirical best and challenger arms. The authors propose the Anchored Top-2 (AT2) algorithm and its improved version (IAT2), leveraging fluid dynamics and the implicit function theorem to establish asymptotic optimality. The analysis shows that both algorithms achieve optimal sample complexity as $\delta \to 0$.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of a novel method for determining the optimal $\beta$ in Top-2 algorithms, supported by empirical results that demonstrate improved sample complexity and computational efficiency.
2. The use of fluid dynamics and the implicit function theorem to establish the algorithm's optimality is a unique contribution to the field of bandit problems.

Weaknesses:
1. The forced exploration stage in the AT2 algorithm raises questions about its necessity for algorithm effectiveness versus theoretical proof simplicity, potentially harming empirical performance.
2. The analyses are primarily asymptotic, which may limit applicability, and the paper's presentation is often difficult to follow, with heavy reliance on mathematical jargon without sufficient intuitive explanations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the exposition and mathematical presentation throughout the paper, particularly in Proposition 2.1, by providing more verbal explanations alongside technical statements. Additionally, consider moving the definition of $x_{1,a}$ to an earlier paragraph for better readability. We suggest including visual aids to illustrate the behavior of the paths captured by the ODEs and providing more context for the experiments to enhance understanding. Finally, addressing the role of the anchor function $g$ at a higher level could clarify its importance in learning the optimal $\beta$ and matching arm selection frequencies with optimal allocations.
