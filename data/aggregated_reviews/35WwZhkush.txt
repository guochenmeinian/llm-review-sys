Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a plug-and-play diffusion refiner for pre-trained zero-shot feed-forward monocular depth estimation (MDE) models, enabling these generalized models to capture fine-grained details. The authors propose using coarse depths from a pre-trained feed-forward MDE model as additional conditions for the diffusion refiner, which can be parameterized into existing diffusion-based MDE models. They also introduce a global pre-alignment strategy and a local patch masking strategy to enhance the accuracy of predicted depths.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-organized and clearly presented.
2. The proposed diffusion refiner is simple and can be easily integrated with various existing feed-forward MDE methods.
3. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in certain scenarios.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation for the work appears somewhat tenuous, as it suggests modifying model architecture rather than simply enriching training datasets to address low accuracy in existing methods.
2. Some statements in Table 1 are confusing regarding the training data used by existing methods, leading to potential misinterpretations.
3. The comparative evaluation shows limited improvement when the proposed method is combined with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, indicating a restricted impact on enhancing performance.
4. The novelty of the proposed method is limited, primarily revolving around the incorporation of a strong depth prior into the diffusion model, while the global pre-alignment and local patch masking strategies lack originality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of statements in Table 1 regarding the training data used by existing methods to avoid confusion. Additionally, we suggest providing a more robust justification for the motivation behind the proposed method, emphasizing how it addresses the limitations of current MDE techniques. The authors should also consider exploring the potential of using outlier-aware methods, such as RANSAC, instead of local patch masking to enhance depth map refinement. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the contribution of their method in terms of its novelty and impact on performance, particularly in comparison to existing methods.
