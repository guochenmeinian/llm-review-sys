### Key Points
This paper investigates the connection between polarity-sensitivity and degree modification, focusing on how low-degree modifiers support positive polarity items and high-degree modifiers support negative polarity items. The authors employ BERT as a learning agent to explore this relationship through an experimental setup, aiming to understand how BERT generalizes to novel tokens without prior knowledge of degree or polarity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper demonstrates a strong background in linguistic principles, making it suitable for a venue like EMNLP.
- The application of the "Artificial Language Learning" paradigm provides compelling insights into how language models handle degree modifiers and their relation to sentence polarity.
- The clear presentation of linguistic facts and the methodological setup enhances the potential for replication and extension.

Weaknesses:
- The paper's structure could be clearer, making it challenging to follow at times, particularly regarding the setup described in Section 3.
- Some methodological steps, such as introducing new tokens into BERT's vocabulary, lack adequate explanation.
- The results discussion is brief and lacks in-depth analysis, which could enrich the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper's structure to facilitate better understanding. Specifically, provide a more explicit description of how new tokens were added to BERT's vocabulary and clarify the initialization of weights for degree modifiers. Additionally, we suggest expanding the results discussion to include a more detailed analysis of findings and restructuring the paper to allow for a concise methodology description. Incorporating insights from related NLP studies would strengthen the background context. Finally, consider testing the approach on additional models to bolster the claims made in the paper.
