### Key Points
This paper presents the AFFGEN (Controlled Affective Story Generator) model aimed at enhancing story generation by introducing intriguing twists and improving emotional engagement. The authors propose two key techniques: Dynamic Beam Sizing and Affective Reranking, which aim to elevate the arousal and valence scores of generated sentences. The evaluation indicates that AFFGEN outperforms GPT-2 and GPT-3 in generating interesting and cohesive narratives. The study also highlights the effectiveness of dynamic beam sizing in improving interestingness while maintaining coherence.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a novel area in text generation, focusing on enhancing narrative interestingness.  
- The proposed methods are relatively simple yet effective, showing significant improvements over baseline models.  
- The dynamic beam sizing technique provides a surprising trade-off between coherence and interestingness.

Weaknesses:  
- The model's reliance on a five-sentence dataset raises concerns about its generalizability to longer narratives.  
- The evaluation lacks comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods beyond GPT-2 and GPT-3, and the results in Table 1 do not demonstrate significant gains.  
- Many technical details are missing, and the clarity of the contextual bandit model is insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including a broader range of baseline models to provide a more comprehensive comparison. Additionally, we suggest optimizing the prompts used for GPT-2 and GPT-3 to ensure a fairer evaluation. Clarifying the methodology behind the contextual bandit model and providing more details on the dataset used for training and evaluation would enhance reproducibility. Finally, addressing the limitations of the five-sentence structure and exploring longer narratives could strengthen the paper's contributions.
