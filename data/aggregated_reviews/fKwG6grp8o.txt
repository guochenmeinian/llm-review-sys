### Key Points
This paper presents a study of finite width corrections to the Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) for finite depth neural networks in the feature learning regime. The authors convincingly simulate properties of finite size networks, particularly modeling edge of stability behavior at large learning rates. Building on previous DMFT work, the authors analyze fluctuations around the infinite width limit, which significantly impact training dynamics in finite-sized networks. They validate their theoretical conclusions through non-synthetic experiments with CNNs trained on CIFAR10.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The authors develop a robust theoretical framework for understanding deep neural networks that incorporates finite width effects, which is a novel and powerful approach. The agreement between theory and simulations is impressive, and the paper has the potential to inform future research on neural network learning dynamics.

Weaknesses:  
The paper occasionally lacks depth, covering multiple applications without sufficient detail due to page limits. Understanding the DMFT requires familiarity with prior work, and the sparse review section may hinder comprehension. Additionally, the reliance on physics terminology may limit accessibility for a broader audience.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the DMFT equations and their numerical implementation. Specifically, provide more intuitions about how the DMFT equations are solved and clarify the role of the propagator $\Sigma$. We suggest including a more detailed discussion on the significance of Eqn (3) and the next order term's size. Addressing the computational complexity of solving DMFT equations and the dataset size used for CIFAR10 experiments would enhance understanding. We also encourage the authors to create a "translation guide" for readers unfamiliar with physics jargon. Lastly, consider expanding the review section to better contextualize the paper's contributions and dependencies on prior work.
