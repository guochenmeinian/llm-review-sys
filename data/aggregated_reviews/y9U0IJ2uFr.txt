### Key Points
This paper presents a new dimensionality reduction algorithm, SNEkhorn, which addresses the limitations of existing symmetrization methods for entropic affinities (EAs) by employing optimal transport (OT). The authors derive EAs that maintain symmetric doubly stochastic normalization and fixed row-wise entropy, leading to a robust and efficient dual ascent algorithm for computing these affinities. The effectiveness of SNEkhorn is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments on both simulated and real datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method effectively symmetrizes EAs while preserving their properties, providing a novel and straightforward approach.
- The discovery of connections between EAs and OT offers a fresh perspective on dimensionality reduction.
- The proposed algorithm avoids the spherical constraints typically imposed by conventional methods, enhancing flexibility in the embedding space.
- Comprehensive evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets illustrate the algorithm's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a discussion on the computational complexity of the proposed method compared to t-SNE and UMAP, which is crucial for practical applications.
- Some formulas and references are incorrectly hyperlinked, potentially confusing readers.
- The presentation is dense, making it challenging to digest, and the notation can be unconventional and difficult to follow.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by providing intuitive explanations and illustrative examples for complex concepts like entropic affinities and optimal transport. Additionally, a thorough analysis of the computational complexity of SNEkhorn compared to t-SNE and UMAP should be included to address practical concerns. We suggest expanding the experiments to include broader comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods to strengthen the claims regarding the necessity of Sinkhorn symmetrization. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis on the hyperparameters introduced by the new symmetrization approach would enhance the robustness assessment of the SNEkhorn algorithm.
