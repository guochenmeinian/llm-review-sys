Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CaPaint, a causal structure plugin for spatio-temporal (ST) forecasting that identifies causal regions in data to enhance causal reasoning. The authors propose a two-stage process, utilizing a novel image inpainting technique with a fine-tuned unconditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), which fills gaps identified as environmental parts, thereby improving model generalizability and interpretability. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through experiments on multiple datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with clear explanations and effective use of figures to illustrate the model's mechanisms and results.
- It introduces an interesting concept by integrating causal inference into spatio-temporal data analysis, particularly through generative models.
- Experiments are thoroughly conducted across five datasets, yielding promising results.

Weaknesses:
- The abstract contains a typo, incorrectly referring to front-door adjustment as back-door adjustment.
- There is a lack of detailed descriptions on how generated spatio-temporal data are synthesized into coherent ST sequences, missing crucial methodological details.
- The paper does not clearly demonstrate improvements in the quality and efficiency of generation, necessitating additional experiments to substantiate these aspects.
- The novelty of the proposed method is somewhat limited, as it builds on previously introduced concepts without significant advancements.
- The evaluations use the same datasets as prior work, which may not fairly highlight improvements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the abstract by correcting the typo regarding the adjustment terminology. Additionally, the authors should provide detailed descriptions of the synthesis process for spatio-temporal data and include more experiments to demonstrate the quality and efficiency of their generation method. To enhance the novelty aspect, we suggest that the authors directly compare their results with those of NuwaDynamics using the same settings. Furthermore, including clearer visualizations of finer details in figures and additional visualizations of prediction results would improve the paper's comprehensibility.
