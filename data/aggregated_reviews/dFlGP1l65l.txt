### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of news media storms, defined as periods of intensified coverage on specific events, and proposes a model based on article similarity to identify these storms, successfully identifying 98 instances over 21 months. The authors utilize the NELA corpus and a bi-encoder Neural Network model to train an article-similarity model, which is then applied to analyze various aspects of media storms, including their duration, outlet participation, development patterns, and topic distributions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides an in-depth qualitative and quantitative analysis of media storms, aligning with existing literature.
- The dataset created is extensive and can serve as a valuable resource for future research.
- The authors present a clear methodology for extracting media storms from news articles.

Weaknesses:
- The analysis primarily focuses on identifying and describing media storms without applying the dataset to downstream tasks, limiting its contribution.
- Concerns arise regarding the selection of article segments for similarity computation, which may overlook important semantic content.
- The paper lacks novel methods or conclusions, with many findings being predictable based on the definition of media storms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by incorporating results from downstream tasks using the media storms data, such as predicting the onset and duration of media storms or identifying user involvement. Additionally, we suggest providing more depth regarding the rationale behind the selection of article segments for similarity computation and clarifying the criteria for defining media storms. Exploring subclusters among storm types could enhance understanding, and addressing the ambiguities in Table 1 and Figure 5 would improve clarity.
