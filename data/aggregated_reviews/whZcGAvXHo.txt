### Key Points
This paper presents a study of networked public goods games involving heterogeneous players with concave utility functions and convex cost functions. The authors establish the existence of Nash Equilibrium (NE) and provide conditions for its uniqueness, utilizing Brouwerâ€™s fixed point theorem. They introduce the concept of game equivalence, allowing transformations between public goods games while maintaining the relationships between their Nash equilibria. The paper also includes a case study analyzing how small changes in model parameters affect player utilities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is the first to explore public goods games with convex costs, extending previous linear cost models and providing a comprehensive analysis of NE existence and uniqueness.  
- It is well-written and presents a thorough examination of the conditions for unique NE, offering clear intuitions behind these conditions.  
- The results are technically solid and contribute significantly to the literature on networked public goods games.

Weaknesses:  
- The motivation for the concave utility function is not clearly articulated, which raises questions about its necessity beyond ensuring the continuity of the best-response function.  
- The case study's takeaway message is unclear, particularly regarding the significance of Theorem 4.2 in the broader context of public goods games.  
- The paper could benefit from additional results, such as the price of anarchy and structural insights in the non-linear setting.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for the concave utility function to enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest that the authors elaborate on the implications of their results for policy design, particularly how the existence and uniqueness of NE relate to real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include a discussion on the price of anarchy and stability in their model, as well as to clarify the significance of Theorem 4.2 in the case study. Lastly, addressing the minor comments and questions raised in the reviews would strengthen the paper's overall quality.
