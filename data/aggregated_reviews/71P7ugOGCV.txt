Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical investigation into the divergence phenomenon in Q-value iteration methods, particularly in offline reinforcement learning (RL). The authors introduce a framework based on the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) to predict divergence and identify the training steps at which it occurs. They propose a new metric, SEEM, to measure self-excitation and demonstrate that regularizing this metric can mitigate divergence. The authors find that LayerNorm is the most effective regularization method among those tested, leading to stable training and improved performance in offline RL scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The regularization perspective is novel and allows for the use of standard deep learning techniques without introducing policy constraints that can cause bias.
- The theoretical insights provided by the theorems are beneficial, although their proofs require verification.
- The experiments convincingly demonstrate that SEEM is a significant indicator of divergence and that LayerNorm effectively stabilizes Q estimates.

Weaknesses:
- A brief description of the offline RL methods used would enhance clarity, as the paper does not adequately discuss policy constraints.
- The paper lacks proper references to prior work, particularly regarding the dynamics of Q-learning in offline RL and the application of LayerNorm.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the exposition by including a concise description of the offline RL methods utilized, particularly those involving policy constraints. Additionally, it would be beneficial to conduct an ablation study to assess the impact of techniques such as EMA and double Q-learning on performance. Clarifying whether the results in Fig. 9 incorporate EMA would also strengthen the analysis. Furthermore, the authors should ensure that the paper undergoes thorough editing for grammatical accuracy and clarity, particularly in sections discussing the BC term and experimental results. Lastly, explicit references to prior work and clearer connections to existing literature should be established to enhance the paper's credibility.
