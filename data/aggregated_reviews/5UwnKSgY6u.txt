Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for evaluating the robustness of explanations in machine learning models through the concepts of explanation invariance and equivariance, utilizing geometric deep learning formalism. The authors introduce two metrics, invariance and equivariance scores, for empirically assessing explanation robustness across various interpretability methods and modalities. The paper also derives theoretical robustness guarantees for popular interpretability methods and provides five actionable guidelines to enhance robustness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses an important and novel research question regarding the robustness of interpretability methods against input transformations, extending the evaluation to various explanation types and modalities.
2. The introduction of a systematic approach to measure robustness through theoretical guarantees and extensive experiments is commendable, leading to practical guidelines for improving robustness.

Weaknesses:
1. The organization of the paper does not align well with the contributions outlined in the abstract, potentially confusing readers.
2. Important details regarding the results in Table 1 are not discussed in the main text, and the mathematical proofs are relegated to the appendix, which may hinder clarity.
3. The experimental section lacks clarity regarding the application of the Dihedral Group to the datasets, and the specific transformations applied are not exemplified.
4. The paper's focus on perfectly invariant models limits its applicability, as many real-world models are only approximately invariant or equivariant.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper's organization to better reflect the contributions stated in the abstract. Additionally, including discussions of the results in Table 1 within the main text would enhance clarity. Providing specific examples of the transformations applied in the context of the Dihedral Group would also be beneficial. Furthermore, the authors should consider extending their framework to accommodate models that are not perfectly invariant, as this would broaden the applicability of their proposed methods.
