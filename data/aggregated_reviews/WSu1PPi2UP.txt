Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for prompting LLMs to generate content that optimizes an objective defined in a latent space through externally provided embedding spaces. The authors propose a reinforcement learning agent, EAGLE, which prompts an LLM to generate textual actions that modify an entity, such as a movie description. The method is evaluated using the MovieLens 25M dataset, demonstrating that the RL agent significantly aids in discovering novel movies that users prefer.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed solution addresses a relevant problem for the NeurIPS community and is considered novel.
- The rigorous evaluation indicates that the method is effective within the evaluated domain.
- The paper is largely well-written, although some details require clarification.

Weaknesses:
- Clarity could be improved, particularly regarding the purpose of the reference distribution and the intuition behind the G-optimal design.
- The evaluation is limited to a single use case, raising questions about the method's generalizability and the need for case-specific tuning.
- The presentation is overly mathematical, making it challenging to understand the experimental details.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity on the purpose of the reference policy and the G-optimal design, as well as provide a more intuitive explanation of their significance. Additionally, expanding the evaluation to include multiple use cases would enhance the generalizability of the findings. We suggest simplifying the mathematical presentation and ensuring that the main text is as informative as the appendix. Finally, addressing the potential biases introduced by personalized actions and exploring the coverage of the latent embedding space would strengthen the paper's contributions.
