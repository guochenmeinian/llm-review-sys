Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents new methods for counting the number of linear regions in neural networks through the lens of tropical Puiseux rational maps. By calculating the Hoffman constant, the authors identify a sampling radius that guarantees intersection with all linear regions of the network. They propose algorithms for counting linear regions in both invariant and traditional networks, while also releasing an open-source library for analysis. Additionally, the authors clarify their use of arbitrary group actions and permutation invariant neural networks, emphasizing their approach to defining these actions. They assert that their work builds on concepts from tropical geometry, particularly in relation to neural networks and their expressivity, and they acknowledge the importance of the Hoffman constant in their numerical methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with clear presentation and minimal errors.
- The authors provide a clear theoretical foundation for their methods, demonstrating the feasibility of symbolic computation techniques in neural networks.
- They introduce an effective sampling domain based on the Hoffman constant, enhancing computational efficiency.
- The integration of tropical geometry concepts is well-articulated, contributing to the understanding of neural network expressivity.
- The authors demonstrate a commitment to refining their work based on reviewer feedback.

Weaknesses:
- The connections to tropical geometry and group theory lack rigor, with significant issues in the definitions and applications of these concepts.
- The motivation for the work is unclear, failing to articulate how it fills gaps in existing literature on linear region counting.
- The practical utility of the proposed methods on larger networks remains unclear, with concerns about the efficiency and scalability of the code.
- The utility of the proposed methods is not convincingly demonstrated, particularly as experiments show divergence in larger input sizes and deeper networks.
- There is a lack of clarity regarding the necessity of tropical geometry in their approach, as some reviewers argue that the work could be conducted without it.
- The authors have not sufficiently addressed the attribution of prior work in the intersection of tropical geometry and machine learning.
- The computational complexity is prohibitive, with no asymptotic analysis provided for the sampling methods.
- The length of sections dedicated to different topics may lead to an imbalance in perceived importance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the rigor of their connections to tropical geometry and group theory, ensuring that definitions and applications are clearly articulated and correctly applied. Additionally, clarifying the motivation for the work and its contributions to existing literature would strengthen the paper. We suggest providing a more thorough demonstration of the utility of the methods, particularly in the context of larger input sizes and deeper networks. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their discussion regarding the necessity of tropical geometry, potentially by providing a more explicit rationale for its inclusion in their methods. Enhancing the efficiency of their algorithms and providing more extensive experiments on larger network architectures to demonstrate scalability would also be beneficial. It would be advantageous to include a more comprehensive review of related literature to strengthen the attribution of prior work in the field. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the definitions and roles of group actions and representations in their framework to avoid confusion and to consider the balance of content across sections to better reflect the significance of each contribution.
