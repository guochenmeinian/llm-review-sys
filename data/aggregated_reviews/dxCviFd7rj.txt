### Key Points
This paper presents a Target-oriented multimodal sentiment classification task and proposes a Visual Elements Mining as Prompts (VEMP) model to enhance sentiment classification by incorporating text symbols from images and target-aware adjective-noun pairs (TANPs). The authors argue that these elements, combined with image captions, improve instruction tuning of a language-only model, achieving state-of-the-art results on two datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach of extracting additional information (OCR and TANPs) from images is innovative and potentially enhances sentiment classification.
- The paper is well-written and presents an intuitive method.
- The results demonstrate effectiveness, with better performance compared to several baselines.

Weaknesses:
- The model framework lacks novelty, relying heavily on existing models without clear justification for their selection.
- Many critical experimental design choices are inadequately explained, raising concerns about the validity of comparisons with baselines.
- The use of T5 as the text encoder may lead to unfair comparisons with models like BERT used in baseline networks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their experimental design by providing detailed explanations of how baseline models were trained and the hyperparameter settings for their proposed approach. Additionally, we suggest addressing the potential limitations of the text extraction method, particularly regarding how bounding boxes are selected, to ensure complete context is captured. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify which specific models of ChatGPT were used and to consider incorporating strategies like Chain of Thought prompting to enhance the assessment of their model's performance. Lastly, we advise the authors to refine their ethics statement to address biases in image captioning and the availability of datasets used in their study.
