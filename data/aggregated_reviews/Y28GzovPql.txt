### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive database of cognate pairs and borrowings for five Romance languages, significantly larger than previous databases. The authors aim to contribute to both historical and computational linguistics by providing a benchmark for automatic cognate detection. The methodology involves extracting cognate pairs from electronic dictionaries using machine learning techniques, and the results are promising for future research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-documented and clearly written, with a thorough literature review.
- It introduces a substantial resource for historical linguistics and computational tasks.
- The experimental setup is carefully executed, and the human-on-the-loop process ensures data quality.
- The methodology and findings are presented clearly, with meaningful comparisons to similar databases.

Weaknesses:
- Some concerns were raised regarding the removal of special characters that indicate pronunciation, which may affect comparative analysis.
- The discussion on the 'broadened' definition of cognates raises questions about the paper's alignment with its stated goals.
- Clarifications are needed regarding the accuracy of grapheme to phoneme conversion and specific examples provided in the text.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definitions of cognate pairs and borrowings, particularly regarding historical derivatives. Additionally, addressing the accuracy of the eSpeak library for grapheme to phoneme conversion is essential. It would be beneficial to include more details on the pipeline described in Section 2 and 2.1 to elucidate crucial decisions made during database construction. Lastly, consider providing a more thorough discussion on how the models perform with lexically divergent cognate pairs, particularly function words.
