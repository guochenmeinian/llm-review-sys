Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for open-set fine-grained retrieval through the Visual Attribute Parameterization Network (VAPNet), which learns visual attributes from known categories and parameterizes them into the retrieval model. The authors propose a method that extracts and refines attributes in an unsupervised manner, utilizing local image patches to distill visual attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VAPNet achieves state-of-the-art performance across three datasets, showing an average accuracy gain of 8.6% compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of visual attributes to open-set fine-grained retrieval is commendable and innovative.
- The manuscript is well-written and presents a clear methodology.
- The proposed method shows promising retrieval improvements on datasets like CUB and Cars.

Weaknesses:
- The necessity of introducing visual attributes into open-set fine-grained retrieval is not adequately explained.
- The architectural choices in Section 3 are difficult to follow, and the differences between training and evaluation pipelines are not clearly stated.
- The attribute exploration module focuses solely on local attributes, neglecting global attributes, which could enhance the model's performance.
- There are several errors and unclear concepts throughout the paper, including mislabeling in equations and ambiguous terminology.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 3 by referencing Figure 2 more effectively to guide readers through the architectural choices. Additionally, explicitly stating the differences between training and evaluation pipelines would enhance understanding. The authors should consider incorporating global attributes into the attribute exploration module to strengthen their approach. Furthermore, addressing the errors in the manuscript, such as the mislabeling of equations and clarifying ambiguous terms, will improve the overall quality of the paper. Lastly, a discussion on the computational implications of the attribute extraction model should be included to provide a comprehensive view of the method's limitations.
