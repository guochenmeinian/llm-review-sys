### Key Points
This paper presents a generative approach for key-value extraction from document images, utilizing an encoder-decoder transformer to directly generate text, thereby addressing OCR errors. The authors propose a multimodal representation that fuses image and text, aiming to enhance performance over traditional OCR-followed-by-NER methods. Experimental results indicate that the approach achieves competitive performance on multiple datasets, demonstrating robustness to OCR noise.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The generative approach is theoretically capable of addressing OCR errors effectively.  
- The multimodal representation is innovative and contributes to advancing the field.  
- The method reduces the need for costly token-level annotations, potentially lowering annotation costs.  
- The paper provides a detailed explanation of methodology and prompts, enhancing clarity.

Weaknesses:  
- The overall end-to-end accuracy is lower than previous methods, raising concerns about practical effectiveness.  
- The test set sizes are small, leading to potential volatility in results.  
- The robustness experiments may be overly harsh on token-classification models, lacking ideal comparative scenarios.  
- The novelty of the encoder-decoder approach is questioned, as similar methods exist without clear differentiation.  
- The evaluation does not include the vanilla OFA performance, leaving uncertainty about the effectiveness of introduced features.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the robustness experiments by comparing the performance of their model using imperfect OCR text against manually corrected text. Additionally, clarifying the types of OCR noises added in the ablation studies would enhance reproducibility. The authors should also consider including the vanilla OFA performance in their evaluation to better contextualize their contributions. Finally, addressing the limitations of existing methods more explicitly and detailing specific innovations made on top of OFA would strengthen the paper's claims.
