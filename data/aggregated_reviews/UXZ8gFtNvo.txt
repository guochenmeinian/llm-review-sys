### Key Points
This paper presents a Deep Signed Graph Clustering (DSGC) approach that addresses the limitations of traditional signed graph clustering methods, particularly their sensitivity to noise and reliance on Social Balance Theory. The authors propose two mechanisms: Violation Sign-Refine (VS-R) for sign correction and Density-Based Augmentation to enhance positive edge density within clusters. A signed graph convolutional network is employed to learn node embeddings based on Weak Balance Theory, followed by clustering through an optimization process aimed at minimizing violations. The method is evaluated on synthetic and real datasets, showing solid performance compared to existing alternatives.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces innovative preprocessing techniques (VS-R and Density-Based Augmentation) that enhance clustering performance.
- The framework is empirically validated with extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets.
- The writing is clear, and the use of figures aids in understanding the concepts.

Weaknesses:
- The technical contributions lack significant differentiation from existing methods, which should be more explicitly highlighted.
- The evaluation of real datasets is not convincing, with limited metrics and visual assessments.
- Some concepts, such as high-order neighbor information, are not adequately explained, leading to potential misunderstandings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definitions and motivations for their methods, particularly regarding high-order neighbor information and the rationale behind the choice of walks with exactly one negative edge. The authors should also clarify the relationship between cycles with multiple negative ties and their implications for balance theory. Additionally, we suggest including more relevant methods designed for signed graphs in the evaluation to provide a comprehensive comparison. The paper should be carefully proofread to correct typos and improve figure captions for clarity. Finally, we encourage the authors to analyze the scalability of their method and include standard metrics for unlabeled clustering to strengthen the evaluation of real datasets.
