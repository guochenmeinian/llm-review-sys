Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the causes of activation quantization performance issues in GLU-based large language models (LLMs) and proposes two methods, Quantization-free Module (QFeM) and Quantization-free Prefix (QFeP), to mitigate activation spikes. The authors analyze the relationship between attention spikes and Gated Linear Units (GLU) and present experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of their methods in improving quantization performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The analysis of attention spikes is thorough and comprehensive.
2. The identification of activation spikes in GLU-based LLMs is novel and insightful.
3. The paper is well-structured and clear, making it mostly easy to understand.

Weaknesses:
1. The proposed QFeM method is not hardware-friendly, as it maintains some modules at high precision and cannot utilize low-bit INT General Matrix Multiply (GEMM) directly.
2. The QFeP method resembles the previously researched IntactKV method but lacks a detailed comparative discussion.
3. The experimental settings are limited to W8A8 configurations, neglecting other quantization settings like W4A4 and W4A8.
4. The paper does not include comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines such as OmniQuant, AffineQuant, QLLM, and QuaRot.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the hardware compatibility of the QFeM method to facilitate low-bit operations. Additionally, we suggest providing a detailed analysis highlighting the differences between the QFeP method and IntactKV. Expanding the experimental results to include different quantization settings, such as W4A4 and W4A8, would enhance the paper's contribution. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines and conduct ablation tests as outlined in Table 4 to strengthen their findings.
