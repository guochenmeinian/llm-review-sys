### Key Points
This paper presents VRSBench, a benchmark dataset designed to enhance vision-language models for remote sensing images. It comprises approximately 30K to 50K manually verified remote sensing images, supporting various tasks such as image captioning, visual grounding, and visual question answering. The dataset is notable for its detailed human-verified annotations and thorough documentation, which facilitate its use in future research. The authors evaluate state-of-the-art models on this dataset, establishing its relevance and impact in the field.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. VRSBench provides high-quality, human-verified annotations, ensuring the dataset's utility for real applications.
2. The dataset supports multiple vision-language tasks, promoting the development of versatile models.
3. The paper includes a benchmark evaluation of existing models, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. The dataset is limited to RGB images, restricting its applicability to other remote sensing modalities like infrared and SAR images.
2. The evaluation primarily focuses on similar MLLM models, suggesting a need for a broader range of models to enrich the evaluation.
3. The limitations of the dataset, particularly regarding the automatic steps in its creation and the biases introduced by the use of GPT-4V, are not adequately discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including a wider range of models to provide a richer criterion. Additionally, clarifying the extent of human corrections during the dataset creation process would enhance transparency. The authors should also consider expanding the dataset to include other types of remote sensing images beyond RGB. A deeper analysis of model performance on specific tasks and the biases generated from the automatic pipeline would be beneficial. Furthermore, specifying the GPU model used in the experiments and clarifying the definition of "open-set" in the context of the study would improve the paper's clarity.
