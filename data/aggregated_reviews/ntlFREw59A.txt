Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ActAnywhere, a video diffusion model aimed at generating realistic video backgrounds that adapt to the motion of a foreground subject. The model utilizes a sequence of foreground segmentation and a background image to produce coherent interactions between the foreground and background. The authors employ a latent video diffusion model, integrating encoded foreground appearances and masks with a conditioning image encoded via CLIP, facilitating cross-attention to the U-net. The paper includes qualitative results showcasing plausible scene generation and quantitative evaluations through ablation studies and human rater comparisons.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces a novel problem of automated subject-aware video background generation, demonstrating significant improvements in coherent video generation with realistic interactions.  
- The methodology is comprehensive, and the paper is well-written, with visually appealing results across various foreground subjects.  

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty of the approach is limited, primarily differing from existing methods by inverting masks rather than presenting substantial innovations.  
- The reliance on the quality of foreground segmentation masks raises concerns about the model's robustness.  
- Comparisons with a broader range of existing methods are insufficient, particularly those leveraging recent advancements in video generation.  
- The training resolution is low (256x256), and the implications for high-resolution performance are unclear.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their contributions by exploring additional innovative techniques beyond mask inversion. It would be beneficial to conduct unconditional generation experiments to assess the model's ability to create plausible backgrounds without explicit guidance. Additionally, we suggest providing more comprehensive comparisons with a wider array of existing methods, particularly those relevant to video generation and editing. Clarifying the training details, especially regarding the fine-tuning of spatial and motion modules, would enhance the paper's rigor. Finally, including video demos to illustrate the model's performance and addressing potential boundary blurriness would strengthen the presentation.
