Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method to bridge domain gaps among various LiDAR datasets, facilitating zero-shot detection on new datasets. The authors propose Scene Modeling for foreground and background reconstruction and LiDAR Modeling using statistical and ray-drop modeling. Additionally, they accelerate the ray casting algorithm via GPU. The method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on Waymo, nuScenes, and KITTI datasets, supported by ablation studies on foreground diversity and LiDAR noise injection. The submission titled LiT has undergone revisions based on reviewer feedback, incorporating MMD and JSD metrics to directly evaluate translation quality, thereby enhancing the robustness of their work. The authors express eagerness to receive further thoughts on whether the revisions adequately address the highlighted issues and to discuss any additional questions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The originality of the foreground and background reconstruction and the innovative LiDAR Modeling distinguishes this work from prior research.
- The provision of code and comprehensive evaluations across multiple datasets, achieving SOTA performance, enhances the paper's quality.
- Clarity is evident in the images and explanations throughout the paper.
- The addition of relevant metrics (MMD and JSD) improves the evaluation of translation quality.
- The revisions and additional experiments have enhanced the persuasiveness and completeness of the work.

Weaknesses:
- The title's use of terms like "Language," "Translator," and "LiT" may mislead readers by capitalizing on trending terminology.
- The reliance on older detection models such as SECOND and PV-RCNN limits the demonstration of domain unification's impact; newer models like CenterPoint should be included for a more robust analysis.
- The analysis of scene reconstruction and the implications of foreground and background modeling require further depth.
- The authors seek confirmation on whether the changes sufficiently address the reviewers' concerns, indicating potential uncertainty about the adequacy of their revisions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the title to avoid potential misconceptions regarding its terminology. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments with more recent models, such as CenterPoint, to better illustrate the effects of domain unification and potentially achieve new SOTA results. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to enhance the discussion on scene reconstruction and the modeling of foreground and background components to address the limitations identified in the reviews. Lastly, we recommend that the authors clarify how the newly added metrics specifically enhance the evaluation process and provide a more detailed discussion on how the revisions address each of the reviewers' concerns to strengthen the overall argument.
