Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents "PowerGraph," a benchmark dataset specifically designed for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in power grid applications, addressing the scarcity of publicly available datasets for training and benchmarking machine learning models in this domain. PowerGraph includes datasets for power flow, optimal power flow, and cascading failure analyses, along with ground-truth explanations for cascading failures. The authors benchmark various GNN methods for both node-level and graph-level tasks, providing a comprehensive evaluation of their performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of the PowerGraph dataset fills a significant gap in the availability of high-quality datasets for GNN applications in power grid analysis.
- The extensive benchmarking of GNN architectures on relevant tasks (power flow, optimal power flow, cascading failures) is thorough and well-executed.
- The inclusion of ground-truth explanations enhances the interpretability of GNN models, contributing to the development of explainable AI methods in power systems.

Weaknesses:
- The paper does not clearly articulate the limitations of existing power grid datasets that PowerGraph aims to address, particularly regarding widely studied systems like IEEE-118.
- The performance analysis is insufficient, showcasing only the best results without providing a comprehensive view of all models tested.
- The innovation in explainability is limited, and the dataset may lack sufficient complexity for benchmarking advanced models, as indicated by the relatively high test accuracy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the articulation of the gaps in existing power grid datasets, specifically highlighting how PowerGraph addresses these issues. Additionally, the authors should include a more comprehensive performance analysis by presenting results for all models tested in the appendix. To enhance the dataset's complexity, consider introducing more confounders and randomness in the data generation process. Furthermore, we suggest including baseline models, such as gradient boosted trees, to provide a clearer assessment of GNN advantages. Lastly, a discussion on the relevance of long-range dependencies in cascading failures should be included to strengthen the dataset's applicability to real-world scenarios.
