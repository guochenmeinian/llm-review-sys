### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the effects of grounding—providing models with richer data than just text—on the linguistic abilities of language models. The authors compare single-task, multi-task, and multi-modal models, finding that multi-modal models exhibit stronger agreement and better capture word concreteness. The study aims to clarify how different types of grounding influence model behavior through various experimental setups.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The comparison of single-task, multi-task, and multi-modal models while controlling for accuracy is a valuable contribution.
- Careful construction of candidate models through varied training epochs and noise addition demonstrates thoroughness.
- Follow-up analyses, including attention weight analysis, enhance understanding of qualitative differences.

Weaknesses:
- Definitions of "weak" and "strong" grounding are too loose, lacking rigorous clarity.
- The conceptualization of grounding effects in two opposing experiments (agreement vs. concreteness) is confusing.
- Concreteness is treated dichotomously, which may not adequately reflect its continuous nature.
- Visualizations, particularly in Figure 2, lack clarity, and the rationale for using density plots is questionable.
- Missing details on model implementation and parameter specifications hinder reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the definitions of "weak" and "strong" grounding to provide a more rigorous framework. Clarifying the conceptual differences between the two experiments would enhance coherence. We suggest avoiding the dichotomization of concreteness and instead addressing it as a continuous dimension. Additionally, clearer visualizations in Figure 2, including grouped line patterns and labeled axes in Figure 3, would aid interpretation. Finally, providing more detailed information about model parameters and implementation would bolster reproducibility.
