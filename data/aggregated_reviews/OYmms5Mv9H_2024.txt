Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel diffusion-based generative model for modeling complex 3D geometric structures with time-evolving trajectories, introducing the SE(3) equivariance property, temporal attention, and a learnable geometric prior into the discretized diffusion model. The proposed model achieves high performance in learning geometric trajectory distributions while maintaining symmetry, with potential for conditional generation through an equivariant cross-attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in applications such as molecular dynamics and simulation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction and methods are well-written and clear.
2. The approach to processing time sequence information is reasonable, well-defined, and novel, supported by sufficient proof and analysis in the appendix.
3. Detailed explanation and analysis of conditional generation are provided.
4. The experimental setup and results are extensive and detailed.
5. Clear ablation studies validate the methodology.

Weaknesses:
1. Speed and efficiency remain limitations of the proposed model, raising concerns about redesigning the framework into continuous diffusion ODE/SDE forms for acceleration.
2. A more detailed comparison with the E(3) Equivariant Diffusion Model is needed.
3. The importance of geometric restrictions in N-body simulations and the definition of 'geometric structure' require further clarification.
4. The practical utility of short molecular trajectories, as visualized, is questioned.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the model's speed and efficiency by exploring the redesign of the framework into continuous diffusion ODE/SDE forms. Additionally, the authors should provide a more comprehensive comparison of the proposed EGTN/EGCL with the E(3) Equivariant Diffusion Model. It would be beneficial to elaborate on the significance of geometric restrictions in N-body simulations and clarify the concept of 'geometric structure' in these contexts. Finally, the authors should address the practical implications of the observed small changes in molecular structure and the utility of short trajectories in real-world applications.
