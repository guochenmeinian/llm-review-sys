Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the phenomenon of sound symbolism, specifically the kiki-bouba effect, within vision-and-language models CLIP and Stable Diffusion. The authors explore whether these models exhibit consistent associations between phonetics and visual representations of sharp and round objects, using a dataset of pseudowords. The study concludes that both models demonstrate sound symbolism, paralleling human tendencies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well written and provides a clear explanation of motivation, methodology, and experimental results.
- The methods used to investigate sound symbolism are valid, and the observed effect is strong.
- The work includes thorough discussions of experimental results and offers rich supplementary material.
- Human evaluations support the automatic metrics, enhancing the study's credibility.

Weaknesses:
- The study is limited to open-sourced models CLIP and Stable Diffusion, which may restrict generalizability; exploring models with different architectures like GANs or ViTs could strengthen the findings.
- The **zero-shot knowledge probing** method lacks comparison with baseline methods, such as training classifiers for text-text and text-image scores.
- The motivations and implications for studying sound symbolism in these models are underexplored, and the authors do not present hypotheses based on model training.
- The user study's analysis is insufficiently detailed, and the statistical methods employed are not appropriate for the data structure.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the motivations and implications of their study in the context of Cognitive Science, explicitly addressing how these models can provide insights into sound symbolism. Additionally, we suggest including hypotheses derived from the models' training data and exploring sound symbolism in multiple languages to enhance the study's breadth. The authors should also clarify the methodology and participant details in the user study, ensuring ethical considerations are adequately addressed. Finally, we encourage the authors to adopt more appropriate statistical analyses, such as mixed-effects models, to better account for participant variability.
