### Key Points
This paper presents CAGE, an end-to-end category tree generation framework utilizing differentiable vector quantization for ID-based recommendation. The method allows for simultaneous learning and refinement of categorical code representations and entity embeddings, demonstrating adaptability across various recommendation tasks such as List Completion, Click-Through Rate, and Collaborative Filtering. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CAGE across multiple datasets and baseline models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The narrative and explanations are well-crafted, ensuring clarity.
- CAGE exhibits adaptability to various recommendation tasks and compatibility with diverse methods.
- The empirical validation of the method is robust, with detailed ablation studies indicating performance improvements with increased layers and entries.

Weaknesses:
- Certain mathematical expressions and terms, such as "z" and "q," lack clarity and definition, making them difficult to understand.
- The connection between Tree Generation and Vector Quantization is ambiguous, and the rationale for using Vector Quantization granularity is unclear.
- The paper does not provide sufficient implementation details for reproducibility, and the choice of datasets raises questions regarding their appropriateness for the tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of mathematical expressions by defining all symbols upon their first use. Additionally, a deeper analysis of the integration of the proposed module's efficiency on large-scale datasets is necessary. To enhance the paper's comprehensibility, we suggest elucidating the relationship between Tree Generation and Vector Quantization. We also advise conducting experiments to validate that CAGE captures real category information and to explore the compatibility of CAGE's category encoding across different architectures. Lastly, including an "Improvement" column in Table 2 for non-FANS models and providing insights into standard deviation and p-values would strengthen the statistical robustness of the findings.
