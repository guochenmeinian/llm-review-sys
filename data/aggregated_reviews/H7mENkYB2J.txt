Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for estimating transition matrices from multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) using a phylogenetic tree model parameterized by the transition matrix and site rates. The authors propose FastCherry, which simplifies composite likelihood estimation by eliminating tree construction and focusing on disjoint pairs of similar sequences. FastCherry extends the WAG phylogenetic model by incorporating per-site transition matrices, estimated via maximum likelihood. The authors demonstrate the method's significance through speedup comparisons with CherryML and variant prediction performance against baseline approaches like ESM-1v and ESM-IF1.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed methods are significantly faster than existing methods and scalable for large MSAs while maintaining high accuracy.
- The methods outperform large protein language models in variant effect prediction, particularly in GPU resource efficiency.
- The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of technical points relevant to protein science.

Weaknesses:
- The simplification of trees by partitioning MSAs into pairs of similar sequences may overlook the full structure of the MSA, reducing relationships to binary pairs, which explains accuracy loss compared to CherryML with FastTree.
- The novelty of the work is limited as it represents an incremental improvement over CherryML, with only marginal advancements in results.
- The paper lacks a comparison of computational resource usage, such as memory, and does not address the model's performance with datasets containing many gaps or its applicability to other biological data types.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis supporting the approximation of using pairs, demonstrating the types of data distributions that result in acceptable accuracy loss and quantifying worst-case scenarios. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed benchmarking process, including datasets used and potential biases, to enhance transparency and reproducibility. The authors should also explore the model's performance with datasets that have a high number of gaps and consider extending the methods to incorporate other biological data types, such as DNA/RNA sequences or structural alignments.
