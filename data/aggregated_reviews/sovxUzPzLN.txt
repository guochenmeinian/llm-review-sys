Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an approach to establish semantic correspondences using pre-trained stable diffusion models without task-specific fine-tuning. The authors optimize prompt embeddings to enhance cross-attention maps at specific pixel locations in a source image, subsequently applying this optimized prompt to identify corresponding locations in a target image. The method includes technical strategies such as averaging over multiple image crops and varying random embeddings. The results demonstrate near state-of-the-art performance in semantic matching.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The insight that stable diffusion models can learn semantic correspondences without task-specific training is novel and underexplored.
- The approach achieves competitive results compared to existing weakly-supervised methods, demonstrating its effectiveness.
- The paper is well-written and presents the material clearly.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks comparisons with significant existing work, particularly PWarpC, which outperforms the proposed method on key benchmarks, undermining claims of superiority.
- The approach is impractical due to its long runtime of 30 seconds per match, necessitating further experimentation with training a semantic matching model based on pseudo ground-truth matches.
- The optimization setup and implementation details are insufficiently described, particularly regarding the optimization algorithm for key equations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparative analysis by including results from PWarpC and other relevant works to validate their claims. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments to enhance the practicality of the approach, potentially by training a semantic matching model using pseudo ground-truth matches. Clarifying the optimization setup, including the specific algorithms used for equations, and providing a detailed runtime analysis would also strengthen the paper. Furthermore, addressing the resolution of extracted feature maps and their implications for performance is crucial.
