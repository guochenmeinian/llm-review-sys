Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the DeltaDEQ method, aimed at enhancing computational efficiency for implicit models represented by deep equilibrium models. The authors identify a heterogeneous convergence phenomenon, where different dimensions of DEQ hidden states converge at varying speeds. DeltaDEQ modifies the forward pass update using a delta rule that stores intermediate results and recalculates dimensions only when changes exceed a threshold. The method has been tested on implicit neural representation and optical flow tasks, demonstrating significant reductions in FLOPs while maintaining accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The concept of heterogeneous convergence is intriguing and may have broader implications for deep equilibrium models and other iterative methods.
2. DeltaDEQ does not assume temporal correlation of inputs, making it effective for static inputs, unlike fixed-point reuse acceleration.
3. The method achieves an 84% reduction in FLOPs for the INR task and 73% and 76% reductions for the OF task using the Sintel and KITTI datasets, respectively, without significant accuracy loss.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks detailed implementation specifics, particularly regarding sparse processing and threshold selection for DeltaDEQ.
2. There is insufficient comparison with state-of-the-art methods, which may undermine the demonstration of DeltaDEQ's superiority.
3. While FLOP reductions are mentioned, the paper does not provide details on actual running time or resource consumption, including memory usage.
4. The sensitivity of DeltaDEQ to threshold parameters and other hyperparameters is not fully explored, potentially affecting the method's stability and reliability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the implementation details provided, especially concerning sparse processing and threshold selection for DeltaDEQ. Additionally, the authors should include comparisons with current state-of-the-art methods to convincingly demonstrate DeltaDEQ's advantages. It would be beneficial to elaborate on actual running time and resource consumption metrics to complement the FLOP reductions reported. Furthermore, we suggest exploring the sensitivity of DeltaDEQ to threshold parameters and hyperparameters to enhance the method's robustness. Lastly, expanding the experimental results to include a wider variety of tasks and architectures, such as transformer-based models, would strengthen the paper's contributions.
