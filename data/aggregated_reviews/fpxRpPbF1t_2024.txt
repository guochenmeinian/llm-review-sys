### Key Points
This paper presents a differentiable model for synthesizing musical string sound and simulating motion based on physical properties. The authors propose Differentiable Modal Synthesis for Physical Modeling (DMSP), utilizing a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solver for numerical solutions, which serve as ground truth. A neural network pipeline maps physical properties to output waveforms, demonstrating superior performance compared to Modal synthesis and DDSPish baselines. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is among the first to explore neural audio synthesis using physical properties, contributing meaningfully to this sub-area.  
- The proposed method is efficient and accurate, outperforming reasonable baselines.  
- The paper is well-written, providing sufficient background, model descriptions, and experimental results.

Weaknesses:  
- The reliance on FDTD solutions raises concerns about the gap between simulated solutions and real-world audio data, particularly regarding the availability of real-world data for learning material properties.  
- Methodological details, such as the mathematical forms for pitch loss and mode frequency loss, lack clarity.  
- The mode predictor's performance is inadequate, as indicated by results in Table 2, questioning the justification of the proposed pipeline.  
- The advantages of the proposed physics-driven sound synthesis over existing neural generative models, like AudioLM or diffusion models, remain unclear.  
- There are several minor issues, including reference typos and confusion regarding the initial condition and operator definitions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of methodological details, particularly regarding the definitions and forms of pitch loss and mode frequency loss. Additionally, addressing the performance issues of the mode predictor is crucial for justifying the proposed pipeline. The authors should clarify the advantages of their approach over existing models and consider expanding the discussion of limitations, particularly regarding the mode predictor's failure and computational complexity. Lastly, correcting reference errors and clarifying the definitions related to initial conditions and operators would enhance the overall presentation.
