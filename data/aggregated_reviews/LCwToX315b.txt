Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on computing a low-rank approximation (LRA) for \( f(UV) \), where \( U \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times r} \), \( V \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times n} \), and \( f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) is applied entrywise. The authors show that subquadratic relative error LRA is unattainable under certain conditions, specifically when \( U \neq V^\top \) or when \( f \) is an approximate polynomial of \( |x| \). They provide an \( O(n \cdot poly(r^p, k, 1/\epsilon)) \)-time algorithm for relative error LRA and an \( O(n \cdot poly(p, k, 1/\epsilon)) \)-time algorithm for additive error LRA when \( f(x) = x^p \). Additionally, their techniques extend to lower bounds for implicit matrix-vector multiplications of the form \( f(UV)z \).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper significantly advances the understanding of LRA by addressing the asymmetric setting, which is a departure from prior research focused on the symmetric case. The results for relative error LRA closely match the upper bounds, and the lower bounds apply to a broader family of functions compared to previous work. The novel reductions from the orthogonal vector problem (OV) to LRA are technically sound and could facilitate future lower bounds in numerical linear algebra.

Weaknesses:  
The algorithms presented are relatively straightforward extensions of prior results, and the lower bound for even \( p \) is considered weak. The lower bounds do not account for the dimensions \( r \) and \( k \) of the input and output matrices. Additionally, there are typos in the proofs that hinder readability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the algorithms by providing more detailed explanations of their novelty and significance compared to existing literature. It would be beneficial to strengthen the lower bound for even \( p \) and to incorporate the dimensions \( r \) and \( k \) into the analysis. Furthermore, addressing the typos and unclear notations throughout the paper will enhance its readability. Lastly, including a discussion on the lower bound for additive error would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the upper bounds presented.
