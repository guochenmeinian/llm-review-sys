# Automated LLM-Based Peer Review System

This project uses LLM to auto-reviews the research paper.

- We crawled papers from openreview with top venues papers (e.g. ICML, NIPS, ICLR, CVPR) along with their reviews. The dataset is published in Huggingface and made public: [Link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/guochenmeinian/openreview)

- (TBD): We used Nougat-OCR to parse the PDF. With the raw data, We use LLM APIs to merge review data to prepare the dataset for training.

- (TBD): We applied QLora and Prefix Insertion to finetune on LLama3-8b-instruct-8k model with our dataset.

- (TBD): We further train the model with DPO technique to ensure accuracy.

The matching rate between the reviews generated by our model and the manual reviews surpassed the effect of GPT-4 reviewers, improving the accuracy of automated review.
